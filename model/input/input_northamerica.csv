1,The planned national waste policy won't deliver a truly circular economy,"Australia’s government has announced new planned waste recycling targets, as part of its response to the crisis prompted by China’s decision to crack down on recycling imports earlier this year.

The wider goal of Australia’s plan to update the National Waste Policy is to embrace circular economy principles.

That process is now in train. Following engagement with industry and government working groups, a proposed update to the policy is now open for public comment.

So how well does the proposed new policy incorporate circular economy principles? The short answer is, not well enough.

Read more: Explainer: what is the circular economy?

A circular economy is centred on keeping products, components and materials circulating in use for as long as possible, through long-lasting design, repair, reuse, re-manufacturing and recycling. The ultimate aim is to minimise the amount of resources consumed, and waste generated, by our economic activities.

The proposed principles, targets and strategies are a good start. They will help tackle a range of issues, including:
• increasing the currently limited responsibility for products at end of life
• focusing on organic waste (such as food and textiles), one of the major obstacles to current recovery rates

Yet these proposals, while all crucial, represent only a moderate evolution from our current situation, rather than the revolution needed to truly embrace the circular economy.

The policy’s major focus is still on recycling and recovery, and while recycling is certainly a “circular” activity, the circular economy involves so much more than simply improving how we reclaim and reprocess unwanted materials.

A truly circular society aims to transform our whole system of production and consumption, with innovative approaches like “products as services” (through leasing or collaborative consumption) and designing for next life and new life (through repairability, modularity and disassembly).

The proposed policy misses the opportunity to focus on innovation and create a step change in not only the resource recovery industry, but our whole economy and broader society.

The public arguably has more awareness of this issue than ever before, thanks to the continuing emergence of sustainability as a concept, combined with China’s shock to our recycling industry and the media focus afforded by campaigns such as the ABC’s War on Waste documentary series.

Public awareness and expectation is one thing, but to deliver on these goals the national waste policy must strengthen the explicit adoption of circular economy principles and significantly increase support to transition towards it.

This includes such things as:
• support for innovation in business models for circular economy
• standards for imports, not just local production
• federal tax incentives, funding, and research and development to enable all of the above.

Australia has a unique opportunity to lay the building blocks for the type of economy and society we want. Let’s hope we can get it right.",United States,2018.09
4,Black Bear Develops Carbonization Process for Tire Recycling,"The problem of disposal of tires that have reached the end of their lives is an age old one. On an annual basis, 1.5 billion tires need to be disposed of. Most of these tires either get dumped or incinerated, causing great damage to the environment with CO₂ emissions and using up valuable resources.

Black Bear has developed a special carbonization process that can help recover carbon black from used tires. The company has successfully completed a growth funding round of USD 12.8 million to further refine the environmentally friendly process and rollout the technology on a global scale.

Blackbear has taken on four new partners in the venture, including Dutch banking corporation ING Group, two Netherlands-based investment firms named 5square and Social Impact Ventures and the Thai conglomerate SCG.

Commenting on this development, Black Bear CEO Martijn Lopes Cardozo said that the members of the new consortium will work together as a team not just when it comes to infusion of capital but also as strategic partners, who will play a key role in development of the new technology and expedite its global roll-out. The consortium also includes Blackbear’s existing investors, including the original funders Chemelot Ventures and DOEN Participaties (Ventures).

Black Bear’s industrial-scale prototype plant for the process is located in Nederweert in the Netherlands and it has the capacity to process over one million waste tires every year. 5,000 tons of carbon black, 5,000 tons of bio-fuel, 3,000 tons of steel and 1MW hour of green electricity will be obtained as the byproducts of this process. Black Bear will operate the plant in partnership with Kargro, which is one of the leading recyclers of tires in Europe.

Mark Weustink, director of the corporate investment team at ING Group, said that it was remarkable how Black Bear developed the technology to generate energy while converting old tires into a very high-value product. Black Bear has already won some large clients such as AkzoNobel.”

Cholanat Yanaranop, president of the chemicals business at SCG said that the company was highly committed to the circular economy and Black Bear was helping to solve a global problem. The new technology will significantly improve the carbon footprint of carbon black production.

Helmer Schukken, co-founder and partner at Social Impact Ventures, said that his company believed in the huge positive environmental impact of the technology, especially as the carbon black produced using the technology is as good as virgin carbon black in terms of cost price and quality. Another reason Social Impact Ventures invested the funding round was that Black Bear’s great management team, which includes highly experienced professionals in the fields of sales, finance and other functions required for global roll-out in addition to talented engineers.

Mark Gitsels, founder and partner at 5square, added, “When you really think about it, it’s unbelievable that only 10% of our resources are currently part of circular economies. That’s why we full-heartedly support the outstanding management team of Black Bear. Their disruptive technology is an opportunity for us to help make the world that bit better and at the same time yield attractive returns.”",United States,2018.09
8,"Moutai Group Won ""2018 World Green Design Forum Special Contribution Award""","According to the sponsors, the World Green Design Forum is an international sustainable development high-level dialogue platform initiated by Lu Yongxiang, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the 11th National People's Congress of China and an academician and former Dean of Chinese Academy of Sciences, and established by Dragon Design Foundation, Association Amitie Euro-Chinoise, International Council of Design, European Regional Bureau of Xinhua News Agency, China Top Brands, a magazine supervised by Xinhua News Agency, Swiss QSC Funds, etc. The first forum was held in Lugano of Switzerland in 2011. This Summit was sponsored by the World Green Design Organization and China-Europe Forum, co-sponsored by the China Top Brands, a magazine supervised by Xinhua News Agency, and co-organized by more than 10 organizations including Innovation Norway and Dragon Design Foundation.

Professional individuals and organizations committed to promoting the application of green technologies, materials, energy and equipment with green designs and improving the living environment of mankind were commended at this Summit. Among them, Moutai Group was granted with ""2018 World Green Design Forum Special Contribution Award"" due to its contributions in environmental protection.

As introduced, the contributions made by Moutai Group to environmental protection can be classified into the following six aspects. Firstly, it has deeply carried out pollution prevention and control, established five sewage treatment facilities and entrusted professional third-party agencies to manage them. They can treat 23,000 tons of sewage per day, whose discharge meets relevant standards. According to the statistics, Moutai Group has treated a total of 2.28 million tons of sewage, whose discharge meets relevant standards, in 2017, reducing COD by 5,756.81 tons and ammonia nitrogen by 65.14 tons and achieving a treatment compliance rate of 100%. Secondly, it has promoted the ""Burning Gas instead of Coal"" project. Moutai Group has established 24 610t/h gas-fired boilers in lieu of original 22 400t/h coal-fired boilers, reducing annual coal consumption volume by 140,000 tons, annual SO2 emissions by 6,048 tons and annual smoke and dust emissions by 7,000 tons. According to the statistics, it has effectively monitored air quality in its plant areas for 357 days in 2017, including 357 days of good air quality. The rate of good air quality reached 100%. Furthermore, it has actively saved energy and reduced emissions, and recycled any cooling water from production in liquor-making workshops, continuously reducing comprehensive energy consumption per unit Moutai liquor product. A bottle washing water recycling system was also established in the packing workshops, so that about 130,000 tons of water is saved every year.

Next, Moutai Group has made great efforts to construct the automatic pollution monitoring facility and improve the scientific supervision level for environmental protection. Its sewage treatment plants all have added three new pollutant monitoring indicators (i.e. total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and suspended solids) to their online waste water monitoring systems in addition to original COD and ammonia nitrogen. There are a total of 30 sets of monitoring equipment, whose data is transmitted via network to Zunyi Environmental Monitoring Central Station of Guizhou Province, China. Then, Zunyi Environmental Monitoring Central Station of Guizhou Province truly reflects the environmental quality, sewage discharge condition, pollutant discharge strength and their change trends of Moutai Group by virtue of the monitoring big data, and deeply analyzes the change trend of environmental quality, so as to scientifically and effectively conduct environmental risk assessment and environmental accident early warning. Besides, Moutai Group has strengthened the environmental governance and ecological protection in Chishui River basin.

Since 2014, it has annually contributed RMB 50 million to Sichuan Provincial People's Government as a special environmental protection fund for consecutive 10 years. Finally, it has established a circular economy industry demonstration park, promoted comprehensive organic utilization of distillers' soluble wastes, achieved an annual treatment capacity of around 100,000 steamers of distillers' soluble wastes and maximized the reduction of solid waste discharge, achieving corporate ""green, low-carbon and circulative"" development.",United States,2018.09

16,Shifting Infrastructure Landscapes in a Circular Economy: An Institutional Work Analysis of the Water and Energy Sector,"Under pressure by the transition towards a circular economy, the infrastructure landscape is changing. Using Institutional Work as an analytical lens, this article analyses the work actors do to change and adapt institutional structures. In this process of restructuring, the research shows that there are four dominant types of institutional work: Enabling, Constructing Identities, Constructing Normative Networks, and Changing Normative Associations. The increasing fragmentation of infrastructure as well as the increasing connections made between different flows forces organisations to readjust their internal institutions as well as those that guide their interactions with their surroundings such as other organisational actors as well as citizens. Circularity requires a restructuring of infrastructure governance in order to adapt to the increasing flux caused by decentralised technologies and the need for integration of different systems. Additionally, the actors associated with energy and water infrastructure are responding accordingly. View Full-Text",United States,2018.09
18,Taiwan’s EPA Turns Hazardous Waste Into Raw Materials With New LCD Recycling Process,"Taiwan’s EPA Turns Hazardous Waste Into Raw Materials With New LCD Recycling Process

Environmental Protection Administrations (EPA) around the world utilize a wide range of tactics to encourage more environmentally responsible behavior from the companies they regulate, spanning the full gamut from the carrot to the stick.

CleanTechnica spoke with Taiwan’s Environmental Protection Administration at the Taiwan Circular Economy show, which was co-located with 2018 Energy Taiwan last week in Taipei. EPA expert Shan-lun Lee shared a new recycling program with us that the agency has developed in conjunction with the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) that enables discarded liquid crystal display (LCD) panels to be broken down and recycled into fresh new raw materials.

The new process is a vast improvement on the old process for handling discarded LCD panels, which consisted of literally burying them. I’m sure that’s going to come back to bite us in the hindquarters in the future, but for now, it’s exciting to have a new and improved process to handle the waste and turn it back into granulated glass particles and a refined liquid that is used in between the layers of the liquid crystal displays themselves.

The new nanotech process that is used to break the glass down results in a fine white powdered glass that can be used for a variety of downstream value-add processes. One of the early uses for the glass powder is as a filter media that is already being used to filter out heavy metals like cadmium and copper from wastewater.

Managing water runoff from industrial facilities is a key part of environmental compliance, and much of that work is focused on minimizing the metals in the runoff. The ability to utilize the powdered glass to filter metals out of the water is a nice use case that also helps to improve the health of the environment. After the metals have been filtered out, they can be extracted from the filter media and appropriately managed.

Alternately, the powdered glass material can also be used to make new glass products, albeit at a slightly lower quality than pure glass feedstock.

The new ITRI process captures the liquid from the discarded LCDs and purifies it back to a usable quality. It is not at the same quality as virgin LCD liquid but a demonstration display that showed LCDs produced using virgin fluid and reclaimed fluid side by side showed just how functional the reclaimed fluid is in new products. I couldn’t tell the difference, for what that’s worth, but I make no claims to be an expert in LCD quality.

The new recycling process highlights the opportunity for environmental protection agencies to use their power and authority to work with businesses and non-profits like ITRI to develop new ways of handing waste that do less harm to the planet or better yet, turn waste products into usable raw materials. The carrot is always more fun and effective than the stick.",United States,2018.09
21,Trower: 'UK must address plastics reprocessing gap',"Recycling and waste management firm, Viridor, has called on the UK to address its “reprocessing capacity gap” for plastics, if it is to achieve future recycling targets and move towards a “truly circular economy.”

The need for action was highlighted by Viridor Resource Management managing director, Keith Trower, today after the company issued its 2018 Viridor Recycling Index. This week, the growing concern for plastics has reached an “all time high,” according to the report, where “four in five” respondents believed the UK should be finding alternative methods to deal with its own recycling, instead of exporting it to other countries.

The document also cited that 83% of respondents said they would be encouraged to increase their recycling activities, if they knew it would be utilised to produce renewable energy. Meanwhile, 75% of people surveyed said they understood the term “Right Stuff, Right Bin” and 45% were willing to pay additional tax on non-recyclable plastics.

Mr Trower said: “We need to support the circular economy. The fact that China closed its doors creates a huge opportunity for investment and manufacturing in Europe.

“We cannot send the plastic to landfill and we should aim to minimise non-recyclable plastics used for energy recovery. There are not any collective markets as big as China for export, so effectively the plastics we were exporting now have to be processed in Europe and the UK. This requires government support.”

Adding to Mr Trower’s views, Phil Piddington, managing director of Viridor, commented: “Public concern over the environmental impact of plastics continues to gain momentum in the UK, in parallel to a broader awareness of the importance of recycling generally.

“The 2018 Index shows that not only are people increasingly confused over what and how they can recycle, they’re also becoming less confident that businesses or government are playing their respective roles in ensuring resources are given new life,” adding that Viridor is working closely with retailers and packaging manufacturers to make products, such as plastics, more recyclable.”

Mr Trower stated that a form of PRN reform could address “market volatility” through guaranteeing a minimum fixed price PRN value equitable to the cost of processing the material.

He explained: “This would give reprocessors the certainty needed to make a more informed decision on the viability of large scale investments and, therefore, not only promote recycling capacity but also promote UK infrastructure and business in the face of Brexit.

“Several leading brand owners are known to be looking at ways that they can increase the recycled content within their packaging products. One of the barriers in achieving their ambitious voluntary targets is the availability of suitable capacity within the UK market.”

A number of retailers have individual targets in place for making their packaging more recyclable. Coca-Cola, for example, has pledged to recycle 40% of its materials in packaging by 2020, while L’Oreal said 100% of its packaging will be rechargeable, refillable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. Similarly, P&G is aiming for a target of 50% within the same year as L’Oreal, said Viridor.

“Ultimately, we need more consistent collections, we need to continue to educate and engage the public on plastics recycling, and we need more recycled plastics going into domestic manufacturing,” Mr Trower commented. “With effective EPR & PRN reform and with clear government support, our sector stands ready to deliver the vital additional services and infrastructure required.”",United States,2018.09
24,Sustana and the Carton Council Want to Close the Recycling Gap in Wisconsin,"According to a recent survey, Wisconsin ranks third in terms of being supportive of recycling, with almost 80 percent of residents reporting that they recycle. However, not all residents know that food and beverage cartons, such as those that package milk, juice and broth, should also be recycled.

To help ensure more Wisconsin residents know to recycle their cartons, the Carton Council, an industry organization whose mission is to increase recycling of food and beverage cartons in the U.S. and Canada, is launching a consumer education campaign in the state. Starting now through the end of the year, residents in Appleton, Green Bay, Madison, Milwaukee, Racine and Waukesha will see information on social media alerting them that food and beverage carton recycling is available in their area. Using innovative digital outreach approaches including a Facebook chatbot, an online quiz and pledge, the campaign will seek to convert audiences into carton recycling champions.

“With this campaign, we are hoping to reinforce that residents should do all they can to recycle their food and beverage cartons because they truly are needed and have a local impact,” said Jason Pelz, vice president of recycling projects for the Carton Council of North America and circular economy director for Tetra Pak. “While 79 percent of residents report they recycle materials like aluminum cans, paper and plastic bottles, that number drops to 68 percent for food and beverage cartons, showing there is room for improvement.”

There is a local connection to carton recycling in Wisconsin. Once food and beverage cartons have been sorted and baled at a sorting facility, they are sent to pulp mills like Sustana’s mill, Fox River Fiber, located in De Pere, WI. Sustana is a pulp mill equipped to separate the different materials cartons are made of, and the extracted fiber is turned into pulp that is used to produce a variety of paper-based products.

“Here at Sustana, we are proud to convert recycled carton fiber that will be leveraged in a broad range of our products—tissue, printing and writing paper, and food packaging,” said Jay Hunsberger, VP of Sales and Marketing at Sustana.“ Sustana employs 100 people from the community, demonstrating a sustainable manufacturing process that contributes a positive impact in the local area. By partnering with municipalities and being part of this supply chain, we contribute to the longevity of our community sustainability and preventing waste to landfill.”

Additionally, as if further reinforcement was needed to demonstrate the state’s commitment to recycling, the Associated Recyclers of Wisconsin (AROW) has a statewide program called Recycle More Wisconsin that aims to educate residents about all recycling in the state. AROW has long been a supporter of the Carton Council’s mission to increase awareness of carton recycling.

The Carton Council formed in 2009 to increase recycling of cartons used to package many food and beverage products, such as milk, juice, water, soups, broth, wine and beans. At that time, only 18 percent of households could recycle their cartons through local programs. Now, more than 62 percent of homes have access, representing 73.2 million households in 13,427 communities.

25,Agreement signed between Italy and China exhibition groups,"Italian Exhibition Group inked an agreement with Chengdu ZhongLian Exhibition Co., which organizes Chengdu Environmental Protection Expo.

On September 20, Italian Exhibition Group (IEG) inked an agreement with Chengdu ZhongLian Exhibition Co. Ltd., the Chinese company that organizes the Chengdu Environmental Protection Expo (CDEPE).

The agreement was signed in the presence of the undersecretary for Economic Development, Prof. Michele Geraci, during the inauguration day of the Italia Pavilion at the 17th edition of the Western China International Fair di Chengdu (WCIF), a governmental expo event of southwestern China, at which Italy was the Guest of Honor country.

Stipulated through EAGLE, the joint venture between IEG and VNU Exhibitions Asia, the agreement foresees an operation for the purchase of 60% of the CDEPE exhibition, ratifying the launch of the partnership between the two companies for the development and organization of expo events in the industry of green technologies and environmental protection with a particular focus on Western China.

The operation has the advantage of the expertise of Ecomondo organized by IEG (Rimini Expo Centre, 6-9 November 2018). The collaboration aims at the development of CDEPE (being held in 2019 from March 22-24, precisely in Chengdu), with an increase in the participation of high-tech international enterprises with innovative products and services, international buyers, and know-how on European technology in the field of green technologies. CDEPE will feature the participation of over 300 exhibitors, a layout divided into functional targeted areas, and the supervision of an authoritative scientific committee. The partnership’s objectives also include the commitment of CDEPE to favouring the incoming of qualified Chinese industry/trade members to Ecomondo 2018.

Ecomondo was also a key player at the Western China International Fair di Chengdu (WCIF), thanks to the long-term collaboration between IEG and ICE Italian Trade and Investment Agency, where in fact it was part of the Italian delegation of 55 companies in the Italia Pavilion, in one of the five thematic areas dedicated to the Environment and Sustainable Urbanization.

Lastly, in the context of the program of international cooperation between China and Italy held during the exhibition, on September 23, the Sino Italian Summit on Circular Economy and Green Growth was organized by the Italian General Consulate of Chongqing in collaboration with IEG, the Department of Environmental Protection of Sichuan, the Department of Exhibition Business of Sichuan, the Italian Chamber of Commerce in China and EEGEX – Energy Environment Global Exchange.

27,Tuning in to value: How Sky redesigned its set-top box for the circular economy,"When pay-TV broadcaster Sky Deutschland set out four years ago to develop a new set-top box, which processes a satellite, cable, or internet video stream and feeds it to a viewer’s TV, its foremost goals were to provide customers with cutting-edge capabilities and to achieve improvements in operational efficiency and environmental performance. Those goals led the company to engineer the new device, known as Sky+ Pro, for durability, reuse, and easy upgrades with a circular design—an approach that reflects the idea of the circular economy. It complemented those qualities with a sleek, user-friendly look that won a Red Dot Award for product design and several other awards. Sebastian Hauptmann, Sky Deutschland’s executive vice president of operations, spoke with McKinsey’s Eric Hannon about the company’s efforts to integrate circular-economy ideas with a great customer experience.

McKinsey: What was your approach to designing earlier generations of set-top boxes?

Sebastian Hauptmann: The last time we launched a new set-top box was after Premiere, our predecessor company, was rebranded Sky Deutschland in 2009. Our priority was to add features like digital video recording and on-demand viewing of recent programs. We also wanted the boxes to reinforce the company’s new identity. All this had to be accomplished quickly. To save time, we reused hardware and middleware from other Sky divisions and adapted their features for our German market. Since the box met our specifications, worked well, and looked good at the time, it was the right approach.

McKinsey: What made you reconsider that approach to creating set-top boxes?

Sebastian Hauptmann: After I joined the company in 2010, we initiated a drive for cost savings and operational efficiency that looked at everything from design to sourcing. Since the company owned the set-top boxes and leased them to customers, we saw an opportunity to make the box less expensive across the life cycle. The OEM paid for repairs as long as the boxes were under warranty. But as more boxes outlasted their warranties, we spent a lot on refurbishment, repairs, returns, and shipping.

We also wanted to improve the customer experience. The typical set-top box lasted seven years or more, which is long for consumer electronics. In that time, a customer’s needs for TV service might change, or the customer might move from a satellite household to a cable household or vice versa. The box can stop working if a component fails, or the box’s specifications can fall behind the requirements of our service. When something goes wrong with the box, the customer has to send it back, which interrupts his or her viewing. We felt we could manage the boxes in a better way for customers.

McKinsey: How did you start to address these issues?

Sebastian Hauptmann: We began by looking for ways to lower costs in the return process. A simple but valuable change was having the repair-service company recover used accessories, like remote controls, cables, and power-supply units, and refurbish them to be used again. When a customer sent back a set-top box with a problem, we could swap the faulty component for a refurbished one.

Next, we started collecting more information about the problems with returned boxes. Our previous repair-service providers examined set-top boxes returned as faulty only to diagnose failures. When we consolidated and switched to a new repair-service provider in 2012, we asked the company to follow an automated screening process that would pick up every problem for every box—not just obvious causes of failure but also issues that are intermittent or less apparent.

McKinsey: What did you learn from all that information?

Sebastian Hauptmann: It helped us understand the box’s total cost of ownership, from supplying boxes through supporting them over their lifetimes, including service, repairs, and returns. We could see which parts of the box added the most to its total cost of ownership. For example, we found we could lower the costs of repairs and give subscribers a better experience by switching to modular hard drives. Customers can disconnect the hard drive from the box when something goes wrong with one of them. If the box develops a problem, the customer can keep his or her hard drive with all his or her recorded programs. If the hard drive fails, the customer can send it back while keeping the set-top box so he or she can continue to receive live and on-demand TV service.

McKinsey: Where did that discovery lead you?

Sebastian Hauptmann: After we saw the benefits of decoupling the hard drive from the main unit, we reasoned that we could extend the same logic to the entire design. The easier we made it to fix or replace just the faulty parts of a box, the more we could save by keeping functional parts in service. And extending the life of the box would lower the total cost of ownership. That’s when we started thinking of the set-top box as a circular product.

But the box hadn’t necessarily been designed to last a long time. It was designed to be manufactured inexpensively. Some components were glued in or snapped together, which made them difficult to take apart. We knew we would have to rethink the design, with the aim of making the box modular, durable, easy to repair, and economical.

McKinsey: How did you approach that effort?

Sebastian Hauptmann: Sky’s contract with the manufacturers of the last-generation box was ending. That gave us an opportunity to reset our expectations for the OEM. When we wrote the tender [request for proposals] to manufacture the new box, we included requirements that would help us make the box more reusable and cost effective.

One provision required the OEM to collaborate with the repair-service company. We had switched a while ago to having OEMs rely on the repair company’s diagnostic data rather than do their own inspections. The next step was to ensure that the OEM made full use of the repair company’s insights in designing the box. We also wanted the repair-service company and the OEM to refine the repair-inspection process so the findings would be more useful to the OEM in the future.

Another requirement was for the OEM to work with us directly on designing a box with a lower cost of ownership. One of the companies that had made the last-generation box came up with an outstanding approach. It promised to set up an office less than one kilometer from our main office, so it could work closely with our product team. It also offered to send design and engineering experts to Germany to work with us several days each week throughout the three-month design process. This “one roof” approach—where specialists work together in the same place—accelerated the process and led to great outcomes.

McKinsey: What design changes resulted from your work with the OEM?

Sebastian Hauptmann: We changed the design in many ways, which can be sorted into two main categories. One is electrical design. We improved the quality of some components, like the smart-card reader and the electrolytic capacitors, so they would fail less often. We got rid of all the buttons except for a single reset button. We also reconfigured the components inside the case. For example, using Serial ATA [advanced technology attachment] connectors that are straight rather than angled made them easier to repair. The biggest benefit of reorganizing the components was improving airflow enough that the box wouldn’t need a fan.

Another set of changes had to do with the outer case. Driving and removing the screws in the case adds time to manufacturing and repairs. We got rid of screws by using a snap mechanism that was safe but easy to open with a special tool. We also switched to sturdier materials for parts that experience less wear and tear and inexpensive materials for parts that need to be replaced frequently. The top panel, in particular, gets scratched a lot. Sometimes customers put stickers on it. Now we make it out of low-cost plastic, and it’s no trouble to snap on and off. We also use this modular top panel to offer branded receivers, such as a receiver in the colors of a customer’s favorite football club—a nice way to use circular design to generate incremental revenues.

McKinsey: Coming up with a circular design couldn’t have been easy, even with a cooperative manufacturer. What challenges did you run into?

Sebastian Hauptmann: It took some time to convince our colleagues that we should redesign the box. Once we decided to do that, we didn’t have in-house experts in design or engineering to drive the process. We ended up hiring a design agency.

Furthermore, it was important to gather opinions from internal groups and get their support for the choices we were exploring. That helped build a sense of ownership for the box, which we needed when it came time to market and sell it. Finally, it was important to apply good judgment on trade-offs. For example, our marketing colleagues clearly preferred a polished Sky logo on top of the box, while a matte finish was preferable from a circular-design perspective. We found a great solution to that: making the logo polished but embossed on the top cover, so it rarely gets scratched.

McKinsey: How have customers responded to these new set-top boxes?

Sebastian Hauptmann: Customer satisfaction has gone up since we brought out the new set-top boxes, which is great. A key reason for this is that the integrated Wi-Fi makes it easier to consume on-demand content, which is an important driver for customer satisfaction. We were careful to check that the new box would satisfy customers. Every time we came up with a design change to improve cost or durability, we did our best to confirm that customers would like it. That was mostly a matter of holding focus groups.

Of course, many of the boxes we issue have been refurbished. But no one seems to mind as long as they work well and look great. Before we send out a box, we make sure it’s fully functional and looks new. If the box breaks, we ship a replacement. We take care of all repairs and pay for the shipping. And we make regular upgrades to provide better functionality. A massive improvement in the user experience happened when we pushed our Sky Q software to more than a million customers in mid-2018.

McKinsey: Owning the boxes has different financial implications from selling them. How do you manage those?

Sebastian Hauptmann: We strive to provide a great service to our customers. Both the hardware and software are the means to that end. Since we deliver service on a monthly basis, we prefer to bill people in the same way for the set-top box they need rather than asking them to make a single, up-front payment for it.

The choice to monetize the set-top box on a recurring basis makes it more practical for us to own and lease the boxes and gives us a strong incentive to manage the total cost of ownership. In that respect, a circular design has clear financial advantages over a conventional design for both the provider and the customer.

McKinsey: Where do you go from here? How do you capture more value?

Sebastian Hauptmann: We see opportunities to use materials more efficiently. We’re exploring ways to develop secondary markets for components, like hard drives, that still have utility after they fail. At the group level, Sky is aiming to eliminate single-use plastics from its supply chain as part of the Sky Ocean Rescue initiative. We will soon do this with the packaging for the set-top box. Now we’re looking into redesigning the box’s packaging to reduce the amount of cardboard.

We’re also trying to virtualize Sky’s service so it depends less on the box and gives customers more choice. With the new Sky Q software, for example, just one set-top box lets customers in the same household watch our service on up to five devices using smart TV apps or other existing equipment, such as game consoles. Before this, customers needed an additional smart card and set-top box for every room where they wanted to watch Sky’s service.

We follow the mantra of “no hardware or great hardware.” If a customer wants to use our service on a device other than the TV, we enable that with software. If a customer wants the best possible TV experience, we are happy to provide the hardware that allows this. We just want to ensure that our customers can enjoy great entertainment whenever and wherever they want to.",United States,2018.09
30,"Canadian Businesses, NGOs Form Circular Economy Coalition | News | SDG Knowledge Hub | IISD","20 September 2018: A group of companies and think tanks has formed the Circular Economy Leadership Coalition (CELC) to eliminate waste, accelerate carbon emission reductions and build a sustainable, prosperous Canada. Members announced the coalition at the Group of 7 (G7) Ministerial Meeting in Halifax, Canada, which brought together environment, oceans and energy ministers.

CELC aims to support a shift from unsustainable resource extraction towards a circular economy in which resource productivity is increased, items are designed to use less material, last longer, be reused or be repaired, pollutants and toxins are eliminated from the system and any generated waste becomes an input back into the system. The Coalition will foster collaboration among all levels of government, industries, experts and communities in the development and implementation of circular economy solutions that protect and regenerate the natural environment while also enhancing prosperity, including through developing a Circular Economy Roadmap. For instance, the Coalition will promote enhanced understanding of the barriers and benefits associated with eliminating waste and transitioning to a circular economy.

Coalition members include: Unilever Canada; IKEA Canada; Loblaw Companies Limited; Walmart Canada; NEI Investments LP; International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD); National Zero Waste Council; Smart Prosperity Institute; The Natural Step Canada; and Institut EDDEC – Environment, Sustainable Development and the Circular Economy.

UNILEVER Canada Vice-President and General Counsel and CELC Co-chair John Coyne stressed the need to radically transform current modes of production, distribution and disposal to enable a smarter, more productive cycle of productivity with both economic and environmental benefits. He said the CELC can “kickstart the critical mass of support needed across businesses, government and civil society to allow this economic transformation to occur.”

At the G7 ministerial meeting, CELC signed the G7 Ocean Plastics Charter, which will adopt a circular economy approach to minimize plastic in the environment, among other actions. [CELC Website] [CELC Press Release]",United States,2018.09
33,Introducing a more circular economy will meet with resistance,"A SINGLE, BARE lightbulb helps illuminate part of the Livermore-Pleasanton fire department on the eastern edge of the San Francisco Bay area. It does not look out of place, if a little dim. But it is no humdrum piece of electrical equipment. For the Centennial Light, as it is known, has been burning almost continuously since 1901. To proponents of a less resource-intensive, more circular economy, the bulb (pictured) shows that everyday products can be affordable and built to last.

Not everyone has an interest in such longevity, however. In 1924 a cartel of big lightbulb manufacturers, including General Electric, Osram and Philips, agreed to keep lifetimes of their products to 1,000 hours or so, down from an average of 2,500 hours, in order to sell more of them. Many companies still make it difficult, or even illegal, to mend their products. This has provoked push-back from customers demanding a “right to repair”. French prosecutors are investigating whether Apple, which has admitted slowing older iPhones with software upgrades, deliberately intended to shorten the product’s lifetime to make customers replace it—a criminal offence in France. Legal or not, such activities look economically inefficient and environmentally foolish, even though they may make perfect sense for individual companies. The question is how to persuade those firms to go against their apparent self-interest in order to create a more circular economy.

Forecasts can help focus minds. Last year the International Resource Panel, an independent scientific body under the auspices of the UN Environment Programme, suggested that wiser use of resources could add $2trn, or roughly the GDP of Italy, to the global economy by 2050. Limiting food waste alone could contribute $252bn a year by 2030. Analysis by Circle Economy, a consultancy, found that, of the 84bn tonnes of materials consumed each year by the global economy—including biomass, sand, metals and fossil fuels—barely 9% are reused.

Workers need not lose out, either—in their jobs or as shoppers able to snap up more durable smartphones. A series of reports for the Club of Rome, a think-tank, found that, if product lifetimes were doubled and half the virgin materials consumed today replaced with recovered ones, the resulting economic shift would create 200,000 net new jobs in Spain and 300,000 in France. (Improving energy efficiency and replacing half of all fossil fuels used with renewables would add another 565,000 jobs across all the countries studied.) Most new work would come in green industries such as recycling. After reviewing 65 studies on the effects of a more circular economy, academics at the University of Augsburg found that related job creation outweighs job destruction. A report by McKinsey said the global net employment gains would be anywhere between 9m and 25m jobs.

The environment would benefit, with fewer mines, more trees and less need for landfills and incinerators. Recycling aluminium saves 95% of energy compared with smelting new metal. The savings are 88% for plastic, 60% for steel and paper, and 38% for glass. According to Sitra, Finland’s state-run innovation fund, raising recycling rates for aluminium, steel and plastic by 50-80% would cut European industrial emissions, which account for one-tenth of the continent’s total, by a third.

However, what makes sense environmentally may not look good for the bottom line of an individual company or region. The most obvious casualties would be purveyors of fossil fuels, minerals, agricultural produce and other primary materials, the demand for which would suffer. If everything else remained constant, eliminating 1.3bn tonnes of food waste could mean $750bn less in sales for farmers—the value which the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation ascribes to all the food spoiled or lost annually between farm and fridge. More durable consumer products could mean that fewer have to be made, potentially hurting manufacturers’ volumes. More Uber rides may ultimately lead to fewer people buying cars of their own. Less need to ferry merchandise could hit shipping companies, too. The Club of Rome study found that, in Poland, where many people continue to be employed in agriculture, more productive use of resources could potentially destroy jobs overall.

Politicians in most rich countries may calculate that repatriating offshored factory jobs to plants back home where recovered materials are reprocessed is a vote-winner. But it may be less appealing to their counterparts in poorer places where workers found employment in manufacturing. Research by Garth Frazer of the University of Toronto found that clothes donated to Africa harmed African garment-makers. Between 1981 and 2000 second-hand imports explain two-fifths of the decline in African apparel production and half of the fall in garment-industry employment. South Africa has restricted imports of used Western garb. Six countries of the East African Community are considering a ban. China already has one.

This leads to a final concern about “closing the loop” of circularity: that it can ring-fence parts of economy from globalisation. As Mr Abbasov of Scrapo laments, the circular economy rarely crosses borders. Sometimes, as in the case of the Chinese ban on foreign recovered plastic and paper, ring-fencing seems to be the explicit objective. But it can also be an unintended consequence. New repair shops would by their nature be more local. Recyclers often gripe about national and international rules which, by not drawing a clear distinction as to what is hazardous, raise transport costs and hamper trade. For second-hand electronics, which are treated as waste even if they are in perfectly good working order, regulations make it several times costlier to freight within most countries and almost impossible to send abroad. “Our industry has been in almost constant strife with regulators,” grumbles Ranjit Singh Baxi, president of the Bureau for International Recycling.

Such concerns are real. But they are not insuperable. For a start, other things are never constant. Populations grow; by 2050 Earth will have 2bn more consumers and mouths to feed. As people become richer, they consume more. In poor places like Lesotho, whose citizens waste little, consumption can increase by a lot before it comes close to Western levels—especially if it is accompanied by improvements in rubbish collection. African garment-workers deserve assistance, but shoppers there benefit from cheap, decent-quality foreign wear. And “circular” industries create employment in their own right.

Even if Club of Rome or McKinsey forecasts prove wide of the mark, history teaches that reshaping the economy creates more work than it destroys. Waste disposal generates just 0.1 job per 1,000 tonnes, compared with two jobs recycling the same amount, according to one study. A single Kenyan e-recycling programme is estimated to have generated over 2,000 jobs within four years of its launch. Recycling and repair industries could go global, too. Platforms like Scrapo or MerQbiz lubricate the exchange of recyclables across borders, showing that circular economies are not inherently protectionist.

The right response is therefore to experiment, not eschew resource efficiency. As this report has illustrated, there are signs that this is happening. Cities in the developing world are trying to get better at collecting rubbish and making sure that as little as possible goes to waste. The Chinese import ban is stirring many people in the West to relearn how to recycle. Campaigners and entrepreneurs are chivvying them along. Governments, especially in the West, are crafting “circular” strategies. By 2035 all EU states will be required by law to recover 65% of their rubbish, from an average of 40% today. America under Donald Trump is an exception, but American cities and states are compensating by helping people sort their rubbish and send less to the landfill.

Yet, while rich countries are cleaning up at home, they are only beginning to deal with the fact that (as with carbon emissions) they have exported their throwaway Industrial Revolution model around the world, outsourcing their waste to developing countries. Westerners continue to enjoy products that are made elsewhere, and whose disposal does not affect them personally. Rather than being smug about how well they are doing at home, they need now to encourage the developing world in its quest for a less wasteful growth model.

Some middle-income countries appear willing to listen (see chart). China’s latest five-year plan reaffirms its commitment to a “circular economy” and last year’s party congress called for the creation of a “waste-free society”. Indonesia, Nigeria and other emerging economies are emulating developed ones by making producers help pay for managing the waste created by their own products.

Most have a long way to go before they emulate Taiwan. Poor countries must prepare to cope with an increase in waste as they develop a middle class consuming at Western levels. Only when they see that proper handling of solid waste can aid prosperity will the global tide of rubbish be stemmed.",United States,2018.09
34,EU mandatory content requirement 'possible' for plastics,"With the UK likely to adopt the EU’s Circular Economy measures in its forthcoming Waste and Resources Strategy, Jeff Cooper reports on a European event which also heard that mandatory recycled content for plastics could become an EU requirement.

Bringing the Action Plan to Life – Towards a Fact Based Circular Economy

While the Prime Minister was having a hard time in Salzburg at the EU Summit on 20 September, in the Austrian capital, Vienna there were more than 400 participants tackling an equally vexed issue in a conference entitled “Bringing the Action Plan to Life – Towards a Fact Based Circular Economy”. Although the package of legislation covering the circular economy legislation for the European Community was only finally approved on 4 July 2018, the European Commission’s package of proposals announced on 2 December 2015 included an action plan, on which the European Commission has been working over the last three years.

This conference was co-sponsored by the Austrian Federal Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism and the first Austrian EPR scheme, ARA (Altstoff Recycling Austria AG). The conference also promoted the aims of the ARA-sponsored organisation Circular Economy Coalition for Europe (www.cec4europe.eu). This is one of the many ways in which the current concern to progress national and global companies towards more circular economy perspectives can be influenced using best practices and sound information.

Therefore, unsurprisingly, there were several presentations from key EU Commission civil servants from the main Directorates which are influential in implementing the Action Plan.

Hugo-Maria Schally from DG Environment stated that 54 of the 78 actions for implementation of the circular economy (CE) Action Plan had already been started.

Mr Schally went on to highlight the current interest in plastics waste, which is being addressed by the EU’s plastics strategy and he noted there is a strong possibility of a mandatory recycled content for plastics products in order to stimulate the market for recovered plastics waste.

For bio-wastes recovery there will be the bio-economy strategy to be unveiled by the Commission later this year, an action plan for more sustainable products and a product policy framework. There was now also a Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform to bring together all sectors and interests to progress the CE programme and he noted that there was not a truly functioning market in Europe for secondary raw materials. Mr Schally concluded by stating that there was an important issue that the Commission was currently working on – the interface between waste regulation and chemicals legislation which would have implications for waste recovery for the future, which is critical for ensuring waste is recycled.

A further speaker from the Commission, Gwenole Cozigou from DG GROW, started his presentation by stating that both Directorates (ENV and GROW) had worked closely together from the start and that the perception of the European community had changed towards the CE concept over the past five years. He noted that only 10% of raw material used in the EU is circular according to Eurostat. However, there are a number of potential future issues that would affect the future of economic development in the EU. These include:-

· Raw materials supplies, because the EU is heavily dependent on imports and often these come from politically less stable areas

· The need to adopt SMART technologies

· The need to harness venture capital funds to promote the CE

The event then heard from Helmut Rechberger, a Professor at the Vienna University of Technology and a key player in the ARA-sponsored Circular Economy for Europe (CEC4E) programme. The CEC4E was established in 2015 to support European and national decision makers in the transition towards a more circular economy.

A CEC4E Fact Book for the Circular Economy, which is only available online, so far has 23 contributions by 41 authors with 4-6 pages of content on each subject that is covered, such as: the basics of the CE, definitions, economic perspectives, principal objectives and strategies and instruments to move towards a more CE. There are also several contributions on selected materials.

To date there are 70 conclusions and recommendations in the Fact Book, which Helmut Rechberger had condensed to 7 key perspectives for the conference. The first was that recycling and the CE are only a means to achieve sustainable resource management rather than an aim. Therefore waste prevention is not a goal, indeed physically impossible. Secondly there is a need to recognise that there are optimal recycling rates and these are affected by ecological and economic factors and therefore will be dynamic and subject to changes over time.

In addition, suggested Mr Rechberger, qualitative targets are needed to maintain cleaner recycling cycles but also cannot avoid the need for new primary raw materials. In consequence, as a result of growing stock levels, for example in urban infrastructure we need to balance our needs with use of less material. There is a need for more and better quality data to enable much clearer systems understanding.

There has to be both better product design and an extension of EPR. Therefore we require a new policy perspective that is consistent, coherent and credible. Overall the realisation of CE requires a better understanding of industrial metabolism through enhanced data, supporting tools, interaction with research, administration and industry and establishing networks for education and training for the CE.

Melanie Haupt from the research organisation ETH based in Zurich, Switzerland tackled the problematic issue of plastics recycling and the implications of the change in the recycling target of the EU under the new CE package. This was instructive because Switzerland has one of the best recycling rates for PET containers in Europe as at present the country has an exemplary record of 82% collection rate. However, if that collected material is then subject to sorting and intermediate processing the recycling rate declines to around 72% but crucially under the new EU measurement requirement it would decline to only 62% of PET available for being reprocessed into new products, both closed loop and other products. Therefore a 90% recycling target for PET single use beverage containers is technically impossible under the EU’s new requirements.

The main omission in the presentations was an absence of a clear theoretical framework for the circular economy, albeit several speakers noted that resource efficiency was the first priority in the move towards establishing a more circular economy globally.",United States,2018.09

 MAUSER Group, a worldwide leading company in industrial packaging, is presenting innovative and sustainable packaging solutions for a circular economy of tomorrow during this year's FachPack. The focus will be on sustainable Intermediate Bulk Containers (IBCs) with barrier properties, plastic drums made of recycled material and a unique load securing system for drums. 

 Bruehl, Germany, September 27, 2018 --(



IBC with barrier properties for a modern circular economy



At the MAUSER booth, a new barrier technology for Composite IBCs will be presented: The MAUSER SkINliner™ IBC protects sensitive filling goods by using an additional inner liner with outstanding barrier properties, which can be adapted to specific customer requirements. The main advantages of the SkINliner™ versus a conventional multilayer IBC are the considerably reduced use of barrier plastic material, close barrier proximity to the filling good and in consequence close to no pollution of the rigid plastic wall of the IBC. The new product was granted all common approvals for the transportation of hazardous goods. The inner liner is to be removed from the IBC easily, the used container is ready for reconditioning and reuse – a superior solution for better recycling and less material to be disposed.



Comprehensive offering of plastic drums made of recycled material for various fields of application



The MAUSER Infinity Series™ plastic drums are made of post-industrial resin, which is manufactured from used industrial packaging in the company’s own state-of-the-art recycling center. MAUSER customers can choose from open head drum design O-Top® with a 30 l to 220 l capacity, and the 220 l capacity tight head drum L-Ring PLUS®, both in mono- or multilayer. Based on the high quality of the recycled material and the manufacturing competence of MAUSER's European sites, the plastic drum series received dangerous goods approvals for Group I solids and Group II liquids. The Infinity series is in high demand because it is more environmentally friendly than plastic drums made from virgin material and has a lower CO2 footprint.



Drumguard® – Safe and sustainable drum loading and transporting



Users of industrial packaging are facing increasing challenges with regard to load securing and sustainability. Often, transport safety is realized by using large quantities of load securing materials. In global goods transport, however, these solutions are not practical for the entire distribution chain, as picking and rearranging of cargo is common. Drumguard® Quattro improves this process by combining economic advantages with a modern, sustainable concept. This unique product enables customers to form loading units by quickly securing drums on pallets in compliance with domestic and international traffic as well as dangerous goods regulations.



Support for the circular economy with the Infinity Series™ inner bottle for IBCs by NCG



The National Container Group is offering sustainable, intelligent and eco-friendly solutions for industrial packaging to its customers on a global level. The services provided include the collection of empty packaging from various manufacturers through the NCG RECOLLECT SYSTEM, the reconditioning of used packaging, the recycling of various material components as well as the delivery of requirements-based packaging solutions for individual customers. With the introduction of an IBC inner bottle made of recycled plastic, customers filling and shipping non-hazardous goods are being offered an exciting alternative for using fewer resources and reducing their CO2 footprints.

38,"In Some Cities People Pay For Bus And Metro Tickets Using Plastic Bottles, Here's How It Works","We live in a world infested with plastic products choking our cities waters and destroying the natural habitat of countless creatures. In a bid to beat this crisis, people have come up with a number of sustainable solutions to reduce the harm it causes.

One of these sustainable solutions is called 'circular economy'. In practice, this concept entails recycling plastic products for simple services like buying bus or metro rail tickets.

The Chairman of Mahindra group, Anand Mahindra, who is an enthusiast of sustainable solutions recently shared a video which talks about four cities that let the public pay for public transport with plastic waste.

The video says that in Beijing commuters to pay for the metro ticket with plastic bottles at a special ticket machine. In an Indonesian city, buses accept payment through plastic bottles and not cash.

In Istanbul people exchange their plastic waste for credit on their metro cards which can be used on different forms of public transport.

In his tweet Mahindra tagged Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Andhra Pradesh CM N. Chandrababu Naidu, asking them whether they would implement this model in Indore and Amravati respectively.

CM Shivraj replied saying while the state of Madhya Pradesh does have several plastic bottle recycling machines, he considered Mahindra's ingenious suggestion.

How cool would it be if we could actually make this work? Think about how much plastic we'd end up recycling and how much money we'd save.",United States,2018.09
39,Emerging economies are rapidly adding to the global pile of garbage,"THE OFFICES OF Miniwiz in central Taipei display all the trappings of a vibrant startup. The large open space on the 14th floor of an office block overlooking Taiwan’s capital is full of hip youngsters huddled around computer screens. A common area downstairs includes a video-game console, a table-tennis table and a basketball hoop. But a hint that this is not just another e-commerce venture comes from neatly sorted sacks packed with old plastic bottles, CDs and cigarette butts.

Rather than peddle brand-new virtual products, Miniwiz derives value from physically repurposing old rubbish. Chairs in the conference room began life as plastic bottles, food packaging, aluminium cans and shoe soles. The translucent walls separating it from executives’ dens owe their amber-like quality to recycled plastic mixed with discarded wheat husks. Coffee is served in glasses made of broken iPhone screens. Arthur Huang, the company’s 40-year-old founder and chief executive, who holds a masters degree in architecture from Harvard, first tried setting up shop in New York in the mid-2000s. That effort failed when he discovered that few Americans shared his obsession with limiting the world’s waste. By contrast, many of his fellow Taiwanese did.

They still do. The island is a poster child for recycling, recovering 52% of rubbish collected from households and commerce, as well as 77% of industrial waste, rivalling rates achieved by South Korea, Germany and other top recycling nations (America recycles 26% and 44% respectively). Its recycling industry brings in annual revenues of more than $2bn. Lee Ying-yuan, the environment minister, boasts that 16 of the 32 teams competing at this year’s football World Cup in Russia sported shirts made in Taiwan from fibres derived from recycled plastic.

For more than two centuries since the start of the Industrial Revolution, Western economies have been built upon the premise of “take, make, dispose”. But the waste this created in 20th-century Europe and America was nothing compared with the rubbish now produced by emerging economies such as China. According to a new World Bank report, in 2016 the world generated 2bn tonnes of municipal solid waste (household and commercial rubbish)—up from 1.8bn tonnes just three years earlier. That equates to 740 grams (1lb 6oz) each day for every man, woman and child on Earth.

That number does not include the much bigger amount produced by industry. Industrial solid refuse contains more valuable materials like scrap metal and has long been better managed by profit-seeking firms. And then there is the biggest waste management problem of all: 30bn tonnes of invisible but dangerous carbon dioxide dumped into the atmosphere every year.

As people grow richer, they consume—and discard—more. Advanced economies make up 16% of the world’s population but produce 34% of its rubbish. The developing world is catching up fast. On current trends, the World Bank projects, by mid-century Europeans and North Americans will produce a quarter more waste than they do today. In the same period, volumes will grow by half in East Asia, they will double in South Asia and triple in sub-Saharan Africa (see map). The annual global total will approach 3.4bn tonnes.

This special report will argue that waste generation is increasing too fast and needs to be decoupled from economic growth and rising living standards. That will require people to throw away less and reuse more—to make economies more “circular”, as campaigners say. This can only happen if people “equate the circular economy with making money”, claims Tom Szaky of Terracycle, which develops technologies to use hard-to-recycle materials. “Take, make, dispose” must now shift to “reduce, reuse, recycle”, he says.

Global waste may not present as apocalyptic a challenge as climate change, but it may be easier to solve. This is because local action to clean it up and recycle it can lead to immediate local effects. That can in turn transform into a virtuous cycle of change. People are more likely to take action if they can quickly see the results of their change in behaviour. All the more so because reducing waste offers two benefits not just one. It not only removes an affliction (solid waste) but, unlike tackling smog, it also creates a tangible benefit at the same time, in the shape of the recycled materials that can be reused. On top of that, solid waste (the only type that this report will discuss) is a visible eyesore. It is hard for anyone to deny that it exists.

That does not mean it will be easy to move to a more circular economy. Currently 37% of solid waste goes to landfill worldwide, 33% to open dumps, 11% to incinerators (see chart). Some goes to compost heaps. Two-thirds of aluminium cans are currently recycled in America, but only 10% of plastic. All told, only 13% of municipal solid waste is recycled globally. Everyone agrees that this is far too little.

The urgency of the problem is not in dispute. In July India’s Supreme Court warned that Delhi, the country’s capital, is buried under “mountain loads of garbage”. When dumps or landfills catch fire, as more than 70 have in Poland over the sweltering summer, noxious smog smothers their surroundings. Toxic runoff can permeate soils and poison waterways. Some rivers in Indonesia are so blanketed with litter that it completely conceals the water beneath. According to the United Nations, diarrhoea rates are twice as high in areas where waste is not collected regularly, and acute respiratory infections are six times as common.

Discharged into seas, rubbish can return to wreak havoc on land. In August the Arabian Sea spewed 12,000 tonnes of debris and litter onto the shores of Mumbai in two days. Or it can despoil the ocean. Fishermen in the Arabian Sea complain they net four times as much plastic as fish. The “great Pacific garbage patch”, an Alaska-sized ocean gyre in the north Pacific Ocean, where currents channel all manner of flotsam, may contain 79,000 tonnes of plastic debris. Greenhouse gases from the waste industry, mainly emitted by a cacophony of chemical reactions in landfills, could account for 8-10% of all climate-cooking emissions by 2025. Left unchecked, this groundswell of garbage risks overwhelming the planet.

The good news is that around the world politicians and the public appear increasingly alert to the economic, ecological and human costs of waste, as well as to the missed opportunities it presents. Many governments in the developing world are grasping that spending less—or nothing—on waste management means paying more for things like health care to treat its effects. In the developing world, only half of all municipal waste is collected. In low-income countries as much as 90% ends up in open dumps. Lowering these proportions requires more investment in waste infrastructure such as managed landfills or low-polluting incinerators. Taiwan’s example shows that these can be clean and need not discourage recycling.

Rich countries already have such facilities, and more. They need to improve the recovery of valuable materials from their waste streams. For two decades they have relied on emerging economies, primarily China, to recycle their refuse. Over the past 25 years, the world deposited 106m tonnes of plastic in Chinese ports for recycling. The system ran aground in January when China banned imports of virtually all plastic and unsorted paper, out of concern for its environment. This left Western waste-managers with tonnes of unwanted rubbish—and left policymakers with piles of unanswered questions about how to boost the capacity of domestic recyclers, and ultimately change citizens’ carefree approach to waste.

Politicians in Europe and American states and cities—if not Donald Trump, America’s distinctly ungreen president—are issuing ambitious recycling targets and trying to revamp the way they manage their rubbish. Techies and entrepreneurs like Mr Huang or Mr Szaky are dreaming up clever—and lucrative—ways to manage and reuse it. Multinationals are toying with resource-light business models based on service contracts rather than product sales. And many consumers are adopting leaner lifestyles.

But municipal budgets are tight everywhere. Trade tiffs can dampen legitimate exchange of scrap (as recycled waste is also known). Regulations for handling waste are necessary but can be obscure. Policymakers have yet to devise a way to boost large-scale investment in recycling, which is discouraged by periodic declines in the cost of primary commodities, with which recyclers compete. And some worry that switching to a more circular economy will harm those built on the old model.

These problems are real. But, as this report will argue, they are not insurmountable. In the 1990s, economic growth, rising living standards and soaring consumption outpaced Taiwan’s capacity to clean up its waste, earning it the unflattering moniker of “garbage island”. As recently as 1993 nearly a third of Taipei’s rubbish was not even formally collected and virtually none was recycled. By 1996 two-thirds of landfills were nearing capacity.

In the face of mounting protests the government undertook to erect 24 incinerator plants to burn the waste instead, at a cost of $2.9bn. It also incentivised the Taiwanese to produce less rubbish in the first place. Under an “extended producer responsibility” (EPR) scheme, manufacturers and brands began to contribute to the cost of their products’ disposal, either through paying a fee into a fund earmarked for waste management or sometimes by managing the waste themselves. The less recyclable the product, the more expensive for the company. The scheme continues today. Households are charged for the amount of general mixed waste they produce but not for paper, glass, aluminium or other recyclables. Those caught dumping their trash illegally face hefty fines and public shaming. A typical Taiwanese person now throws out 850 grams daily, down from 1.15kg 20 years ago.

Half a century after environmentalists first began imploring consumers to reduce, reuse and recycle, similar exhortations are now echoing from San Francisco to Shanghai. And the world, drowning in garbage, has begun to listen.",United States,2018.09
43,Nations commit to fight plastic pollution together during the UN General Assembly,"
• To launch the UN Environment's Global Plastics Platform, UN Environment and the European Commission hosted an event alongside the UN General Assembly.
• The network will encourage new commitments to reduce plastic pollution and,supporting the transition to a more circular economy.

New York, 25 September, 2018 – To build on the growing momentum around the plastics agenda, UN Environment and the European Commission jointly hosted an event at the United Nations HQ today to launch UN Environment's Global Plastics Platform. Member States, businesses, the European Commission and UN Environment showcased their initiatives, learned from each other, and committed to fight plastic pollution together.

The event, hosted on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, offered the opportunity for governments to officially join a 'Race to the Top' through the Global Plastics Platform, a network that will encourage new commitments to reduce plastic pollution and explore innovative ways to change the habits of design, production, consumption and disposal of plastics around the world, supporting the transition to a more circular economy.

Many countries across the world have made ambitious commitments to beat plastics pollution during 2018. On World Environment Day 2018, India announced to ban all single-use plastics by 2022. Plastic bags bans have been announced in Chile, Botswana, and Peru, while Nigeria will set up recycling plants across the country, Brazil will announce a new national plan on plastics and Wales will commit to be the first “refill nation.”

The aim of the Global Plastics Platform is to provide support to countries and cities who made these ambitious commitments, by facilitating the sharing of experiences, the establishment of new policies and inspiration for new commitments.

“The Global Plastics Platform is exactly the kind of initiative we need to bring countries together in the fight against millions of tonnes of plastics that end up in our oceans each year,” Head of UN Environment Erik Solheim said. “No one can solve the problem of plastic pollution alone, but together we will fuel global change.”

European Commission First Vice-President Frans Timmermans said: ""The European Commission has already taken action this year to deal with the plastic items we find most often on our beaches, and to transform the business model of the European plastics industry and reduce economic and industrial waste. But we share responsibility for this planet and its protection with others. A cross-border problem requires multilateral efforts, and that is why I am delighted to partner with UN Environment to tackle the different sources and effects of plastic waste together.""

Head of UN Environment Erik Solheim and First Vice-President of the European Commission Frans Timmermans were joined by renowned marine biologist Sylvia Earle, who underlined the urgent need for bold, decisive action on the plastic pollution that is troubling the world’s oceans.

Government representatives and leaders from the public and private sector got to share their experiences, best practices and concerns around the phasing out or regulation of plastic products at the event, moderated by Editor-in-Chief of National Geographic magazine Susan Goldberg, Goldberg also helped to illustrate the impact of the plastic challenge with original photography and film content first published by National Geographic this year.

The UN Environment Global Plastics Platform will build on and further advance the efforts made by the European Union, the G7, the G20, the UN Environment Assembly and existing initiatives and partnerships, such as the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy, supported by the World Economic Forum, the New Plastics Economy of Ellen MacArthur Foundation, and the work of the Regional Seas Conventions across the world.

UN Environment has played a leading role in positioning plastics pollution at the top of the global agenda, placing the theme at the centre of the world’s attention for World Environment Day 2018. By increasing global awareness and highlighting circular economy as its solution, the issue was propelled it to the top of the agenda for member states, the public and the private sector.

UN Environment is the leading global voice on the environment. It provides leadership and encourages partnership in caring for the environment by inspiring, informing, and enabling nations and peoples to improve their quality of life without compromising that of future generations. UN Environment works with governments, the private sector, the civil society and with other UN entities and international organizations across the world.

47,The Recyclate Initiative - a Best Practice Example at FachPack,"Immo Sander, Head of Packaging Development at Werner & Mertz, highlights the Recycling Initiative's sustainable packaging solutions at Fachpack.

In his keynote address on the second day of the fair, he pointed out the development achievements of the Recyclate Initiative as an example how material cycles can be kept closed and high quality and healthy secondary materials from plastics packaging can be used.

Plastic packaging faces up to increasing criticism. The new German packaging law, the European Union's circular economy package, and not least of all, consumer pressure are prompting manufacturers to rethink and optimize the design of plastic packaging, so that the plastic can be reused. Since 2012, the Recyclate Initiative has promoted the idea that plastic is a valuable material which must be used over and over in a circular economy.

Instead of the usual linear use of raw materials (cradle to grave), the Initiative pursues circular use of raw material in keeping with the Cradle-to-Cradle© principle. It conserves valuable resources and also protects the environment. To that end, the material for packaging and the cleaning solution from Werner & Mertz are returned again and again to a closed system.

With the Recyclate Initiative's successful developments, Sander showed that it is possible to establish a functioning material cycle for plastic along the entire supply chain with constructive cooperation from everybody involved. In recent years, the Recyclate Initiative has demonstrated how previously untapped sources of secondary material like the Yellow Bag, used to collect waste to be recycled in Germany, can be used for material recycling.

""In collaboration with our partners, we have proven that it is possible to develop bottles and caps made of 100% recycled PET, HDPE and PP,"" Mr. Sander says.

The Recyclate Initiative's portfolio of innovations includes the development of Frosch bottles of 100% recycled PET, and the world's first rHDPE packaging and rPP caps - both of 100% consumer plastic from the Yellow Bag.

The newest development is a completely recyclable standing pouch and the development of cradle-to-cradle certified masterbatches for coloured caps, sustainable printing inks and recycling-optimized labelling solutions.

""The recyclability of packaging has to be taken into consideration in the packaging design. 'Healthy' materials, i.e. plastics sorted according to origin, and environmentally compatible ingredients, are absolute prerequisites for a functioning circular economy, as is the recyclability of packaging after its usage phase,"" says Mr. Sander.

""The recyclability of plastic is first made possible with the manufacture of sortable plastic packaging. The design for recycling includes the design of (recycled) plastic that can be sorted by origin, sustainable masterbatches, printing inks and removable labels. When packaging is designed to be recyclable, it is easier to separate different types of plastic cleanly and then offer a truly reusable material to the recycling industry.""

Werner & Mertz recently cooperated with Mondi to create a fully recyclable standing pouch of polyethylene with a removable label, designed according to cradle-to-cradle© principles.

""With this groundbreaking design for recycling, we have taken a giant step for closed-loop circulation of plastic packaging. The patented standing pouch will be used as flexible packaging for Frosch products, starting in 2019. After use the pouch can be recycled 100% into a recyclate of nearly the same quality as the source material.",United States,2018.09

53,"Launches 3600, Starting the Development Process For the First Standard to Help Companies Evaluate Circular Economy Efforts","UL 3600 Measures Circular Economy Efforts at the Site, Product and Company Level

MARIETTA, GA., September 25, 2018 — UL today introduced UL 3600, the certification document for Measuring and Reporting Circular Economy Aspects of Products, Sites and Organizations. Following a standards development process with stakeholders, UL 3600 will be the first standard that evaluates the circularity of companies’ material flows. Circular Economy is widely seen as an important aspect of company sustainability efforts because these initiatives can help companies continue to grow, while managing resource scarcity, supply chain volatility and changing global regulations. Companies can begin certifying to UL 3600 now.

UL 3600 helps address an urgent need for methods to measure circularity progress in light of global megatrends – including climate change, resource constraints, and bioaccumulation of toxic chemicals – that are already having significant impacts on human and ecosystem health. The certification document provides the foundation of UL’s Circularity Facts™ Program, through which UL evaluates a company’s efforts to move from a linear economy mindset to a more sustainable, circular approach that eliminates waste and keeps materials in productive use longer. Through the program, UL is able to report on several aspects of sustainability, including the use of recycled content (such as closed-loop recycled content), bio-based content, recyclability, waste minimization and zero waste to landfill.

Companies that pursue certification to UL 3600 will have their material flows evaluated across three dimensions— product, facility, and enterprise— and the results will be reported in a Circularity Facts™ Report. The report serves as a transparency tool that shows a visual representation of a company’s circularity efforts, and it can grow with a company as it expands the scope of its own circularity thinking and program.

“UL is pleased to introduce the world’s first certification to measure a company’s Circular Economy initiatives,” said Alberto Uggetti, vice president and general manager for UL’s Environment division. “Global issues such as supply chain constraints, recent restrictions on recycling imports and resource scarcity are pushing Circular Economy thinking to the forefront for many companies, and UL offers a way to track and measure progress on these initiatives, and communicate them to the marketplace in a transparent way.”

UL’s William F. Hoffman III, Ph.D., UL Corporate Fellow and senior scientist, and primary author of the UL 3600 Standard, will speak on the topic of Circular Economy at the upcoming VERGE 18 conference in Oakland Ca. on a panel entitled “Meaningful Metrics for New Models” on Wednesday, October 17th.

54,Our top 10 clean economy and climate change stories of 2018 | Greenbiz,"2018 has been a landmark year for champions of sustainable business. Looking back reveals the biggest news events and most influential topics of the past year, as well as what resonates the most with you, the GreenBiz readership.

Among the takeaways from the GreenBiz.com site traffic patterns: 2018 was a year in which we collectively not only paid attention to plastic waste but called for solutions; we craved more information about which people and which companies were leading the transition to clean energy and a circular economy; and more of us seemed determined to tackle food waste, from the table to the market.

Check out, or rediscover, the news or commentary that you might have missed from our analysts, editors and the GreenBiz community — with this list of 10 of GreenBiz's most widely read stories and reports from the past 12 months.

And as we look ahead into 2019, is there any coverage you want to see more or less of in the upcoming year? Feel free to shoot us an email at [email protected] with any and all feedback.

1. Solving for global plastic waste is a massive undertaking. Here are a few ways we can try.

Single-use plastic packaging, bottles and bags. A lack of recycling infrastructure and consumer incentives to use what is there. A manufacturing system in which creating plastic that won't degrade for thousands of years is cheaper than reusing the mountains and oceans of waste that already has been produced.

And this year, countless brands, governments, NGOs and celebrities calling for structural change.

Readers were drawn in droves this year to an article by Circulate Editor-in-chief Joe Iles about the innovative winners of the New Plastics Economy Innovation Prize, launched in 2017 by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. They proposed solutions that ranged from reusing food waste to create plastic to improving the performance of bio-based and biodegradable packaging. The ultimate goal? Moving past the ""take, make, dispose"" culture to a circular economy.

2. The energy landscape is shifting — fast. In 2017, coal looked like it was going the way of the horse and buggy; in 2018, natural gas looked like it might be next.

At the beginning of 2018, California Clean Energy Fund's (CEF) managing director, Danny Kennedy, predicted that the end of natural gas was near. 



Why? The signals from 2017 were big and bold: The November prior, Siemens and General Electric shuttered much of their gas turbine-making capacities. Siemens, the European manufacturing giant, reported that it could make 400 100-megawatt gas turbines annually but had received orders only for 110, while GE laid off 20,000 workers in its gas-related business.



""A fully renewable energy supply and the electrification of everything is the emerging plan in California, wherein electric vehicles are a distributed asset and thermal power is dying,"" Kennedy writes.

Did his forecast prove correct? Still TBD, but 2018 certainly has shown the urgency of the transition to clean energy. And as more states scrutinize the environmental impact of methane, a gas commonly leaked by the natural gas production and distribution system, there's more pressure to more closely meter the natural gas revolution.

3. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation (the circular economy visionary NGO) launched its widely anticipated New Plastics Economy Global Commitment. GreenBiz was among the first with the story.

Our third most popular article of 2018 was about the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's new plastic paradigm-shifting commitments. On Oct. 28, when ""more than 275 brands, retailers, recyclers, governments and NGOs [announced] a shared vision to close the loop on plastic pollution ... pledged to eradicate plastic waste and pollution,"" the GreenBiz circular economy senior analyst, Lauren Phipps, synthesized the details and analyzed the potential impact.

""The global commitment offers a promising vision for eliminating plastic waste and transforming an aspirational circular economy for plastics into a functioning, closed-loop system,"" Phipps writes. ""But while the hundreds of signatories represent producers and consumers of a fifth of the plastics market, it will require participation by the other 80 percent to truly turn the tide on plastic pollution.""

5. SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket launched into space, taking a Tesla Roadster along for the ride. Our columnist didn't think it was so cool.

If 2018 has shown us anything, it's that Elon Musk is no stranger to publicity stunts. Why is it that everything he does garners an inordinate amount of press, including from us?

His launch of a SpaceX around the beginning of this year ""undoubtedly will go down as one of the great advertising coups of the early 21st century,"" writes Alan AtKisson, sustainability stalwart and senior official in the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency.

""Frontier economics, politics and cultural grandstanding are already taking hold,"" he warns.

6. The age-old question: What's the ROI on an advanced sustainability degree?



Clearly, the sustainable business crowd cares about investing in the future. How about their own futures? MBAs with sustainable concentrations, frequently called ""green MBAs,"" focus on the intersection of ethics, success and sustainability all together.

Still, for any higher degree, there's a price tag and a time commitment. There are countless paths to personal and professional success. One of our writers talked to green MBA candidates and other sustainability career-people to learn about theirs and figure out if the programs are worth it.

8. The world is drowning in plastic pollution, but it seems that the public finally feels the crisis. A deeper dive into how we got here.



David Attenborough. A straw in a sea turtle’s nose. What moved the massive public awareness of plastic waste?

Not one thing, really, argues our editor-in-chief, Joel Makower. ""There’s been no single, catalytic moment. Rather, the momentum seems largely self-generated, the result of a confluence of events and long-term trends.""

In the first part of a two-part series, Makower explores the who, what, why and how of 2018's sweeping anti-plastics movement.

9. We launched our inaugural VERGE Vanguard Award winners, nominated by the VERGE community and selected by the GreenBiz editorial team across three areas: clean energy; sustainable transportation and mobility; and the circular economy.

Here's to the visionaries, network builders, corporate leaders and innovators.

Ahead of our annual VERGE 18 conference, we announced 20 VERGE Vanguard Award winners, who represent the opportunities that exist around the globe for healthier, prosperous and sustainable communities in solving some of the planet's most pressing social and environmental challenges.

From Google's regenerative designer, Kate Brandt, to urban transportation innovator Robin Chase, to the ringleader of renewable energy buyers, Bill Weihl, these leaders represent the full spectrum of the promise of the clean economy.

10. Across the table, fighting food waste is seen as an essential ingredient in changing the recipe for two major global issues: climate change and world hunger. Here's how companies are altering their diets.

All of the food wasted globally on an annual basis — an estimated 1.6 billion tons — would create a mass 10 times the size of Manhattan, according to an analysis by the Boston Consulting Group.

But solutions abound across the food value chain. Improving measurements, packaging and redistribution are all meaningful actions that agribusinesses, retailers and technology companies are already taking.

Our editorial director, Heather Clancy, explores the scope of the issue and the specifics of the solutions that innovative food waste leaders Chipotle, MGM and Microsoft are working on, among others, from Campbell Soup to Danone to Sodexo to Tesco.

""Changing consumer behavior and cultural expectations is the biggest challenge with all of this,"" Alexandria Coari, director of capital and innovation for ReFED, a multi-stakeholder coalition working on this issue, told her.

55,"Experts seek paradigm shift on sanitation, urge collaboration","Leading the call in Abuja, a former registrar of Environmental Health Registration Council of Nigeria, (EHRCN) Dr. Augustine Ebisike, such reform if strategically put in place, would change the situation for the better.



In a related development, environmentalists have urged government to encourage both private and public sector to set up recycling plants to scale up waste collection/buy back and reuse in the country.

 

 They maintained that targets should be set for decent work and economic growth, which are strongly related to the achievement of a circular economy and sustainable development goals, SDGs.

 

 The experts spoke at Stakeholders’ Summit organised by National Environmental Standards Regulation and Enforcement Agency, NESREA, and sponsored by Food and Beverage Industry in Abuja.

 

 President of Waste Management Society of Nigeria,(WAMASON), Prof. Oladele Osibanjo, said this could be achieved through long-lasting design, maintenance, repair, and treating of waste after it has occurred. He explained that circular economy is a regenerative system in which resource input and waste, emission, and energy leakage are minimized by slowing, closing, and narrowing energy and material loops.

On his part, vice chairman of Food and Beverage Recycling Alliance (FBRA) , Adekunle Olusuyi, said tthey alliance have been intensifying awareness on separation of waste and environmental pollution.

Contributing, Chairman of FBRA , Sade Morgan said that with estimated annual growth rate of 2.6 percent in Nigeria, there was increase in level of consumption, translating to rise in waste generation that needs to be tackled.

 

 Ola Oressanya of E-Waste Producer Responsibility organization of Nigeria, opined that implementing circular economy in electrical and electronic equipment, would go along way to control waste here.He explained that development of database on e-waste generation and recycling would sustain environmentally sound and eliminate pollution resulting from informal methods of management.",United States,2018.12
56,"Slurry is future of energy here, say ministers","Using slurry to power family homes is the future of energy production in Ireland, ministers believe.

The Government is now pushing to roll out a new national network to harness power from agricultural waste as the country comes under pressure to reduce its carbon emissions.

A recent report from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland highlights the potential of harnessing gas from slurry and silage. They found that biogas or biomethane could potentially contribute to 28% of our gas supply by 2025, and by 2050, half of all supply could be produced in this way.

Anaerobic digesters can harness gas produced by cattle, pigs and sheep and are already widely used in other European countries.

The departments of Agriculture and Climate Action are now working to encourage farmers to install these green energy suppliers on their farms.

Agriculture Minister Michael Creed said that the potential for growth in the sector is strong and it could create thousands of jobs in Ireland, but he conceded that it is still at a nascent stage of development when compared to other countries.

There are just 31 biogas plants in Ireland, with 10 biogas plants using animal-by-products (ABPs). This compares to around 9,000 anaerobic digester plants in Germany and 1,900 in Italy.

Mr Creed said: “The benefits of anaerobic digestion are well documented. A key benefit of reducing greenhouse gas emissions is by displacement of use of fossil fuels.

“Wider environmental benefits include effective slurry management, water quality improvements, improved soil nutrient management, and reduction in odours from slurry spreading.

“There are also positive economic impacts both to the farmer as well as the wider rural community in terms of an additional income stream for farmers and job creation in rural locations,” he said.

However, Mr Creed said the cost of setting up and operating anaerobic digesters can be prohibitive to farmers and there are difficulties in securing traditional forms of financial support because of the length of return on investment.

In November, Climate Action and Environment Minister Richard Bruton announced seven successful projects under the Climate Action Fund.

They included the awarding of €8.5m to Gas Networks Ireland for the development of a Graze project in Mitchelstown, Co Cork.

It is the first of 17 similar projects due to be rolled out across the country to produce sufficient biogas to power 56,000 homes by mixing silage and slurry using on-farm anaerobic digestion.

The North Cork town was chosen as the location for the pilot project due to the high number of cattle in the area and its close proximity to the country’s biggest gas line.

“The development of anaerobic digestion facilities to produce biogas for use in heating or biomethane for injection into the gas grid has a key role to play in Ireland’s transition to a low carbon future,” a spokesperson for Mr Bruton said.

“This project involves the installation of a central grid injection facility for renewable gas, a renewable gas logistics operation, two compressed natural gas (CNG) stations, and a grant scheme to support around 74 CNG vehicles.

“The approval by the minister of this project, which will be the second grid injection point in Ireland, demonstrates a strong commitment to supporting the production of biomethane from waste using anaerobic digestion.”

Minister of state Sean Canney said such energy-saving measures would help the economy of rural Ireland and said farming groups are supportive of the idea.

“I met with farmers in Ballinasloe recently and they were talking about anaerobic digesters and creating what I call ‘group energy’ similar to the group water schemes.

“By doing that, you are creating a circular economy, the waste that you have from farms is being used to create energy.”",United States,2018.12
57,Palm to build fibre separation plant at King's Lynn,"A fibre separation plant is to be built by Palm Paper alongside its paper mill in King’s Lynn which recycles 500,000 tonnes of fibre per year into newsprint and associated grades.

The significant investment in the separation plant will see separately collected mixed papers targeted by the company for sorting these primarily into newspaper and magazines, which will be used within the mill’s process, and cardboard which will be despatched for recycling by UK or European board mills.

Palm Recycling, which is Palm Paper’s in-house supply business, will be sourcing some 200,000 tonnes per annum of material from local authorities and waste management companies for sorting.

The investment decision is seen as confirming Palm Paper’s commitment to its Norfolk mill as well as providing increased storage on site.

However, the decision is also seen as confirming that the mill needs to protect itself by ensuring that it receives sufficient newspapers at the right quality for recycling as it could lose out if more newspapers are sold within volumes of mixed paper for use by cardboard mills.

Palm Recycling has emphasised that it is not building a materials recycling facility and will only handle fibre that is separately collected from glass, cans and plastics. “We are seeking to sort out soft mixed paper with a high deinking content, and separate out card for mills that want the material,” said Palm Recycling’s managing director, Gero Hempel.

He explained that Palm is looking to work with councils and contractors to ensure high quality recycling. And, Mr Hempel added. “Markets have changed with the developments in China, and Palm believes that this facility will provide a sustainable outlet for separately collected fibres.”

Sarah Raymond, national account and development manager for Palm Recycling, said that while she accepted there are a lot of factors for local authorities to consider in adopting a fibre separate collection, “Palm does believe there are financial benefits in the separate collection of fibre by local authorities and waste management companies for further sorting”.

Ms Raymond said that she expected more local authorities to assess the option to move to dual stream collection, especially in the light of the recent Waste and Resources Strategy which indicates a desire for quality in the recycling stream and building long term sustainable outlets.

Mr Hempel explained: “We want to make a high quality of newspaper and the best way for us to receive good quality recycled feedstock is the separate collection of paper.”

Construction of the modular sorting plant has started with completion due in the third quarter of 2019. Capacity at start-up will be around 60,000 tonnes per annum moving towards 210,000 tonnes per annum at full operational level.

Equipment will be supplied by Bavaria Entsorgungstechnik while groundworks have been started by Mick George for contractor Brooks and Wood Ltd.

Palm has extensive experience in sorting mixed papers and King’s Lynn will draw on some of its parent company’s knowledge in Germany where an estimated two million tonnes of fibre sorting takes place because residents have a separately collected blue bin for paper.

Palm believes that on a broader European scale, the development at King’s Lynn will support the Circular Economy Package which has been adopted by the UK.",United States,2018.12
59,Toronto the first city in Canada to join Global Circular Economy Network!,"Toronto the first city in Canada to join Global Circular Economy Network!

Toronto is the first city in Canada to join the Circular Economy 100 (CE100) network, which focuses on reducing waste and getting the most value out of products and resources.

“We are proud to join this global network of government and corporate entities working to drive economic prosperity and improve the environment,” said Mayor John Tory. “Toronto remains committed to reaching its climate action goals, while creating a liveable and sustainable tomorrow.”

As part of the Long Term Waste Management Strategy, approved by Council in 2016, the City is working toward a goal of zero waste and developing a policy framework to make Toronto the first municipality in Ontario with a circular economy.

With its membership in the CE100, Toronto now joins leading governments transitioning toward a circular economy, including Brussels, Denmark, London and Phoenix.

60,3 Trends That Will Shape Food Products In 2019,"Forecasting food trends can sometimes be a dicey business, as consumers’ fickle palates (not to mention supply and demand) can be hard to predict. Nonetheless, this time of year brings a flurry of trend reports, from manufacturing and grocery stores to high end dining elements.

One of the earliest reports typically comes from research company Mintel, who recently released its Global Food and Drink Trends 2019 report.

Sustainability, no longer a buzzword and instead a necessity, is pushing further along the supply chain, according to Mintel. “The 360-degree approach reflects the principles of a circular economy, where resources are kept in use for as long as possible, extracting the maximum value while in use and then recovering materials at the end of use,” writes Jenny Zegler, associate director, Mintel Food & Drink. We’ve already seen previous moves to alternatives for plastic straws in the foodservice segment earlier this year — a shift that seems to be gaining traction in the long term as consumers eschew plastic for paper or even metal straws (or, heaven forfend, go straw-free when drinking an adult beverage). The waste-not aesthetic has even entered the brewing world, with beers made from bread and, in some cases, recycled water, to raise customer awareness of unnecessary use of resources.

Mintel points to consumer education as key to continuing to move the needle on sustainability. According to its research, 53 per cent of US consumers agree plant-based foods are better for the environment than animal-based options. The desire to try meat-free products in quick service restaurants can be seen in the popularity of A&W’s Beyond Meat burger — marketed heavily by the chain in Canada as a seamless substitution for carnivores — or the rise of such products on the manufacturing side.

With all the attention on the millennial market in recent years, manufacturers are now turning their attention to another lucrative area — the health halo in the senior segment, already being targeted by the cosmetics industry. “The world’s seniors are a demographic that has immediate need for food and drink that address the effects of ageing. At a time when record numbers of people are living to be 100 years old, food and drink companies are challenged to address the wide variety of health states of consumers aged 55 and older,” writes Zegler. These products can range from the addition of vitamins and supplements to products such as dairy to borrowing functional ingredients from international cultures including ginger and green tea.

Any Way You Want It

Food trends may come and go, but convenience remains key with consumers. According to Mintel, 27 per cent of US consumers surveyed thought that healthy food takes too much time to prepare — and the food manufacturing industry is more than willing to step in. As grocery delivery, meal kits and increasingly sophisticated hot counters continue to blur the definition of a traditional supermarket, today’s diner is used to a landscape that is tailored to their needs, regardless of the time of day. Mintel sees future movement in this segment occurring in three ways: more consumers craving this convenience and driving demand in these products, increased sophistication in the home meal replacement (HMR) products and innovations in technology bringing alternate forms of shopping such as automated convenience stores and mobile options (and who knows, perhaps even a meat vending machine or two).",United States,2018.12

69,These 3 big circular economy stories of 2018 offer hope for 2019 | Greenbiz,"This article is drawn from the Circular Weekly newsletter from GreenBiz, running Fridays.

It’s been quite a year for the circular economy, which has started to move from the margins to the mainstream, and stakeholders representing each link of the value chain are not only taking note but taking action. At least a little bit.

It’s impossible to avoid bad news these days. But the progress I’ve seen on circularity in 2018 leaves me on a hopeful note. So, before we jump into a new year, let’s revisit three of my favorite circular economy stories from the year.

1. Big companies began to align on and commit to confronting plastics pollution. Public awareness of — and outrage against — plastics pollution grew significantly in 2018, quickly elevating the conversation around single-use plastics on a global scale. And that was just the start. (If you need a refresher on the fundamentals of the war on plastics, I encourage you to revisit Joel Makower’s two-part series on the global plastics problem and potential solutions.)

In November, more than 275 brands, retailers, recyclers, governments and NGOs announced a shared vision to close the loop on plastics pollution and made tangible, time-bound commitments to ground aspiration in action. Signatories of the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment — collectively responsible for producing 20 percent of all plastic packaging globally — formally endorsed the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s framework of a circular economy for plastics.

The progress I’ve seen on circularity in 2018 leaves me on a hopeful note. Time will tell if and how signatories achieve these ambitious goals, as well as what will happen if they don’t meet the 2025 target. Still, the global commitment offers a welcome, promising vision for eliminating plastic waste and transforming an aspirational circular economy for plastics into a functioning, closed-loop system.

2. Apparel brands experimented with recommerce. In October, the world's largest online thrift store, thredUP, announced a program to partner with apparel companies on its secondhand retail platform. While nothing is inherently new about selling used clothes, the announcement highlights a growing trend within the apparel industry: turning to third-party recommerce partners to tap into secondary markets.

Resale apparel — a $20 billion industry — is projected to grow 15 percent annually over the next five years, significantly outpacing traditional retail, with only 2 percent projected annual growth, according to thredUp's 2018 Resale Report.

Third parties offer brands the logistics, renewal, repair and recommerce expertise to quickly ramp up resale models at scale, unlocking a low-risk, high-reward market for their goods and offering a straightforward path into a more circular business model. Given that secondhand clothing sales exist regardless of whether brands approve, the opportunity is obvious: Brands can make a margin on selling the same garment multiple times while maintaining brand and quality control.

Yerdle Recommerce’s ""white label"" service for companies such as Eileen Fisher, Patagonia and REI; The Renewal Workshop’s partnership with North Face, prAna and icebreaker; and The RealReal’s collaboration with Stella McCartney are just a few examples that picked up speed in 2018.

While only a handful of companies embrace recommerce so far, given the significant environmental impact of fashion in general, and fast fashion in particular, the environmental implications of even an incremental increase in apparel reuse would be significant.

3. Repair inched towards commercial viability. Product repair and life extension is a bit of an ugly stepsister for circularity in consumer electronics. While independent repair is common within categories such as home appliance and automobiles, it is actively thwarted in some consumer electronics segments.

It’s no secret that manufacturers have an incentive to push new products rather than prolonging the life of existing ones. Some OEMs have more innocent approaches such as upgrade programs, complex product design or proprietary repair tools. Others employ more aggressive tactics such as criminalizing and voiding warranties when unauthorized individuals make repairs, and more questionably, actively lobbying against legislation that might increase product reparability. But some companies are beginning to rethink this linear model.

In October, telecommunications company Motorola began selling replacement parts, tools and instructions directly to customers for all of its recent phones. In a partnership with iFixit, a wiki-based site that teaches people how to fix almost anything, Motorola’s new repair product line was seen as a big win for the ""right to repair"" movement that asserts companies should be legally obligated to offer the tools, parts, schematics and diagnostics necessary to fix things that customers own. While customers may buy products with less frequency, Motorola is betting that increased repair options will build brand loyalty.",United States,2018.12

71,Blockchain Company Highlights Circular Economy,"A Netherlands-based blockchain startup company is changing the course of data sharing, certification access, as well as product and material oversight. Circularise offers a communication system that companies can use for “virtually endless range of product value chains” according to a release from the company.

In early December, the company put the circular economy in the spotlight, showing the overall benefits it provides to the industry. The concept focuses on reusing resources and maximizing the value of all products and materials. The end result is the elimination of waste.

Through the communication technology provided by the company, stakeholders are enabled to share information about parts, materials, etc. while maintaining ownership of their data and determining who gets access to it.

“Providing a system where all stakeholders can be held accountable for their actions, audit results can be published and shared, and information can be exchanged in a flexible way, is key,” explained Pietro Pasotti of Circularise.

The company revealed successful pilot programs with an Italian recycling plant as well as Netherlands-based furniture manufacturer and plans to expand its reach in 2019 in the fashion/textile and beverage industries through additional project initiatives. Circularise has also had successful partnerships with over 18 organizations.

Since 2017 Circularise is working with multiple partners in the framework of H2020 C-SERVEES project backed by the European Union. Together these parties are developing a solution that aims to boost a resource-efficient circular economy in the electrical and electronic (E&E) sector through the potential synergies of two major revolutions of our time: the circular economy and the Industry 4.0.",United States,2018.12
72,CPG Companies Encountered Big Forces Of Change In 2018,"The consumer packaged-goods industry remained in the midst of a revolution in 2018 as companies big and small, legacy and startup enterprises alike, responded to changes in consumer demand and preferences, as well as to technological disruption and new business imperatives.

Here are 10 stories and trends that defined 2018 for the CPG industry and will to influence heavily how 2019 unfolds:

Rebooting at the top: The unprecedented forces of change in the CPG industry continued to put CEOs in the hot seat — or out the door. Emblematic of the pressures was the ouster of Campbell Soup CEO Denise Morrison and the subsequent dismantling of her attempts to build a fresh-food empire before the company hired processed-foods veteran Mark Clouse as its new CEO in December. On the other hand, the exit of long-time PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi drew kudos for her ability to walk the company into the better-for-you era.

Raising prices: The strong U.S. economy, employment levels and income increases finally afforded CPG companies some latitude to raise prices broadly after many years of fighting a “new normal” of sluggish top-line movement. At the same time, brands were conscious to ad innovations such as new sizes and flavors to provide extra value to consumers along with higher price tags.

Stripping labels: CPG brands kept removing ingredients — especially artificial ones — from their formulations in efforts to provide consumers with the “cleanest” labels possible, in large part a play for millennial moms who’ve become missional about feeding their kids only pristine foods and beverages.

Sniffing marijuana: The rapid mainstreaming of legal cannabis consumption took root in the CPG industry with news of Canadian distiller Constellation’s investment in a marijuana company and of Coca-Cola’s investigating its own possibilities for beverages based on CBD, the non-psychoactive component of marijuana.

Growing plant proteins: Plant-based “meats,” “milks” and other analogs for animal proteins kept booming, with CPG giants expanding their plant-based offerings, while accomplished startups were cashing in, such as Beyond Meat, which filed for a $100-million IPO.

Going private: Supermarkets’ private labels continued to take share from established CPG suppliers as store brands broadened their appeal with more organic and frozen selections, among other extensions, and by positioning their own lines as on-trend with millennial consumers who care about price and quality over fancy branding.

Rejiggering delivery: Food-delivery startups continued to proliferate, and grocery chains came up with more delivery options for their consumers, including at home and curbside at the store. But some early home-delivery pioneers such as Blue Apron and Chef’d struggled with customer defections and consumers’ rethinking of the subscription model for mealtime.

Learning big-to-small: Nearly every CPG worth its salt now either has acquired smaller companies in better-for-you categories or has launched incubator or accelerator programs that are helping the big companies learn about ingredient innovation, digital marketing and other new-age pursuits from the fast-growing small fry – and also giving the big companies leads on potential acquisitions.

Focusing on food waste: PepsiCo’s decision to acquire SodaStream for $3.2 billion underscored the slow abandonment of the carbonated soft-drink platform by beverage giants — but also was the most telling sign yet that big CPG companies are buying into the notion of a growing “circular economy” in which consumers hope to cut food waste and use of plastic packaging.

Thawing frozen foods: A surprising uptick in sales of frozen foods over the last couple of years has given legacy CPG companies an unexpected avenue to pursue millennial consumers in categories they understand well. ConAgra’s big $10.9-billion purchase of frozen-foods giant Pinnacle Foods underscores the rise of this strategy, though it now appears that ConAgra overestimated the immediate benefits of its acquisition.",United States,2018.12
75,Coca Cola recycling investment extends loan for PET recycling tech,"The Coca-Cola Company announces new agreement that extends its loan to Ioniq Technologies.

The Netherlands-based Ioniq Technologies is an important part of Coca Cola recycling endeavors. The company has developed a proprietary technology to produce high-grade, recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Coca Cola wants to use this technology to boost the amount of recycled material in its bottles.

Coca Cola says its investment supports the company’s goal to create packaging made of at least 50% recycled material by 2030.

The company’s global vision is to work toward a “World Without Waste.” Part of this vision includes meeting its 2030 goal of creating packaging that is composed of a minimum of 50% recycled material.

At present, PET is used on a broad scale to produce plastic packaging. That said, it is difficult to recycle, with only 20% of the material being recyclable. The remaining 80% is incinerated, winds up in landfills, or leaks into the natural environment.

Ioniqa’s proprietary technology can covert waste containing PET into purified polymer building blocks that can be reformed into high-quality PET. This new technology supports the circular economy for plastics by making it so packages, such as colored PET bottles that may have been excluded from certain recycling streams, can be recycled into food-grate quality packages instead of ending up in landfills.

The new coca cola recycling agreement with Ioniqa is designed to accelerate the development and deployment of the recycling tech.

The new Coca Cola recycling technology investment will help work toward creating a circular economy for PET.

“Our investment in new and pioneering recycling technologies is an opportunity or significant movement toward closing the loop and creating a circular economy for PET,” says Robert Long, the chief innovation officer for Coca-Cola, reported Recycling Today.

“We plan to continue investment in developing the right partnerships and initiatives – like with Ioniqa – to support our vision of a World Without Waste.”

Senior director of Global R&D Engineering for the Coca-Cola Company, Scott Pearson, said that enhanced recycling is one of the technologies needed to drive a circular economy. Pearson added that while it’s the next big step, “It’s not the only step.” Minimizing the use of virgin plastics and making packaging as lightweight as possible by using as little material as possible is also an important part of coca cola recycling efforts.",United States,2018.12

77,"The Circular Economy: Enabling Sustainability, for Business and Planet","
• With a finite amount of resources available to us, it’s essential for both individuals and businesses to make a greater commitment to sustainability
• By addressing the full product lifecycle, companies can help reach the ultimate goal of net-zero environmental impact

CSO Chris Wellise explores how looking at the entire product lifecycle can help businesses achieve a more sustainable future

We have just one Earth.

But at our current rate of consumption, we need about 1.7 Earths in order to provide all of the resources we expend on an annual basis.

Given the challenges our planet faces today due to energy and resource consumption, further exacerbated by population growth, the concept of sustainability – in order to truly live up to its name – must be more comprehensive than perfunctory efforts. Indeed, we must bend the curve from a take-make-dispose model to a regenerative and restorative system that eliminates waste through the superior design of materials, products, and business models.

That approach is the foundation for the Circular Economy, a sustainability paradigm with the ultimate goal of creating net-zero impact by addressing every phase of the product lifecycle: from resource extraction to product design and use, through to end-of-use management.

When Circular Economy principles are embraced, it’s good for both business and our planet. While environmental disruption creates vulnerabilities from material scarcity or fluctuating commodity prices; actively managing our consumption creates infrastructure efficiencies, opportunities for innovation, and business resilience. We fully believe that at HPE– as we announced today with the release of our new Circular Economy Report – we can help organizations drive financial and business results with efficient solutions that maximize material, resource, and equipment efficiencies for IT infrastructure.

At HPE, we are following Circular Economy principles as we innovate the IT infrastructure of the future, not simply because of the environmental and societal benefits but because it is a strong driver for economic growth.

As we indicate in the Circular Economy Report, which is available to HPE Financial Services Lease Return and Asset Upcycling Services customers, HPE is able to provide IT and sustainability organizations with information about the carbon, energy, material, and landfill savings achieved by returning retired or end-of-use assets to us for processing through HPE Technology Renewal Centers.

Specifically, the report, based on sophistical life-cycle-analysis and economic assessment, shows a breakdown by category of the IT products that were refurbished, remarketed and reintroduced into the economy as products, and those that were recycled and put back into the economy as recycled materials.

This is important information for organizations to share, especially as investors and customers increasingly request the disclosure of a company’s environmental impacts. But even more important than the information is the message behind it:

That we have the capability to find new ways to manage the explosive demand for data by using far less space, materials, and energy.

We have an opportunity to use the power of technology and our position as a global company to enable our customers to transition to a more Circular Economy. Although the concept is not a new one, we are at an inflection point today as companies accelerate their digital transformations and ditch legacy hardware for new solutions.

HPE is taking the initiative to help our customers optimize their IT infrastructure by leveraging our global expertise to drive more efficient use of energy, materials, and resources. That means innovating IT solutions that reduce total cost of ownership and meet tightening regulations around the world, as well as putting used equipment with value back into the economy. In this way, our Circular Economy approach connects the goals of IT organizations and corporate sustainability strategies – meeting and exceeding the expectations of customers.

We have many ways of helping customers do just that – from our Design for Environment program, to Asset Upcycling Services, to consumption models that shift ownership away from the customer, leading to higher rates of efficiency and reuse. And we know that customers are demanding this: HPE’s Technology Renewal Centers processed 58 million pounds of equipment in FY18, while HPE GreenLake pay-per-use solution now has more than US $2 billion in total contract value.

The Circular Economy isn’t academic theory. It’s a pragmatic plan of action that encompasses the entire product lifecycle, while maximizing the greatest value to both business and environment.

80,Top 5 NLC Reports from 2018,"What did city leaders want to learn about most this year? The numbers don’t lie: autonomous vehicles, recycling, small cell deployment, the census and local trends.

At the National League of Cities, we are dedicated to ensuring that cities are able to thrive and stay abreast of emerging issues in an ever-changing national landscape. And as we approach the holidays, we are grateful for your support and the ability to serve thousands of cities every year.

We have an exciting 2019 to look forward to, but we wanted to take the time to share our top five most popular guides and reports from 2018. You can read the descriptions below, and be sure to check out any reports you missed earlier this year. Links are in the titles.

It’s no wonder thousands of people visited this microsite in its first month — it’s all about robots.

Today in America, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are already on our streets, with pilots taking place in cities nationwide. Technology like this can be utilized to make all of our lives better — but even if our hands are off the wheel, we must drive this future together.

That’s why NLC and the Bloomberg Aspen Initiative on Cities and Autonomous Vehicles collaborated on this resource, which includes a primer, atlas, a series of reports and four stores of how this technology could shape cities’ futures.

A linear economy’s model is “take, make, waste.” A circular economy connects the two ends of the cycle, using waste as a feedstock for production. Zero waste, or using waste from one process as a resource for others, and separating material consumption from economic growth will preserve resources, create jobs, add economic value, minimize waste and curb greenhouse emissions.

That’s why, in collaboration with Starbucks, we released a guide to help cities transition to a zero waste model. A 75 percent diversion rate by 2030 could create 1.1 million jobs and reduce 276 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, equal to shutting down 72 coal power plants or removing 50 million cars from the road.

With the seismic shift toward smart cities and the internet of things (IoT), reliance on wireless and wireline broadband infrastructure is becoming greater and greater. Mobile phones, IoT devices and other small wireless gadgets are becoming ubiquitous. Wireless data consumption has reached approximately 1.8 exabytes per month in North America alone, and that number is projected to grow six-fold by 2022.

As cities navigate this rapidly-changing policy issue with both wireless and infrastructure providers and community residents, a number of considerations for the different stakeholders begin to emerge. We wrote this guide to help local elected officials navigate one crucial aspect of these changes: small cell deployment.

The census is changing. And we wanted to make sure cities understood what those changes would mean.

Municipal governments have an important relationship with the census — both as consumers of the invaluable data it gathers and as partners in ensuring the complete and accurate count of our cities. We released a guide to provide local leaders with objective information about and resources to prepare for the upcoming 2020 Census.

And where else but NLC would you expect to find an annual report analyzing the content of almost 200 mayors’ state of the city speeches? We break them down by region, topic and subtopic, and readers can rest assured that this guide is the best resource for tracking local trends across the country.

What did mayors care about most this year? Economic development, infrastructure and budgets and management topped the list. And in 2018, for the first time, opioids, broadband access and climate change have emerged as new and growing concerns.

84,VERGE Vanguard honorees celebrate clean economy achievements in 2018 | Greenbiz,"In the spirit of year-end reflection — and celebrating the progress we made over the past 12 months to accelerate the clean economy — we recently asked our inaugural cohort of the VERGE Vanguard a question: ""What do you think was the most significant development in 2018 for the clean economy transition?""

The eight responses we received from the mix of visionaries, network builders, corporate leaders and innovators we honored this year reinforce that, amidst all else, there’s a great deal to celebrate this holiday season.

The following are their responses, reflecting the diversity of promising signals across industries and sectors to celebrate — and continue advancing — as we head into the new year. The comments have been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Out of the blue, electric ""push"" scooters have arrived on city streets almost everywhere, causing commotion and anxiety. Remarkable is that their adoption and growth is 10 times that of shared bikes.

Reports from the Portland, Oregon, pilot find that nearly 50 percent of users had never been in a bike lane before (they are not your environmental cyclists!), and 36 percent otherwise would have traveled by car (among tourists, that rises to 48 percent).

So, here we have a widely adopted, small physical footprint, electric (potential for zero emissions) vehicle that could substitute for a significant percentage of people's trips. Bonus: they don't compete with transit since they are only used for short trips.

The emergence of strategies for turning waste carbon back into a valuable resource as a stepping stone towards building an economy that sequesters more carbon than it emits.

From farmers and ranchers deploying techniques to boost soil health, to entrepreneurs developing technologies for ""mining"" carbon from the sky, we have seen exponential progress and interest from scientists, businesses and policymakers alike.

Speaking broadly for the fashion and apparel industry, there has been one major pre-competitive development that has the potential to significantly transform the industry: The Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Make Fashion Circular initiative will catalyze the fashion industry to innovate toward a circular economy.

Like its work on plastics, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Make Fashion Circular most likely will create an industry-wide tipping point where we can collaborate to keep safe materials in use and to allow the industry to harness the enormous value that is lost in the current linear model.

In 2018, more countries set targets for driving fossil fuel cars and trucks off the road for good. Prior announcements from the United Kingdom, France, India, South Korea, Germany and more were added to from places as varied as Costa Rica, Denmark, Israel and Taiwan.

These clear policy signals will help attract multi-billion-dollar investments in new electromobility solutions that can save precious time in the global race to a clean energy future.

2018 has seen unprecedented momentum in the transition from a linear to a circular economy. In October, we launched the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment with more than 250 organizations, representing over 20 percent of the global plastic packaging market, to collaborate and innovate towards a circular economy for plastics.

Research initiatives from REMADE Institute, Material Economics and SITRA included landmark circular economy studies and open innovation projects.

Recognition is increasing as to the connections between materials, energy, economics, environment and society. In a circular economy, natural capital is regenerated; products are designed to be kept in use through repair, remanufacturing and resale; materials are valued and reused so they never become waste.

Moving from today’s model of extract and consume, to one in which we create and circulate value, will have a profound impact on global energy and resource demands.

2018 was the inflection point for mass deployment of off-grid solar and storage. Energy access helps people achieve common aspirations: economic opportunity, empowerment, health, security and education.

Consider Nigeria, Africa’s largest economy. Though oil-rich, its power grid is unreliable, forcing 100 million Nigerians to use diesel generators to meet basic energy needs. The results are higher carbon emissions, harmful pollution, excessive energy expenses and weaker economic growth.

These challenges represent a huge opportunity. With Nigeria’s population slated to overtake the United States, the time to switch to affordable, clean energy is now. Companies such as Africa-based ZOLA Electric are making it happen.

The release of the BBC’s ""Blue Planet II,"" which was the straw that broke the proverbial camel’s back, generating a global outcry from citizens.

This resulted in unprecedented new legislation to eliminate single-use items (from plastic straw bans to broader bans of single-use dining items); galvanized manufacturers and retailers to create daring solutions (like Tesco banning compostable packaging from all of their stores by April); and has created much needed public consciousness to the crisis of waste.

The most significant development in 2018: extreme weather events (wildfires, floods, hurricanes, etc.), coupled with the IPCC report, the National Climate Assessment and other reports that together fed a tidal wave of urgency — and an associated shift in the political climate in the United States that has opened the space to discuss real climate solutions at the federal, state and local level.

90,Firm plans to recycle plastics on Lagos waterways,"In order to preserve the coastal line, Food and Beverage Recycling Alliance (FBRA) has concluded joint arrangements aimed at recycling plastics and municipal wastes along waterways in Lagos State and its environs. Nigerian Bottling Company/Coca-Cola, Nigerian Breweries, Seven Up, Nestle Nigeria Plc and Guinness Nigeria are also ready to involve in cleaning up exercise as part their civil responsibilities.

 

 Vice Chairman of FBRA, Adekunle Olusuyi, told The Guardian in Abuja that they are looking at the entire packaging lifecycle, starting from bottles and cans to how they could be recycled and re-purposed in the city. He said they want to intensify awareness on separation of waste and environmental pollution, especially on post- consumer polyethylene terephthalate, PET bottles to other useful products.

According to him, “we want to reduce the waste we generate as much as possible as well as encourage recycling, and our initiatives in this regard has been well tailored in achieving tangible along with our partners.”

Olusuyi added that they are embarking on the clean-up in line with its commitment to Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policy of government to help build a sustainable healthy environment that leads to business growth.

“Recent survey indicates that the volume of post-consumer PET waste is over 800,000 tonnes, which requires participation of stakeholders at different stages to drive a robust circular economy,” he remarked.He therefore, urged other companies in the food and beverage sector to be part of FBRA, which has sworn in its resolve to protect the environment and help make the world packaging problem a thing of the past.",United States,2018.12
91,"2018, the year close the loop was taken seriously by the industry","Pablo Isla, the president of Inditex, exposed in an article of The Wall Street published in January which were going to be the four pillars of fashion’s future. In the fifth, Pablo Isla referenced the integration of circular economy into corporative strategies. In 2018, circularity was no longer something for eco-fashion only but something that would underpin the current system’s survival in the future. Parallelly, social and political pressure to shift towards circular economy is growing, and thus fashion, as one of the most important economic sectors in the world, is under the spotlight.

In May, H&M, Burberry, Nike, Stella McCartney and Gap joined forces to move forward together in this matter. These were the five companies chosen as strategic partners by Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the main lobby of circular economy. The collaboration was aimed at developing solutions for some of the biggest challenges of the fashion industry.

Sixteen companies more, amongst them Inditex, Kering, Primark or VF Corporation, showed their support towards the initiative. All of them committed to work together under three parameters: the development of business models that promote a longer conservation of clothes, the use of renewable and safe materials and the promotion of solutions for the treatment of used clothes.

Beyond agreements, the companies have started to give firm steps forward following that line. Thus, all through 2018, Zalando and Bestseller partnered up with start-up incubator Fashion for Good in their search for projects linked to circular economy; C&A invested 1.3 million euros for the release of five pilot projects that would implant circular economy in the fashion industry; American Guess joined forces with I:Collect, a global supplier for the reutilisation and recycling of clothes and footwear, whereas H&M, one of the pioneers regarding close the loop, advanced in this matters together with Hong Kong Institute of Textiles and Apparel (Hkrita).

Being sustainable is starting to be profitable too. In the last edition of Copenhagen Fashion Summit, The Boston Consulting Group together with Global Fashion Agenda presented the report Pulse Score, in which they revealed that the companies who build a business model in base to sustainability and manage to escalate it will improve their gross operating profit (Ebitda) in 2030 by one or two percentage points. The research also claimed that those who continue working with traditional systems will contrarily reduce it by three or four percentage points.

On the other hand, the social and political pressure also accelerates this situation and forces giants to speed up in investigation matters. At the beginning of the year, the French Government presented a series of legislative proposals to advance in circular economy. Amid them, there was the prohibition to incinerate or destroy clothing items that brands or stores do not sell out and forces both to donate them to institutions for their recycling or to NGOs for their reutilisation.

The British Parliament, for its part, has questioned the fast fashion system. The Lower House created a multi-party Environmental Audit Committee which started a profound investigation of the environmental impact of fashion and its wastes.",United States,2018.12
92,"There's a Bright Future for U.K. s, But Young Talent Needs Cultivating","Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

In the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business ranking for 2018, the U.K. came sixth out of 190. The U.K.'s strong entrepreneurial culture is firmly rooted in our spirit of innovation and enterprise, stretching back to the Industrial Revolution. And as we advance into the 21st century, a new generation of young people across the country is coming up with great ideas to solve business problems. But, in a competitive global marketplace, there is no space to rest on our laurels, and challenges remain for maximizing the potential of young entrepreneurs in the U.K.

A wealth of talent that is successfully being tapped

The U.K. is the home of great minds such as Alan Turing, the father of computer science, and Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web. And the U.K. is continuing to produce great ideas. Last month, NACUE's 9th Varsity Pitch finalists demonstrated the incredible pool of talent that this country has to offer.

This year's winner was WASE, a water treatment and sanitation startup, embracing the circular economy to recover clean water, energy and nutrients from wastewater. It's founder Thomas Fudge demonstrates the vital role of young entrepreneurs in tackling real-world sustainability problems and providing solutions for millions in the developing world.

Other competitors included Adelie Health, a startup offering a smart insulin pen that is saving lives by helping users manage their insulin doses. Meanwhile, Bubble Mind is planning to overturn the trend in worsening mental health, by creating apps to help relieve stress and improve mental well-being. UniDosh is even finding a way to tap the future graduate workforce by enabling university students to earn money providing services to their peers, such as babysitting, cleaning and assembling flatpack furniture.

Fortunately, the U.K. is, in fact, the most developed worldwide, when it comes to infrastructure to support young entrepreneurship. Young people have access to a wide range of programs and accelerators, offering funding and mentorship to nurture talent.

In particular, tech hubs exist across the country, with major corporations such as banks and law firms providing space for young entrepreneurs to develop the next ground-breaking business solution.

Keeping our eyes open to for collaborators and competitors abroad

As strong as U.K. entrepreneurship culture is, it is worth keeping a broader perspective on what is going on among our European neighbors. Within the context of Brexit, Britain must keep an open approach to future competitors and collaborators across the Channel.

Entrepreneurship in the Netherlands, for example, is a popular career path. But, it is often a second-choice career option, rather than the primary pathway for young people, according to NACUE research. Despite readily available funding opportunities for startups, young entrepreneurs tend to struggle more to find funding, since Dutch banks can be less inclined to offer early stage funding to this demographic.

Spain, too, is a hidden gem in terms of youth entrepreneurship. But, young entrepreneurs in Spain are limited by insufficient funding opportunities, with private and public stakeholders in the ecosystem often lacking coordination between their services. Young people want to learn from others about their failure stories in order to adapt their businesses accordingly, but they still do not know where to find them in the Spanish scenario.

Central Eastern European countries are offering small programs -- in particular, Romanian, Czech and Slovenian entrepreneurship is accelerating, though issues remain around knowledge of and access to funding across these countries, according to one of our consortium partners, MY-GATEWAY. Despite some of the challenges faced in these promising hubs, we should certainly be keeping an eye on where talent is emerging among our largest trading community.

Signposts to guide the way to a bright future

Across the U.K. and Europe, many organizations provide funding for the next generation of business leaders, but correct and relevant signposting to that funding is the recurring issue holding back greater success. Young people often find themselves relying on family and friends to secure early stage finance and existing inequalities can therefore refrain less advantaged youngsters from coming up with solutions for problems -- and with just the kind of perspective that can help transform society.

In fact, a young person may not even make the first steps to realize their business idea, without knowledge of how they can secure funding. We need to remember that the channels of funding can be extremely fragmented, across central and local government, as well as private and third sector opportunities. We can't expect young people to navigate these on their own.

Universities will remain a valuable piece of the puzzle in joining up the dots. But, we can't rely solely on this structure, as there may be many alumni, as well as those who haven't participated in higher education, with great business ideas and untapped talent. Networking days are a great opportunity to find out information, and local events that bring together players from across the ecosystem can be even more beneficial.

We shouldn't lose perspective on how valuable young entrepreneurs are within the bigger picture of the U.K.'s economic foundations. Youth entrepreneurship is very much part of the solution for tackling youth unemployment, stagnating economic growth and job creation.",United States,2018.12

94,The Top 10 TriplePundit Stories During 2018,"We’ve had quite the year here at TriplePundit, as there was no shortage of news stories, from brands taking stands to more advancements in clean energy technologies to more companies jumping on the circular economy bandwagon. Over the weekend, we crunched the numbers along with taking a look at the talk we generated on social media - and came up what we conclude are the ten most popular stories for 2019. The articles' authors are mentioned at the end of each summary.

Danone North America Is Now the Largest B Corp on Earth (1)

In 2017, Danone’s U.S. subsidiary announced it had completed the steps in order to become the largest public benefit corporation in the U.S. – and by last spring the company that owns brands such as Silk and Horizon Organic could verify that it had become the largest B Corp on the planet. Danone’s commitment to social responsibility is not relegated to the U.S. Additional subsidiaries have been granted B Corp or similar certification, including business units in Argentina, France, Indonesia, Spain and the United Kingdom. This work is among many reasons why Mariano Lozano, Danone North America’s president and CEO, was a winner at this fall’s Responsible CEO Awards at 3BL Forum. (Leon Kaye)

The next few years could be a breakout time for solar panels on electric vehicles, and what once seemed like something out of a Jetsons episode could be reality sooner than we think. Readers clearly are anticipating such cars that can drive us into this future, so this story about a German startup that plans to launch production in 2019 ended up ranking high on this list. (Tina Casey)

With uncertainty whether the world can truly come together and follow through on the Paris Agreement, yet alone on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), readers were smitten with this story about how the electric aviation industry believes solar technology is ready to meet the challenge of reducing emissions while helping the world meet global climate goals. (Amy Brown)

The circular economy has been a topic we’ve covered extensively this year. In January, an announcement that 30 companies across 16 industries would participate in a long-term project could have prompted more businesses to take action. All year long, we’ve seen a push for companies to adopt systems in which more waste is eliminated – or prevent the generation of garbage in the first place. (Leon Kaye)

Make Coal Great Again was one of President 45’s promises that helped him pull that inside straight ushering him into the White House two years ago. But all year long, our lead clean tech reporter has been documenting how economics, state and local policy, as well as the continued scaling up of renewables, together have made that campaign promise a nearly impossible one to deliver. (Tina Casey)

Corona Fights Ocean Pollution by Thinking Outside the Ring (6)

All year long, we’ve been witnessing that the little things matter for big reasons – and that includes plastic straws and how we clump together six-packs of beverages. At this rate, it won’t be long till “Joe Six-Pack” is renamed “Jose Biodegradable Six-Pack” or “Joe Snap Pack.” Hence the popularity of this news item covering Corona’s replacement for the plastic six-pack ring. (Tina Casey)

Only Two Fortune 500 CEOs Are Women of Color. What’s Up with That? (7)

Longtime PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi stepped down this fall, which at the time left only 24 women at the helm of America’s 500 largest publicly-traded companies – down from 32 the previous year. Despite all the talk about diversity and inclusion, plenty of questions remain about how penetrable the “glass ceiling” really is – especially for women of color. (Mary Mazzoni)

New Evidence That Rewarding Executives for Corporate Social Responsibility Really Does Work (8)

Are executives being compensated for genuine achievements, or are they simply collecting a bonus for successful greenwashing campaigns? That’s a fair question to ask, but a research team concluded that managers who foresee potential trouble spots and strategically target investments in corporate social responsibility (CSR) to address them are more likely to protect their firms from the effects of adverse events, while improving their companies’ overall reputation – and be rewarded in kind. (Tina Casey)

Small Businesses Can (and Should) Do More to Align with the SDGs

Earlier this year, four in 10 of the world’s largest firms referenced the SDGs in their corporate reporting, according to a study by KPMG, but many smaller companies remain unsure of how they can do their part. Case studies of how two small companies made alignment with the SDGs work for them resonated with readers, many of whom are looking here on 3p for direction. Trust us, we’ll cover this topic more in 2019. (Mary Mazzoni)

Transportation Now Largest Source of U.S. Emissions, While Renewables Surge

Why does this story matter? First the good news: renewables have helped the global power generation sector become more efficient and decrease emissions. But the fact that worldwide, transportation is generating more emissions than power generation for the first time in 40 years shows that the pressure is on automakers, logistic companies and the aviation industry to do their part to accelerate climate action.

95,"Our Waste, Our Resources - My Reflections","In the wake of the government’s publication of the Resources and Waste Strategy, Dr Adam D. Read, external affairs director, SUEZ SUEZ recycling and recovery UK reflects on the Strategy – and Christmas.

OPINION: It’s finally here, and the excitement almost mirrors that of Christmas morning for most children in the UK who wake to find the mince pies gone and an arrangement of wrapped presents under the tree.

After months of speculation about the principles, scope and content of the much anticipated Waste and Resources Strategy, we now know with more certainty just what the Government has in store for the resources and waste sector over the next 30 years, and perhaps more importantly the next six months.

Expectations have been high for some time that we would find many of the big ticket items covered off in the document, including Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) reform, food waste initiatives, measures to simplify recycling for consumers, elimination of avoidable plastic waste and tackling waste crime.

And I am sure you won’t be disappointed. The new Resources and Waste Strategy for England, the first of its kind since 2007, focuses on a number of known issues namely:

 [1] reducing our reliance on single-use plastics;

 [2] cutting confusion over household recycling;

 [3] tackling the problems of packaging;

 and [4] putting an end to food waste, whilst providing the necessary linkages to targets set out in previous Government strategies including the Clean Growth Strategy and 25 Year Environment Strategy.

I firmly believe that this strategy provides the much needed framework to revolutionise recycling and support progress towards any number of circular systems (and economy).

It also reflects a significant number of the initiatives and interventions that SUEZ outlined in our vision for a more sustainable resource and waste management earlier in the year SUEZ – Future Vision

I am happy that the themes in the strategy are consistent with the debates we have been engaging in with both Government and key sector organisations over the last 9 months. I am equally glad there is nothing in here that shocks me as it shows that Government have been listening to us all when it comes to what we wanted to see, what is really needed to encourage change and investment, and where the system is failing us.

So what are some of my personal highlights from the strategy?

First and foremost is the Government’s intention to introduce Full Net Cost Recovery Producer Responsibility, which requires businesses and manufacturers to pay the full cost of recycling or disposing of their packaging waste. This sets the bar higher than in Europe for cost recovery, and should ensure funds are available to pay for litter clean-up, materials campaigns and perhaps even the transition costs where new services and infrastructure are required. This is the game changer that we all hoped for, and in January 2019 we will have a chance to influence the scope and design of the system through planned consultations.

Of interest for those of us that work across the UK, the Government is keen to see both an EPR and a deposit return system (DRS) that is applicable in all of the home nations, and I can’t support this agenda enough. This is key for the businesses that sell products across the UK, and for consumers wherever they live and work. This should provide an interesting political dialogue throughout 2019 as Scotland progress with its own plans for DRS.

And given my background in local government and consultancy I am also focused on the Government’s intention to simplify collection systems for consumers, from improved consumer product sustainability labelling and measures to create greater consistency of collected materials, not just packaging, but food waste too. The proposal is for a nationally agreed set of packaging materials for collection and the adoption of minimum service standards which deliver good quality recyclate (a pre-requisite of the EPR reform). I support this plan of action.

So good news all round then?

For all the positivity being shown across the sector on both the scope and ambition in the strategy there are four fundamental concerns that I have about the deliverability of the strategy, which are shared with many of my peers.

[1] the timetable for change shows little being delivered before 2023 (although there are plenty of work streams underway to influence solutions and policies before then);

 [2] the lack of detail currently available on how much of the change will be implemented (this will be a key theme in the consultations);

 [3] the risk that over time (and through the consultations) the ambitions of the strategy are watered down; and

 [4] the lack of clarity on UK reprocessing capacity and infrastructure development (which may form part of the EPR consultation).

But, I remain positive, the general direction is good, the joined up thinking makes sense, and the overall level of ambition is in line with what the sector have been asking for over a number of year. So what next?

Opportunity knocks and now is the time to get on board and contribute

It is clear from the strategy that many of the Government’s intentions and policies are ‘subject to consultation’, with seven expected consultations in the first quarter of 2019, covering off some of the ‘meatier’ issues like EPR, DRS, consistency, mandatory weekly food waste collections and standards for bio-based and biodegradable plastics etc.

This is the opportunity to be heard, to contribute to designing a gold standard system that enables materials to be captured for recycling in the most cost-effective way, whilst contributing to a new circular economy.

One thing is for sure, change is happening in our sector, and sitting on your hands and staying quiet won’t change this. So get involved, whether corresponding directly with DEFRA on the consultations, or through your appropriate trade / professional / representative bodies, all of whom are already planning events, workshops, webinars and discussions to brief you of the issues and hear your thoughts, concerns and ideas.

So make sure you put some quiet time aside this Christmas to unwrap the most welcome of Christmas presents from Mr Gove, digest its aspirations, and mull over the issues that will most impact you. You can then be ready to engage in what will probably be the busiest year in the resources and waste sector in my lifetime. And that’s exciting!

As always, my opinions are my own, and I welcome any conversation or feedback you might have on the issues I have raised. Please contact me at: adam.read@suez.com.",United States,2018.12
96,E-waste managementcampaign to reach city,"A campaign to create awareness among people about the importance of responsible and safe e-waste disposal and treatment will soon reach Hyderabad, among 19 other cities. Awareness on environmental hazards of electronic and Information Technology being run by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has partnered with Manufacturers Association for Information Technology (MAIT) to run the Clean to Green campaign.

Anwar Shirpurwala, CEO, MAIT, said on Monday, “E-waste management in India is a highly unorganised sector. Through this programme, MAIT seeks to build awareness amongst various stakeholders by reaching out to 20 cities in 17 States and three Union Territories in the country”. The Clean to Green campaign is a collaborative effort with the electronics industry and corporate bodies to ensure responsible disposal and recycling of e-waste.

A total of 35 organisations in Hyderabad will be part of the campaign.

Currently, India ranks fifth among the largest producers of e-waste in the world. Just 1.5% of all e-waste generated in the country is recycled adequately. It is estimated that by the year 2020, India will be generating almost 52 lakh metric tonnes of e-waste. Presently, this figure is estimated at 18 lakh metric tonnes.

Further, around 76% of e-waste workers in India suffer from respiratory ailments and India’s e-waste continues to increase at 30% annually, the campaign organisers claimed. Safe and appropriate recycling of e-waste reduces air, soil and water pollution, and also ensures a move towards resource efficiency and circular economy, the organisers said.",United States,2018.12
97,EXCLUSIVE: How Spain's high fashion designers are turning recycled plastic into runway collections,"PLASTIC gets a bad rap these days – and for good reason.

Radiohead sang about Fake Plastic Trees back in 1995, using plastic as a symbol for the dehumanising aspects of modernity.

More than 20 years on, the fashion world is finding ways of giving the wretched material a more positive spin as a handful of designers and brands begin to weave recycled PET (polyethylene terephthalate) into their latest creations.

‘Slow fashion’ is the long-awaited antidote to the throwaway culture. And Spain’s coastline has become the source not only of a healthy Mediterranean diet but also of recycled thread.

Driven by frustration at the excessive use of the world’s natural resources, Javier Goyeneche set up Ecoalf in 2009 after the birth of his son in a bid to create a truly sustainable fashion brand. By 2015, his Upcycling the Oceans programme was plundering Spain’s – and Thailand’s – seas for plastic waste. Since then, 3,000 fishermen have reeled in 250 tons of it, subsequently turning it into sneakers and a range of jackets and coats that consumers can feel good in.

Meanwhile Spanish designers Juanjo Oliva and Moisés Nieto have come up with recycled plastic collections that have adorned Spain’s most prestigious catwalks.

Selected by recycling pioneers Ecoembes to produce designs using recycled PET for the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in July, Juanjo Oliva delivered what he dubbed the Oliva Collection III.

Almost all the garments were cut from 100% PET fabrics into a no-frills all-weather look in muted shades of blue and black. As Juanjo says, the recycled PET fabric currently available is very similar to nylon.

“It is good for sportswear and rain gear,” the designer explained to the Olive Press.

“More sophisticated recycled plastic fabrics would be more expensive to produce and consumers are increasingly less sophisticated. In general, people don’t dress up anymore for the theatre or dinner. They don’t care about coordinating their gloves with their scarf and skirt. And there aren’t many who have silk or designer clothes in their wardrobes.

“The Olive Collection III was aimed at making clothes that people want. A raincoat can be cute or ugly. If it’s cute and well designed and people want to wear it and, on top of that, it’s using recycled plastic, it becomes an interesting project.”

Juanjo was selected by Ecoembes because of his cutting-edge and environmentally-friendly credentials. “Luckily, there are an increasing number of designers like Juanjo Oliva who are aware of the potential fashion has to drive new consumer trends and create a social conscience,” Elena López, head of Ecoembes communications, told the Olive Press. “And that helps to make these kinds of fabrics more ‘democratic’ and mainstream.”



What many of us don’t realise is that much of our clothing is made from various forms of plastic – just not the recycled kind. One look at the label and you will likely see polyester, acrylic, nylon and other synthetic fibres in the mix. These materials are far cheaper than the recycled variety, despite Ecoembes’ insistence that the price is not wildly different.

Ecoalf’s sneakers, for example, are over €100 and its jackets and coats closer to the €200 mark. Meanwhile, Juanjo’s collection [available from his shop in C/José Marañon 4, Madrid] has a price tag of between €300 and €600 which is, he says, cheaper than his other designs. But some sceptics are not convinced.

“The problem with making clothes from recycled plastic is that you are creating a material that is now indestructible,” says Paloma García López, the founder of The Circular Project, which supports 30 small designers exploiting recycled materials. “The PET is woven into other fabrics to make it more durable. But how do you recycle the recycled? The process of separating the plastic from these other materials is very difficult and expensive.”

Another drawback is that it is inadvisable to wear plastic-based fabrics against the skin due to the hormone disruptors connected to cancer. Sneakers and coats generally have a layer in between, but it does raise questions about the desirability of taking the concept further.

Juanjo, however, believes that we have to work within the framework of the world as it is.

“We’re not living in the 1900s on an Amish farm,” he points out. “Isn’t it better that the nylon you’re wearing against your skin is recycled? In any case, there is no natural fabric that hasn’t been through some kind of industrial process and all thread has some nylon in it, so we have to be realistic. Everything has its downside.”

Elena from Ecoembes rejects the notion that consumers might be lulled into believing that if plastic can be recycled in this way, there is no need to cut it out. 



“Fortunately,” she says, “consumers are increasingly aware of the importance of caring for the environment. The study Brands with Values revealed that 60% of Spaniards prefer to buy clothes that have been made with the social and environmental impact in mind.”

But Paloma is not as upbeat about our consumer awareness. “I give talks at universities and the students end up with their mouths open,” she says. “They have no idea how much of their clothes are made from plastic, nor the amounts of polluting chemicals which are used in the production process. There’s also the social aspect. So many in the industry outsource to companies in the developing world where child labour is common. These are the things we don’t see.”

According to Paloma, fashion is now the second most contaminating industry on our planet, hard on the heels of the oil industry. “Clothes get thrown out and leak chemicals into the environment. We have to buy less.”

Juanjo agrees. He says greater thought needs to go into our wardrobe. “People have no criteria when they shop and that has to change,” he says. “People have mounds of clothes that lack character and design and all they do is fuel the consumer machine. Marketing has drilled it into us that it is good to buy on impulse and they’ve done a great job of turning us into sheep.”

It takes between 450 and 1,000 years for plastic to decompose – plenty of time for it to poison the planet’s ecosystems, and discarded clothes have become a huge part of the problem.

On the bright side, Paloma says, “I’m convinced we’ll get to the point where plastic stops being produced. Meanwhile, I understand we have to give what we have a use.”",United States,2018.12

101,Resurfaced circular debt threatening the economy: PEW,"The Pakistan Economy Watch (PEW) on Sunday said the circular debt has again resurfaced and is threatening the fragile national economy.

The infamous power sector debt has surpassed Rs1300 billion and there is no way in sight to tackle it which is adding to the problems of the government, it said.

The government has decided to issue Rs200 billion Sukuk bonds to handle the debt which will calm down the issue for a year or two but not resolve the problem, said PEW president Dr Murtaza Mughal.

He said that past governments have promised reforms in the power sector but did nothing concrete while a former finance minister announced to bury the debt forever in 2013 but left it unresolved before leaving the country to avoid accountability.

The incumbent government had promised to resolve the issue of circular debt during the election campaign and now it should come up to its promise, he added.

Dr Murtaza Mughal said that the government has decided to issue Sukuk bonds against the 43 assets of power generation and distribution companies which will not only help it handle the problem and also help boost the Islamic finance industry.

Six Islamic banks have completed most of the spadework and only minor irritants have been left to be removed before the launch of bonds, he added.

The market share of Islamic banking industry stands at 13.6 per cent of total banking assets. The industry has grown over twenty percent during the last five years but it is yet to make major advances.

The increasing role of Islamic banks in the overall banking sector and their potential for providing strength to the economy must be appreciated, he demanded.",United States,2018.12
102,From forest to fashion in Finland with a new textile process,"Earth-friendly fashion is becoming a reality in Finland, where the Ioncell startup is refining its technology to make clothes out of recycled newspapers, wood pulp waste and even old discarded textiles that are getting a new life.

The cutting-edge couture is also getting the royal treatment, with Finland’s first lady Jenni Haukio attending a December Independence Day reception while wearing an evening gown made from birch tree pulp. The pulp was reclaimed at the Stora Enso paper and packaging factory in Joensuu, Finland.

“Stora Enso supports the new method of producing textile fibers developed by Aalto University and the University of Helsinki and supplies dissolving pulp as the raw material for the project,” the company said. “The textile fiber used in Haukio’s gown was produced using the new Ioncell method.”

Just seven percent of the world’s textiles are made using wood-based materials, Stora Enso said, while fossil-based products like polyester synthetics and input-hungry cotton account for about 70 percent. To change that – and change the carbon footprint of future clothing – the company invested €52 million in converting one of its mills to produce dissolving pulp needed for Ioncell’s process.

The gown was designed by students at Aalto, a partner on developing the experimental fabric process. “I took inspiration from strong Finnish women, who are represented in the dress’ minimalist features and clear lines. The dress is a promise of a cleaner, brighter future,” said Emma Saarnio, part of a team of designers, textile engineers and yarn weavers, dye experts and dressmaking experts.

While the elegant gown made headlines, it’s just one of the products that Ioncell is making after its researchers have spent a decade on the science. President Emmanuel Macron of France has received a dress scarf made from recycled cotton; there are coats, dresses, ruffly summer tops, even iPad and mobile phone covers, all transformed from waste pulp, newsprint or old cotton.

“So far we are publicly funded,” says the university-affiliated Ioncell, which is meeting its timeline milestones for product development and pilot launch design. “In 2020, we plan to open a pilot plant, a small factory where we can produce textiles for our customers to test.”

Yet as the company notes, Ioncell was first and foremost a research project that’s met with some success. Scientists developed a nontoxic ionic liquid that dissolves cellulose from the plant-based sources, making it useful for creating fabrics and possible to combine with other materials. Water and the ionic fluid are the only two ingredients, and they’re carefully recycled in a closed-loop process.

There are no microplastics that break down in wear or washing, and the products are biodegradable.

Does it feel like you’re wearing wood? Ioncell assures that it doesn’t. The fibers are soft and strong, they say, and measure up to the workload as well as Tencel® or viscose – the latter a cause for pollution concerns in China, Indonesia and India, where much of the global supply is produced. Viscose use also is a concern for brands like Levi Strauss and H&M when targeted by campaigners.

The promising Ioncell process may make for new directions in fashion with an alternative material, at a time when the industry is pledging to do its part in building the circular economy.",United States,2018.12
105,Unilever Is Betting On This Company To Deliver Sustainability At Scale,"Cleaning products giant Seventh Generation is rolling out commercial products now. The Unilever-owned company has focused most of its energy till date on consumer products, bringing awareness to the toxic chemicals used in household cleaning products historically. Its success led to Unilever acquiring the brand for $700 million in 2016. This year, the company features in a new documentary on Netflix, Stink, divulging some of the dirty secrets of the industry and the unknown toxins in daily life.

Although consumer awareness is growing about the use of chemicals in homes, the cleaning products used in schools, offices, and public spaces are not as closely scrutinized. “You don’t know what a company is using, because these products are purchased by third parties or distributors,” says Joey Bergstein, CEO of Seventh Generation.

That’s where the cleaning giant wants to grow their business. “We need to find a way to democratize true clean. This should not just be about products for the wealthy,” he says.

Seventh Generation's latest line of professional cleaning products have similar formulations as the ones sold to consumers but are packaged differently according to industry standards, he explains. “The core formulations are largely the same. But the labeling and packaging has to be done differently.”

Catering to a new industry, Seventh Generation is working with distributors who sell to restaurants, hotels, offices, and other large-scale businesses to access customers that otherwise the company could not reach, Bergstein argues.

Though priced comparable to its competitors, there is a small premium, he admits. “We are consistent with market pricing, within a 10 percent premium of leading conventional brands.”

And that premium, he argues, is not a deal breaker; in fact, the messaging and marketing to guests, staff, and the individuals that will be occupying the space outweighs the added cost.

Bergstein sees that consumers are already waking up to non-toxic, more eco-friendly friendly products. The natural, wellness and eco-friendly space is only 20 percent of the market, he notes, yet is growing at 70 percent.

But the nuances of a healthy lifestyle need iterating and further education, Bergstein adds. “Think about it, we eat 2 to 3 pounds of food each day. Yet, we consume 30 to 40 pounds of air every day.”

Cleaners are just one element in a hodgepodge of factors that affect air quality. Though most consumers are more focused on diets, air quality and environment, he argues, is just as important as eating well.

While this is all noteworthy, Seventh Generation is still toying with one element of their eco-friendly business: packaging. Their concoctions, be it for consumer or commercial use, come in some form of packaging. Through years of research and development, Bergstein says, the company has made some strides: most of their packaging is now made with 100 percent post-consumer recycled content. Only laundry bottles are stuck at 80 percent, with the remaining 20 percent being a bio-based material.

There’s still one issue: Seventh Generation sells a lot of liquids, many of these are water-based. Shipping water around the country means heavier boxes and more packaging, particularly when it comes to laundry detergent. To solve this problem, the company is turning to concentrated formations. “We’re looking at how to take water out of our portfolio. It’s more efficient to ship around the country then and it just makes sense.”

Seventh Generation sells primarily in the US, with some sales in Canada. When working in the beer industry, Bergstein found a recycling program in Canada with beer bottles that he’d like to adapt to the cleaning industry. “There’s an industry standard and agreement. Everyone uses the same brown bottles. People return them to the store and they get redistributed back to the manufacturer and refilled. And so those bottles get used on average about 18 times. People bring back the glass bottles because there’s a financial incentive to do so. Could we create something like that or be part of for plastic packaging?”

Bergstein is actively looking for innovations in recycling and how to build a circular economy because the company has a target in sight: by 2025, he wants everything that is recyclable to be recycled and everything that is biodegradable to be biodegraded by Seventh Generation.

Doing that means working in tandem with packaging manufacturers and municipalities. Creating that kind of systemic change in the industry, he acknowledges is not something that the company can do on its own. Given the limitations that still exist in the packaging industry, the need for solutions, and better recycling processes that ensure recyclable materials actually are repurposed, not sold overseas or disposed of in a landfill, Bergstein is keen on collaborating to uphold Seventh Generation’s mission as a brand.

“People are motivated by their wallets. The higher the return rate, the higher the recycling rate. That could be part of the solution,” he says.

If Seventh Generation is going to work in the commercial space, then building a circular, or responsible, economy becomes even more necessary for the brand -- and if it were to work, it could have a broad, society-wide impact.",United States,2018.12
106,Luken flat-pack furniture is made from recycled plastic bottles in Mexico,"Mexican architecture firm Paola Calzada Arquitectos produces its line of robust flat-pack furniture using recycled plastic bottles and wood-fibre material valchromat.

Made in Mexico under the brand name Luken, the line of furniture includes a series of side tables as well as chairs and tables for children that can be assembled without nails or glue.

The pieces are made from either 100 per cent recycled plastic bottles melted down into boards or 12-millimetre-thick panels of valchromat – a through-coloured MDF material made from wood harvested from sustainably certified forests in Portugal.

The panels of plastic board or valchromat simply slot together to form the pieces. The furniture made from valchromat is designed for use inside only, while the recycled plastic furniture is resistant to sunlight, water and heavy use and therefore robust enough to be used both inside and out.

""No chemicals are added in the manufacturing process of our materials,"" said the brand. ""After cutting the boards, the result is flat pieces that are simply assembled in the client's house. No nails or glue are required.""

""Products can be sent to all parts of the world and flight services are not expensive due to the flat package,"" they added.

Concerned about plastic pollution and its effect on the environment, the Mexico City firm's founder architect Paola Calzada Prats, started producing the furniture in order to help reduce plastic in the ocean and to promote awareness of the problem among younger generations.

""We are fed up with the images of garbage floating in the sea, and decided to take the tip of the iceberg and give it a better future,"" the brand said.

""We are literally swimming in plastic, it's been proven that there are micro particles of plastic in the fish we eat, and bottles from Mexican products have been dragged by sea currents as far as the coast of the UK.""

To this date, Luken said it has recycled up to 80,000 plastic bottles preventing them from ending up in rivers, lakes and oceans. Each piece in the collection recycles approximately 600 bottles made from polyethylene.

Earlier this year Antwerp-based brand Ecobirdy debuted a range of colourful kids' furniture made from recycled plastic toys. With an overarching goal of introducing children to the circular economy, all the pieces from Ecobirdy's collection are completely recyclable.

107,Comment: MPs’ motion important step toward eliminating plastic pollution,"You might have read a powerful piece in the Times Colonist this week about the power of youth in stopping plastic pollution (“Don’t dismiss power of youth in stopping plastic pollution,” comment, Dec. 16).

It was written by 16-year-old Anastasia Castro. In her op-ed, she references the newly passed NDP Motion M-151, a national strategy to combat plastic pollution.

What Anastasia fails to mention is that credit for the M-151 belongs to her and Kids for a Plastic-Free Canada. She had an impact on us.

We are Vancouver Islanders, fathers and members of Parliament for ridings that are economically and culturally dependent on a pristine marine environment. Our communities are increasingly concerned about the crisis of plastic pollution in our streams, rivers, lakes and oceans.

If you are a millennial or centennial, like Anastasia, you are likely the one sounding the alarm, calling for real action to change the way we consume single-use plastics, for corporations to end their industrial use of plastic and for governments to regulate and legislate plastic use in our society.

Plastic pollution in our waterways is a real, direct and growing threat — to both our fragile ecosystems and human health. For more than 50 years, the production and consumption of plastics have continued to rise, and more than 300 million tonnes of plastic are produced globally each year.

It is estimated that by 2050 there will be more plastic by weight than fish in our oceans.

This plastic isn’t just floating, of course. It’s breaking down into microscopic particles that enter aquatic food chains and contain a host of carcinogens. Because of the rapid rise of the use of plastics and their accumulation in our food chains, the threat to human health will only increase without concrete action.

While Canada has signed on to both the UN Clean Seas Initiative, and the G7’s new Ocean Plastics Charter, talk of creating a “circular economy” without binding regulations will not get the job done. Last month, the federal and provincial environment ministers agreed to work on a plan to cut Canada’s garbage by 50 per cent and eliminate plastic waste by 2040. This is a positive goal, but the government’s weak targets don’t reflect the severity of the crisis — and without tangible, immediate action, we won’t meet them.

Other nations are backing their pledges, promises and good intentions with concrete action now — and Canada must do the same. The European Union has introduced regulations to eliminate certain plastics by 2021. Strong measures such as those are needed here, too.

Thanks to calls to action from Canadians, particularly young Canadians, members of Parliament took a first step this month in responding to this urgency when they voted unanimously in support of NDP Motion M-151 for a national strategy on ocean plastics. Based on the findings of the University of Victoria Environmental Law Centre’s “Seven Reforms to Address Marine Plastic Pollution,” Motion M-151 provides a path forward on plastic pollution.

The actions identified in M-151 are aimed at reducing plastic-debris discharge from storm-water outfalls, the industrial use of microplastics, and consumer and industrial use of single-use plastics.

Together, these reforms comprise a comprehensive strategy to reduce and eliminate Canadian-source plastic pollution in our water — and ultimately to redesign Canada’s plastics economy.

At the same time, dedicated annual funding is required for the cleanup of derelict fishing gear, including ghost nets; to support community-led initiatives to recover plastics and debris from our shores; and for education and outreach on the root causes and negative environmental impacts of plastic pollution.

Members of Parliament of all political stripes have taken the first step to answer the resounding ocean-plastics alarm by supporting M-151, but now the federal government must turn that promise of support into concrete government action. For the sake of our planet and our youth, we hope they do.

109,Students across the Country Join Hands to Curb Plastic Pollution,"Gurgaon : The combined energies of more than 3000 students from 80+ colleges and higher institutions across the country, at the MDI, Gurgaon campus have found out ways to mitigate the disposal of ‘pet bottle’ waste. Facilitated by Volunteer4India (V4I) organisation, these students have traced the journey of the plastic waste generated in their localities and have chalked out plans to manage the waste through effective coordination with different stake holders.

These students joined forces through Beyond Karma – a social case study competition organised by MDI Gurgaon. This youth-connect initiative is an integral part of Imperium’18, the annual management festival of MDI Gurgaon, organised in association with Samaritans, MDI.

As part of the case study (Where is my Pet Going), students from reputed institutions like IIMs, NITs, FMS, IIFT, MICA conducted field studies in their respective localities. Out of these, 7 finalised teams presented their white papers at MDI before the expert panel.

As a pilot, around 200 students will visit condominiums, apartments, residential societies, shopping malls, food joints and corporate houses across Gurgaon, where they intend to identify the current state of PET segregation and recycling and raise awareness about the process of recycling.

The primary intention of this project on the one hand, is to let the citizens be responsive and consciously put efforts and on the other hand, make corporates responsible towards the cause

These volunteers will further be trained towards the process of effective disposals of pet bottles; they will be monitoring the process in their respective localities and will coordinate with local rag pickers to ensure that even they follow the segregation process with the necessary due diligence. This intention is identify the bottlenecks in implementation and then work out a plan to address that.

The initial target is to implement this in at least 25-30 condominiums, 10 corporates and 5 shopping malls. The students will further run citizen awareness campaigns in these areas. The pilot activity will run for 45 days in Gurgaon.

As an outcome of the activation, MDI and Volunteer4India will organise a conference where corporates, relevant government departments and citizen forums will be brought together and MDI will present the findings of their activation, for them to take notice.

The objective is to evaluate the current state of on- ground implementation of a brand’s Extended Producer Responsibility and makes brands to get responsible about it, ensuring almost all Pet bottles become a part of the circular economy.

111,Embracing the circular economy this Xmas,"For the first time the Circular Economy made it to the top of the list – the reused garment is anticipated to be this year´s most popular gift.

 

 Another sign of the Circular Economy gaining ground in society was during this year´s Nobel festivities where both the Minister of Culture and Democracy and the Crown Princess opted for reused dresses.

From the Exponential Climate Action Roadmap where we participated with Future Earth, SITRA, World Wildlife Foundation (WWF), Stockholm Resilience Center (SRC), Mission 2020 and others we know that the transition, from linear to circular, is one of the most important ways for the industry sector to halve emissions by 2030. 

 

 Halving global emissions within that timeframe is in line with the global Carbon Law. Carbon Law, which was introduced by Science Mag last year and reflects the decarbonization rate demanded by science and is in line with IPCC´s 1,5 degrees report. 

 

 Generally, I believe that awareness of the relationship between global warming and material usage is increasing.

Our recent peer-reviewed study on the ICT sector´s overall materials footprint indicates that it represent about 0,5% of the global annual usage of relevant materials when also including the materials used by the entertainment and media (E&M) sector. For several rare metals (indium, gallium and germanium), however, the usage of these sectors represents as much as 80-90% of the overall usage.



We also estimated that their use of materials represents about 0.9% of the carbon footprint for the relevant materials, and about 0.1% of the total global carbon footprint, while the sectors material resource depletion potential is estimated to be between 13% and 48% of overall global depletion for the selected materials, using standard methods with different definitions of depletion. Finally, the toxicity of the selected materials, plus cement production, ICT and E&M are estimated to represent about 3.3%, based on a commonly adopted method (ReCiPe).

Within the sector, we know from our carbon footprint studies at Ericsson Researchthat for networks, embodied emissions and materials represent just a small fraction of the overall greenhouse gas emissions. Energy performance is what matters most. For devices with short lifespans, such as the smartphone, the embodied emissions from production is similar in size as the usage.

With that in mind, recycling a smartphone, tablet or laptop to give it a second life, thereby avoiding the production of a new one, makes a lot of sense.

Working with environmental aspects of ICT, the choice was simple when my family this year needed both a new laptop and a new PC. Reused products made the best sense and as a bonus they also came with a lower cost. 



After investigating in the market, we chose two different firms which both sold reused ICT equipment. Finding the right product was simple as the webpages were designed to give specific information about the individual product to be purchased, and filters could be used to define the product condition that we requested. 



In both cases the products were delivered promptly and as we had opted for high-quality items, it was very hard to tell them apart from new products. Unfortunately, after some months of use, the back camera of the phone suddenly stopped working, a problem that a quick scan showed was quite common for this smartphone model and which could just as well has happened with a new unit. As the guarantee period had not ended we returned the smartphone for repair/replacement and got it back within just a few days.

So, with this experience in mind, I´m happy that previous owner resisted the urge to store their old smartphone in a drawer just in case it could be used by someone else within the family, and instead sent it to the reuse company. 



For materials to circulate it is important to re-circle old products for reuse and to recycle materials – but with linear business models incentives are often too weak. 



For this reason, I was really happy when Ericsson recently switched to a circular model for the company smartphones and now offers them as a service to employees, with a promise to exchange them and put them to use when later replaced.

Enough about this, the Christmas is approaching. Over the coming days many people, at least last-minutes like myself, will be running around, or use their smartphones, to find Christmas gifts for families and friends. When doing so think about the climate and go circular – it saves the environment and brings good bang for the buck. And if you have been really nice, Santa might even bring you a reused smartphone 😉. 



But remember the best thing about Christmas – to spend time with your dear ones and get some time for reflection - is already circular and mostly also low-carbon. And for New Year our most important New Year´s resolution would be to cut down on carbon rather than or calories!",United States,2018.12
112,The Denim Industry Inches Toward a Circular Economy as Mills Adopt Recycled Fibers,"The denim industry is good at making “new” feel old. The plethora and popularity of vintage-inspired denim collections in the market can attest to that.

However, new recycled fibers and technologies are also allowing the denim industry to become increasingly good at making “old” feel and look new.

Lenzing’s Refibra technology gained momentum in 2018 as a network of global mills like Artistic Milliners, Candiani, Dynamo, Prosperity, Soorty and more, integrated fiber made from upcycled post-production cotton scraps and wood pulp sourced from certified sustainable forestry.

The fiber has been implemented into 12 retail programs with brands like Levi’s, DL1961, Kings of Indigo and Reformation.

And Lenzing is ramping up the amount of waste it’s recycling for Refibra—a request that’s coming direct from the denim market. In 2019, Lenzing will begin to offer Refibra made with 10 percent more post-industrial cotton, increasing the amount of waste recycled from 20 percent to 30 percent.

Lycra has made strides to improve performance in stretch technologies, and advance both their comfort and sustainability in denim. The company’s latest innovation, Lycra T400 with EcoMade technology, maintains the stretch, recovery and retention characteristics of Lycra T400 fiber but with a sustainable twist.

Lycra T400 with EcoMade is comprised of 68 percent sustainable fibers. Jean Hegedus, global director of Invista’s denim business, explained that 50 percent of the fiber is made from recycled PET and 18 percent made from plant-based materials. Hegedus added that the fiber fits in nicely with brands that have 2020 sustainability goals to meet, and lives up to the performance standards of its popular predecessor.

Mills are also creating circular economies in their own production.

Italian denim mill Berto introduced Pianeta, a fabric made with 35 percent cotton and 65 percent cotton yarn regenerated from its own production waste.

Berto marketing director Francesca Polato explained that when the indigo dyeing process has stopped, extra dyed yarn remains on either end of the line. This unavoidable waste is transformed into a new yarn, ultimately allowing the mill to slash its water consumption. The fabric is also treated with a new finishing process that requires 85 percent less water than the standard process and reduces CO2 emissions.

Mexico-based mill Global Denim also tested a new collection of closed loop denim. The fabric is made with recycled fabrics from its own facilities.

Recycled polyester continues to be a popular component. Twin Dragon reported that it is using pre-reduced indigo liquid, adopting water- and chemical-reducing finishing processes and ramping up its use of recycled polyester in 2018. The mill is moving to 100 percent recycled polyester throughout its entire collection.

S Gene with Repreve remains a key product for Cone Denim. The stretch technology, which was upgraded with the branded recycled polyester fiber in 2017, offers brands a sustainable dual-core stretch product. Sewing thread made with Repreve from Cone’s sister company, American & Efird, is poised to further enhance brands’ eco stories.

Indigo Textile Ltd. takes a multi-prong approach to sustainability. In 2018 the mill bowed 100 percent recycled fabrications made with recycled cotton and polyester. The mill also rolled out Orbit, a collection of laser-friendly denim that dyes just the outer core of the yarn. The denim has the same look of denim dyed through to the center, but requires 30 percent less water.

And a truly sustainable jean considers every detail, down to the zipper tape. YKK launched its new environmentally friendly zipper called Natulon. The product is produced from recycled plastic materials, which are broken into pieces, reproduced as pellets, and finally yarn to make the sustainable zipper tape.

The trims company also presented a lyocell fiber zipper made from Tencel fiber yarn tape. The 100 percent Tencel fabric provides a smooth touch for consumers with sensitives skin, absorbs moisture and dries faster than YKK standard cotton zippers, plus it reduces the growth of bacteria.",United States,2018.12
116,Progress Update: Is the EU Ready to Halve Food Waste?,"Following ambitious European Union (EU) food waste reduction targets set earlier this year, the EU Platform on Food Losses and Food Waste met to take stock of progress.

Food waste prevention is part of the EU’s plan for a “circular economy:” a transition intended to improve global competitiveness, encourage sustainable growth, and create new jobs. In the 2015 EU Action Plan for the Circular Economy, EU Member States committed to meeting the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12.3, reducing retail and consumer food waste by 50 percent by 2030. The 2018 Revised EU Waste Legislation expanded upon this target by including calls to reduce food waste at every stage of the food system and report food waste levels.

Under the agreement, Member States are currently developing national plans to achieve these targets including methods to record and report progress, awareness campaigns, and incentives for redistributing food. Some Member States started building policies toward targets: in 2016, the French government passed legislation that prohibits supermarkets from throwing away food approaching its sell-by-date, mandating that they redirect the food to charities or food banks.

“While momentum is growing, and progress in 2018 is promising, we need to do more—move more boldly and quickly to meet the target of reducing food waste by half by 2030,” says European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety Vytenis Andriukaitis.

Tackling the 88 million tons of food wasted in the EU each year requires involving all key players from public and private sectors in order to better identify, measure, understand, and create solutions to limit food waste, according to the platform. At the meeting, the platform highlighted the role of innovation and research in reaching SDG 12.3 by incorporating voices from EIT Food, a pan-European partnership connecting all stakeholders in the food system to accelerate innovation, and FOOD 2030, an initiative that aims to connect, organize, and scale up research and innovation on food and nutrition security.

As part of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), EIT Food aims to stimulate entrepreneurship, innovation, and research in the food sector to create a more sustainable and future-proof food sector. Their Zero Waste Agenda is one of four innovation programs and aims to develop solutions for food security, improve the efficiency of the food value chain, and reduce food waste. As part of their portfolio to combat food waste, EIT Food currently leads the social awareness campaign “Don’t be a food waster,” which targets all players in the food system—but places specific attention on consumers to educate them and equip them with food waste fighting knowledge and tools.",United States,2018.12
119,"OPINION | Plastic is not our enemy. We need smart policies, not blanket bans: Opinion | News","A common refrain in our culture now is: plastic is evil. After all, plastics are harming marine life and might even be accumulating in our bodies. Canada's governments have committed to some sort of action, but it remains to be seen whether they will use evidence and the lessons learned from today's programs to get the best results, or simply throw more money at approaches that have proven unsuccessful.

Ontario is starting to face that question right now. As part of the new environment plan launched by Environment Minister Rod Phillips, the province has committed to keeping plastics, composites and other packaging materials out of landfills and moving recycling programs to a ""producer responsibility"" model, where industry runs and pays for the system.

The province has set lofty goals of diverting more, consuming less and creating a circular economy. This transition offers an excellent opportunity to focus the entire waste diversion system on what's best for our environment and for individual Canadians — and not just on who pays for it.

Today's system has big problems. Ontario recycling rates have actually trended down for the past three years, but the system's costs keep rising. Since 2002, the cost of operating Ontario's Blue Box system has increased by 214 per cent, ballooning by almost $200 million.

A key factor in those cost increases has been the packaging switch to lightweight and composite plastics (plastic laminates, paper laminates, polystyrene crystal, plastic film such as grocery bags, etc.). Those items make up just over 2 per cent of all Blue Box material recycled in Ontario, but contribute over 16 per cent of overall system costs — $423 million since 2002, with virtually no results. Why? These items are tough to recycle and have little value even if they are.

A popular sentiment is to prohibit the use of these materials, particularly single-use plastics. If they can't really be recycled and are ending up in our landfills, the obvious choice is to ban them, right?

Well, no. A growing body of academic literature paints a more positive picture when you look at the entire lifecycle of those plastics. For starters, they help to reduce food waste by enabling longer shelf lives in stores and in kitchens at home. This means emissions savings from avoided food waste/spoilage, and food source reduction. Lighter and more flexible packaging also mean reduced transportation greenhouse gas emissions, as more material can be safely transported per shipment.

Often times, these savings more than offset the environmental impacts of not being able to recycle those plastics, even when they go to landfill.

Cost impacts on consumers are also important. While it's nice to ""make business pay"" for dealing with the packaging it generates, costs inevitably trickle down to the consumer. This environmental sticker shock is especially important for people in lower-income households, who tend to spend more of their food dollars on packaged products, and who benefit from being able to cut food waste by storing unused food for later.

Governments across Canada face a fundamental policy question: What is the goal of our waste management system? Do we want recycling at any cost, or do we want to maximize environmental outcomes, while keeping costs down for individual Canadians?

As provinces across Canada consider producer responsibility, we need to ensure that policy decisions are rooted in data and evidence, and not emotionally or politically driven narratives. Blanket bans on certain materials and urging consumers to buy less might seem attractive, but the consequences of those decisions could lead to both environmentally and economically undesirable outcomes.

While it may seem counterintuitive, the decision to recycle everything, everywhere, is detrimental to Canadians. Like it or not, the environmental benefits of certain plastics resulting from avoided food waste (cling wrap, freezer bags etc.) can offset the negative impacts of that material ending up in a landfill. While ""zero waste"" and ""circular economy"" are things we should work toward, we must also be practical and pragmatic in our approaches.

Canadians will face tough questions as we move forward – what materials should we prioritize for recovery? How do we encourage waste reduction and reuse? Does all packaging need to be recycled? How do we contain cost? And who will pay for it all? Simply declaring a war on plastics is not the answer.

120,7 ecommerce packaging bombshells in 2018,"News about egroceries, a case for branding, the pros and cons of ecommerce repacking, and Amazon (x4!) prove that online is where the action was at in 2018.

As consumers and businesses do more and more shopping on their laptops, tablets and phones, the need for products—including refrigerated or frozen groceries—to be shipped in packaging optimized for this channel increases.

Here are the top seven ecommerce-packaging-related articles that were posted on PackagingDigest.com in 2018, based on number of page views from our worldwide network of packaging professionals.

7. Report delivers the goods on the egrocery packaging market

Mega-packaging supplier Tetra Pak focused its annual Index study for 2018 on growth and opportunities around egrocery. The research revealed four omni-channel packaging trends:

1. Convenience: This will be the main driver for online consumer take-up, as time-crunched consumers look for new ways to make their life easier. Key opportunities include easy product replenishment, voice ordering and convenient packaging.

2. Sustainability: Pressure on plastic and awareness of the circular economy will continue to grow, and recycling will become ever more important. Consumers want to know whether brands are “doing the right thing.”

3. Personalization and uniqueness: Customization of products and personalization in the consumer journey will be important differentiators going forward. This is accelerating the direct-to-consumer trend and as many as 80% of consumer packaged goods companies are predicted to migrate to this model by 2025.

4. Technology and performance: Super-fast delivery in as little as 10 minutes is expected by 2025, changing consumer behavior to buy more frequently and in smaller amounts, adding more complexity to the logistics. Supply chains will continue to be transformed by a raft of technologies, notably radio-frequency identification (RFID) and robotics, boosting efficiency and transparency.

123,VTT's roadmap towards a sustainable economy,"The circular economy alone is not adequate to ensure the sufficiency of raw materials and energy as natural resources become scarcer due to growing consumption and climate change. The direction must be towards a sustainable economy in which materials and related information and value circulate together for as long as possible. The circular economy is evolving from utilising waste and side streams towards a material circulation which is smart, innovative and value preserving. The value of materials will increase when they are provided as services. VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland's roadmap highlights the need for the energy system transition, and emphasises the atmosphere as a raw material reserve of the future.

The circular economy will come about when we move from waste treatment and recycling to long-term circulation and design out waste. A material may 'visit' several cycles during its life span, occasionally changing its form. A textile fibre could be part of a plastic product, for example, in the next stage of its cycle.

""When designing a material circulation a comprehensive vision of when and how the material or product should be reused and when it should be incinerated and the released energy and fuel gases utilised as raw materials for new materials and chemicals. Recycling by force cannot be the goal, as collection, sorting and processing require a great deal of energy,"" points out Raija Lantto, Principal Investigator at VTT.

Above all, we need increased energy efficiency and emission-free energy solutions. In the long term, we will move from using energy from carbon-containing raw materials - including biomass - to carbon-free energy solutions such as solar, wind and wave power, geothermal energy and, under certain conditions, nuclear power, too.

We are living in a period of increasing resource scarcity, while at the same time humanity needs ever more food and water and the rising standard of living in developing countries is creating pressure to increase industrial production and consumption. The shortage of usable raw materials is increasing and their prices are rising. The importance of raw material ownership will be emphasised, which may change the rules of the game. Raw materials and other materials will become services, and consumers will purchase only the right to use them. One question is whether brand owners will be able to change their business models.

How could Finnish forest owners or pulp producers benefit from scarcity and obtain better value for their wood and pulp tonnage in the market by selling wood or pulp as a service? In practice, it will require the possibility to track and identify the raw material and material in global circulation, too. When a product comes to the end of its intended use, it will be steered by means of digital data to its next use. Initially, these solutions will admittedly be seen only in valuable materials and products: possibly in the circulation of rare and valuable metals, for example.

Material traceability and value preservation as well as various digital platform solutions and servitisation will have a key role in developing the circular economy into a sustainable one. The solutions will be used to do business and conclude agreements on the transfer of ownership or possession of raw materials, materials and products. Methods must be developed to encourage consumers to keep their products in circulation for as long as possible, while preserving their value. When incinerated with mixed waste, an organic or bio-based product will end up in the lowest level of the value hierarchy, changing into energy and emissions such as carbon dioxide.

We know that 96% of living matter is comprised of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and water; all these are obtained from the atmosphere. When we learn to capture these molecules in a controlled and efficient manner, we will be able to make chemicals, materials and food we need from these and from carbon dioxide emissions. When this succeeds, we will reach a new era in resource sufficiency.

Capturing and utilising atmospheric molecules will be an energy-intensive, expensive process. Therefore, an economically viable system to produce sustainable energy in sufficient amounts is a central prerequisite.

Adequate nutrition for humanity will be secured by solutions enabling food to be produced unlimited by time or place. We will be able to manufacture proteins, fats, carbohydrates and vitamins using cells in reactors from the raw materials provided by the atmosphere.

124,Plastics and packaging 1 on 1 with Dow Chemical Part 2,"PlasticsToday continues our interview with Nathan Wiker, Dow’s Global Market Lead and North America Group Marketing Director, about the circular economy, movement towards clean packaging, activity in rigid and flexible packaging, premiumization and an exciting new product.

Tell us more about Dow’s efforts for a circular economy.

Wiker: Dow is completely committed to making sure that our products and our industry and value chain are as circular as possible.

We see that one size does not fit all; it’s not one type of package going through the supply chain and coming back as the same package—there are other end-use markets that can benefit from recycling. We also look at things like chemical recycling or feedstock recycling as part of the equation.

We’re looking at the design, we’re looking at the end use, we’re looking at developing new end use markets, and we’re looking at different coalitions to make that happen.

The Hefty EnergyBag program advances Dow’s vision of a circular economy by demonstrating that energy recovery for plastic waste is a viable, self-sustaining way to divert more plastics from landfills for reuse. The program is an innovative initiative that collects hard-to-recycle plastics and converts them into valuable energy resources. It is a significant step in achieving positive long-term environmental and economic advantages, including reusing plastics to create valuable energy resources and reducing tons of plastics that end up in landfills.

In 2017, 35 Dow volunteers participated in local improvement activities in an effort to clean up facilities, paint classrooms and install green lighting in Cartagena, Colombia. The project, in conjunction with Dow and Conceptos Plásticos, Rochester School, the City Secretary of Education, and Fundación Mamonal, responded to the need to develop educational infrastructure in a sustainable way. The project consisted in the construction of two sustainable classrooms that can accommodate up to 30 students, through the use of recycled plastic. To support the initiative, Dow led a plastic waste collection effort with employees and customers resulting in the collection of 14 tons of plastic, which were then processed by Conceptos Plásticos to produce the blocks used to build the classrooms.

Read more about these efforts here.

Later in 2017, with a goal to reduce marine debris and advance a circular economy, Dow Packaging and Specialty Plastics (P&SP), joined efforts with The Indonesian Aromatic & Plastic Olefin Industry Association (INAPLAS); Indonesia Plastic Recycling Association (ADUPI); PT Polytama Propindo (Indonesia PP Manufacturing); the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) and the Indonesian government to further develop the country’s environmentally friendly plastic road building project.

This project aimed to help the Indonesian government reach its goal of reducing plastics waste in the ocean by 70% by 2025.

Read more about these efforts here.

We’ve noted that the clean labeling trend for foods has extended beyond that to clean packaging where additives or compounds like bisphenol-A (BPA) create uncertainty even if deemed safe by science. Can you comment on packaging polymers that can maintain consumers’ trust?

Wiker: In regards to the contents of the package, you certainly see fewer ingredients and more ingredients that people can pronounce even if they’re still chemicals.

However, those products actually require higher-tech packaging because as brands add fewer preservatives, they need the package to do more for the shelf life through higher barrier materials. That brings into play polymers like a Surlyn or an Infinity Sealant. Granola is a good instance where we can make that package barrier with an ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) layer, but through Retain, still have that recyclability.

For example, polyethylene is an inert material that doesn’t have a lot of negative aspects in terms of additives; you mentioned BPA, even if it’s not scientifically proven to be unhealthy. We keep that in mind as we design new resins to make sure that we’re not introducing anything that could be of potential concern.

What are you seeing in the growth and dynamics between rigid plastics and flexible packaging?

Wiker: Consumers continue to see the benefits of flexible packaging from an overall weight perspective and greenhouse gas emission perspective, and we’re designing new packaging that makes it even thinner and provides ever-longer shelf life.

An example is from meat and cheese packaging where brands change from a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) film-wrapped tray to modified atmosphere packaging and now to vacuum-skin packaging that’s enabled by products like Surlyn. That trend will continue because a growing number of shops no longer have butcher shops in-house as they move to more efficient centralized butchering, and that means a longer shelf life is needed and the only way to do that is through advanced packaging.

We also see growth on the rigid packaging side in different markets including beverage, which is a key growing segment for us. We have a large caps and closures portfolio with the EVERCAP line of closure resins.

We realize the benefit of some rigid packaging in end of life issues, and what we’re trying to extend to flexible packaging is that curbside infrastructure is working to make sure that flexibles are just as easy to recycle.

We also are aware of frustration-free packaging, and that can sometimes mean that consumers can just drop it off on the curb to be recycled versus having to take it back into the store. That’s a viable option with packaging that carries the How2Recycle label. We’re continuing to work with industry partners to make that easier on the flexible packaging side.

What other issues are worth pointing out to our audience?

Wiker: We continue to talk about the Total Package a reaction to the fact that Dow is by far the broadest supplier to the packaging market. Flexible plastic packaging is consistently the right choice for durable, safe and convenient food and beverage packaging as seen in our video. Our Total Package has been strengthened with the DuPont merger. Before, Dow had string portfolio in resins, laminates and adhesives, which uniquely positioned our competence in understanding those interactions to produce a more effective Total Package. Add on DuPont’s copolymers with brands like Surlyn and Bynel and others that aren’t just iconic in name, but iconic in performance, and bring significant benefits to the package as we come together. And we’re planning to spin off to the new Dow in April.

Also, one of the products we’re highlighting now is our Opulux Matte coating. It provides a unique matte finish appearance with the haptics of soft touch in addition to benefits of heat resistance for package process-ability sealing. Notably, it’s a water-based formulation that avoids some issues around solvent-based lacquers and coatings.

It’s something we’re excited about that addresses the trend in premiumization where we see that as more and more entrants into retail and ecommerce want to differentiate the package more and more.

Soft-touch packaging is appropriate for a lot of different applications including dog food, a category that’s experienced a lot of premiumization.

Another market is for natural snacks, because both a matte finish and soft touch tells consumers “this is different.”

Opulux is appropriate for any brand that wants to stand out in a specific category.

Lastly, can you give a hint as to what’s in Dow’s pipeline that excites you?

Wiker: I can mention one that’s not quite to North America, but it’s coming. It’s something we’ve leveraged it out of Asia Pacific—what we call Tenter Frame Biaxially Oriented Polyethylene or TE-BOPE, which is a replacement for biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP).

Orienting PE yields significantly better clarity and abuse performance and with much higher stiffness than a typical PE—properties that open up significant new design flexibilities.

In Asia Pacific they’ve launched this very successfully under our INNATE brand. We do not make the film, we’re still making the resin that’s suitable for this process.

And that resin is available now. We’re identifying specific partners who can convert that into the TE-BOPE brand of film and are also working with various brand owners in the U.S. and around the globe.

Addendum: TE-BOPE was one of six innovative technologies from Dow recognized with R&D 100 Awards on November 16, 2018, by R&D Magazine, two of which were polyolefins. The awards identify and celebrate the top 100 revolutionary technologies introduced during the past year. The two are:

Tenter Frame Biaxially Oriented Polyethylene (TF-BOPE) film is a new addition to the INNATE Precision Packaging Resin family that provides higher mechanical properties and material rigidity, along with better optical and printing performance. Compared to traditional PE products, TF-BOPE can achieve up to 80% less haze, twice the impact strength, twice the tensile modulus, three times the puncture resistance and three times the tensile strength.

ENGAGE PV Polyolefin Elastomers: As the global photovoltaic (PV) market continues to grow, material selection can be a critical component in the ongoing success of PV module manufacturers. ENGAGE PV Polyolefin Elastomers (POEs) help make the choice for PV encapsulant films easier with opportunities for exceptional long-term performance, reliability, and lower overall energy cost.

128,We need to change the way we live,"An interview with Ireland’s Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment

What do you think is the most pressing environmental issue today and why?

Ireland recognizes that climate change, which interacts with so many other aspects of the environment, such as biodiversity loss, is the great global threat for this century. However, we must not ignore all the other aspects of environmental protection, such as air quality and waste management.

What do you think are some of the practical ways to address it?

We need to change the way we live. The Government of Ireland is seeking to ensure an integrated approach to leading this change. For example, the Minister for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has obtained Government approval to develop an all of Government plan to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change, rather than a follower. This plan will include actions across Government to help us reach our climate goals.

It is critical that we engage every individual, community, company, and public body, in addressing these climate goals, and other environmental goals. The National Dialogue on Climate Action, launched in 2017, engages and motivates local communities to address climate change challenges through a series of regional gatherings held across the country. At the household level, one aspect of addressing residential energy efficiency and fuel poverty has been to provide short-term financial assistance towards home improvements that will lead to long-term environmental, health and financial benefits. Also, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has invested nearly 3 million euros in education and awareness campaigns around how to recycle and compost correctly at home.

Raising awareness is only possible where evidence is available to back up the message. The Environmental Protection Agency’s Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme, to which the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is providing 5 million euros, aims to double the number of air quality monitoring stations across the country by 2022, compared to 2017. This will enhance understanding of air quality issues in Ireland and greatly improve the flow of real time information about air quality to the public.

Which is more important, increasing our standard of living or protecting the planet? Is it possible to achieve both?

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development requires the integration of economic, social and environmental progress. Thus, increasing our standard of living goes hand in hand with protecting the planet. To achieve this, in Ireland we will align national policy with the Sustainable Development Goals. Also, actions to simultaneously increase our standard of living and protect the planet are built into the National Development Plan 2018-2027 and the National Planning Framework 2040. For example, the Climate Action Fund, launched in 2018, will provide 500 million euros to support climate action projects, offering potential for innovative interventions that would otherwise not be introduced. The Disruptive Technology Fund encourages enterprise-driven partnerships in areas such as smart and sustainable food production and processing, and decarbonizing the energy system. Innovative environmental technologies, the circular economy and the bio-economy, all offer possibilities for economic gain, allowing increases in standard of living, in parallel with environmental protection. Such approaches include the development of novel sensors for monitoring air or water quality, the reuse of goods previously seen as waste and the production of renewable energy and products needed for nutrition, construction, etc. from biological sources, reducing the exploitation of fossil fuels. The impact of these innovations on local standard of living can be particularly valuable in areas where there traditionally have been fewer employment opportunities, as is the case of the link between the bio-economy and the rural economy.

In Ireland, we recognize that acting nationally is critical, but also that there is a need for coordinated actions at a global scale. That is why we are proud to contribute to the UN Environment Fund.

131,A Circular Economy: The Advantage of Getting Involved Early,"PARIS — Something to chew over: As consumers rethink the eco-impact of apparel, demand in the U.S. for resale could outgrow demand for fast fashion by 2027. That’s one of the predictions of ThredUp, which alongside platforms like The Real Real and Poshmark continues to capture market share as just one layer of fashion’s evolution towards a circular economy. The company has processed 60 million unique items to date and runs what it claims is the largest garment-on-hangar facility in the world, based in Pennsylvania.

With an estimated 53 million tons of clothing thrown away every year; apparel consumption expected to double by 2025, and demand for an ever faster and slicker supply chain putting pressure all the way along the links, the heat is on to develop solutions for reducing reliance on virgin materials, experts say.

As fashion lags behind other industries, projects like Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Circular Fibres Initiative are bringing together all of the players — from technology solutions to brands and governments — to help send out the message that change is needed.

“All of the existing recycling we do in other materials, it just hasn’t happened with textiles, and there’s a growing awareness that we need solutions. The challenge is that gap between where the world is at today and when the technologies will be scaled,” said Cyndi Rhoades, founder of Worn Again Technologies, which is part of a crop of regenerative raw materials technology firms spearheading solutions for making new clothes from non-rewearable clothing and textiles in lieu of virgin resources. Peers include Re:newcell in Sweden and Evrnu in the U.S. Each has its own specialty, with Worn Again the only company capable of extracting both polyester polymers and cellulose from cotton, from non-reusable textiles, PET bottles and packaging which are then turned back into new textile raw materials as part of a continual cycle.

H&M figures among its backers and Kering was one of the earliest supporters of the company which is on its way to opening its first industrial plant.

“We are replacing virgin, and those two markets — cellulose and PET — are massive. Even if we built plants as quickly as we could, we’d still have a hard time denting that market,” Rhoades said. “As and when the technologies that can enable circular recycling of raw materials go to market, the demand is going to majorly outstrip supply.”

Though the major PET producers for polyester are all looking at their own recycling technologies or are partnering with circular economy pioneers, the shift is not expected to happen overnight. Challenges include the general perception that more sustainable outputs come with a higher cost, Rhoades explained.

“For circular materials to go mainstream, producers have to compete on price divergence. That’s what we’re trying to overcome, and that’s what the industry is crying out for,” added Rhoades who predicts the major raw material suppliers will start upgrading to the new sustainable processes within the next 10 years.

Instead, she is seeing a lot of interest from the smaller, more agile firms “who want to be ahead of the game and recognize there’s a competitive advantage to getting involved now.” Whereas the large-scale giants might be a bit later to the game due to investments in machinery for virgin production, “they all are absolutely looking now and understanding that the market is calling out for it, and that they will be required to change,” Rhoades said. “What that change looks like will be interesting to follow over the coming years.”

Francois Souchet, who leads the Circular Fibers Initiative at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, agreed that manufacturers and brands have no choice but to adapt.

The picture of current manufacturing processes “calls for significant improvements,” he said, citing among circular economy pioneers Lenzing, which recently introduced its breakthrough Refibra technology. Billed as the first cellulose fiber featuring recycled material on a commercial scale, the fiber is based on cotton scraps and wood.

Other pioneering initiatives include Novetex’s partnering with H&M and the Hong Kong Research Institute of Textiles and Apparel on upcycling pilot plants in Hong Kong with the goal of including at scale recycled fibers in their manufacturing processes.

“But that doesn’t mean that the people who are currently working in those industries will be out of a job. It’s more about a change of practices,” he noted. “What we are seeing is often the companies that are making those virgin materials are the ones who have the most interest in innovating so they can be leading the supply for secondary materials.”

The appetite for secondhand goods, meanwhile, fueled by a “dramatic change in behavior toward ownership from younger generations happy to access product they want when they want,” will also impact all the different parts of the value chain for the better, he predicts.

A move toward an industry where there’s an interest in using products more, as one of the facets of circularity, “implies the quality of the product needs to be higher and as such you want to make it in a good way, rather than as fast and as cheaply as possible.

“We believe that by transitioning to a circular economy, where clothes are made from safe and renewal materials and are worn longer because they are better made and never become waste, also generates the opportunity to improve the conditions within the supply chain,” he said.

“Something has to give. Ultimately, where everything will shake out is there will be winners and losers in this,” commented James Reinhart, cofounder and chief executive officer of ThredUp. Citing his own company’s collaboration with Reformation, and The Real Real’s recent hook-up with Stella McCartney, Reinhart predicts the next decade will see deeper integration between the second-hand arena and retailers.

“If you look at the auto market, there was a time when used car vendors were something off the parking lot, something done on the side. Now it’s very clear that manufacturers and car dealers sell just as many used cars — certified pre-owned — as they do new cars, both of these things work together. The same thing is true in electronics. If you wanted to find something used, you went to these obscure secondary markets, but now you can walk into any mobile phone store and find refurbished phones or tablets,” he said. “[For the fashion industry], this kind of disruption will play out over time, and it will be interesting to watch.”",United States,2018.12
133,Unlocking additional value from soybeans via the circular economy,"Unlocking additional value from soybeans via the circular economy

Okara is usually used as animal feed or as compost/fertiliser, and excess okara is simply disposed of. Soy whey, on the other hand, is produced in large quantities through tofu production and soy-protein isolate production, and this nutritious liquid side-stream is often disposed of via the sewage system, which can result in water pollution. Scientists from the National University of Singapore (NUS), however, have found ways to convert these two by-products into value-added consumer products using zero-waste biotransformation.

Okara can be transformed into a food ingredient with improved functionality, as well as a probiotic beverage, while soy whey can be fermented into a first-of-its-kind alcoholic beverage with a Japanese sake-like flavour profile. As such, more value can be unlocked from the same amount of soybeans used to manufacture soymilk and tofu, thereby contributing to the creation of a resource-efficient, circular economy in the food industry.

Soybeans are an important source of protein in the Asian diet, especially for vegetarians. There is a rising trend in consumption levels of soybean products around the world, largely attributable to their excellent nutritional characteristics, as well as the potential health benefits associated with them. Some of the reported health benefits include lowered risks of atherosclerosis, cancer, hypertension, osteoporosis, hypocholesterolaemia and even alleviation of postmenopausal symptoms for women. Commercial soybean products can be generally classified into two main groups: fermented and unfermented soybean products. Unfermented soybean products consist mainly of soymilk, soy powder and tofu (soybean curd), while fermented soybean products include a variety of products that are unique to different countries. Fermented soybean products have a longer history and are widely consumed in Asia. For example, Japan is famous for its natto, miso and shoyu; Indonesia for its tempeh; Korea for its chungkookjang and doenjang; and China for its stinky tofu, sufu and douchi.

In the soybean products industry, soymilk and tofu are two of the most common products found in supermarkets. During the production of soymilk, soaked soybeans and water are blended together before being ground and filtered, and this process generates soybean pulp – commonly known as okara – as a by product. It is estimated that more than four million metric tons of okara are produced every year, with China generating more than 50 percent of the global okara output, and Japan producing approximately 20 percent. Currently, okara is commonly used as compost or animal feed, and excess okara is disposed of as waste.

To produce tofu, soymilk is brought to a boil, and a coagulant (either singly or in combination) is added, which results in the formation of a gel-like structure (soybean curd – Figure 1). The soybean curds are subjected to various degrees of pressing to form the different types of tofu that are available to consumers (Figure 1).

During the pressing process, soy (tofu) whey is generated, which is also disposed of, usually into the sewage system. As okara and soy whey both contain substantial amounts of nutrients, such as protein and isoflavones, scientists have thus conducted research into utilising these two by-products.

Existing technologies for utilisation of okara and soy whey

Okara may be dried for use as an ingredient in baked products. However, as it has high moisture levels, the corresponding high costs of drying may not be justified, especially if the dried okara is used in products with low profit margins.

Okara is also susceptible to putrefaction; so it must be refrigerated, frozen or dried within hours of production if further use is desired. Moreover, the high levels of insoluble dietary fibre in okara give a gritty mouthfeel, while its particulate nature makes it hard to bind together. These features limit the amount of okara that can be incorporated into food products, as adding too much will produce a food product with an undesirable, crumbly and fragile texture. For this reason, okara is usually used as compost or animal feed, or disposed of; however none of these approaches realise or recover the true value of okara. While the extraction of soy protein and/or dietary fibre (largely insoluble) from okara is possible, the spent cake constitutes yet another waste stream.

Soy whey possesses a different nutritional makeup to okara, largely consisting of water and low amounts of sugars, proteins and isoflavones.

The nutrients present in soy whey can be extracted for various applications (eg, for use as functional food additives, albeit with low yield and high cost) and the remaining liquid substrate disposed of. Soy whey contains sufficient levels of nutrients to support the growth of microorganisms, and various research outcomes have shown that it can be used as a medium to cultivate beneficial microorganisms, such as fungi and bacteria. Some of these microorganisms are cultivated for the bioproduction of materials such as nisin (a natural antimicrobial compound), citric acid and biohydrogen. However, most of the processes involved still generate significant amounts of waste product – in fact, the number of technologies that are capable of utilising the entirety of soy whey is very limited.

Bioprocessing these soy-based byproducts using enzymes and microorganisms is one way of adding value and returning them to the food chain (Figure 2).

Rhizopus oligosporus is a fungus typically used to ferment whole soybeans to make tempeh, a type of traditional Indonesian food. Tempeh is well loved by vegetarians and vegans for its chewy texture and slightly meaty taste. Researchers from the Food Science and Technology Programme of the National University of Singapore (NUS) have fermented okara with the same fungus and a yeast, Yarrowia lipolytica. The final product obtained from this fermentation, called ‘bio-okara’, has an even stronger meaty, cheese-like taste, and contains a higher amount of dietary fibre than soybean tempeh. Moreover, bio-okara contains only one-third of the amount of insoluble dietary fibre of okara, as well as a higher amount of isoflavone aglycones, which are more easily absorbed by humans. The dried bio-okara is therefore an improved functional ingredient that can be added to baked goods, cereals and meatballs, to enhance their taste and nutrition without adversely affecting their textures. The team is currently exploring various applications and investigating possible clinical benefits of this functional ingredient.

Alternatively, okara can also be used to create a first-of-its-kind co-cultured probiotic beverage, using a commercial probiotic Lactobacillus paracasei LAFTI L26, and Lindnera saturnus yeast. This patented beverage product contains live probiotics (at least 100 billion per serving), dietary fibre, as well as double the amount of free amino acids and isoflavone aglycones compared to untreated okara. These nutrients are documented to support gut health, digestion, cardiovascular health and are easily absorbed by the human body. The natural fruity aroma and refreshing sour taste of this drink is a product of the selected mix of probiotic and yeast. Probiotic viability is also enhanced by the use of co-cultures; this drink can be stored at ambient temperatures for up to eight weeks, while still maintaining an adequate amount of live probiotics (more than one billion per serving). In contrast, most of the current commercial probiotic beverages, such as yoghurts and cultured milk drinks, are of dairy origin and require cold chain distribution, and cannot withstand temperature abuse. Furthermore, this vegan-friendly probiotic drink is produced in a streamlined process within 24 hours or less. Such features appeal not only to consumers and food companies, but also environmentalists, as the okara is utilised in its entirety with no waste produced.

No research has thus far been carried out to explore the feasibility of converting soy whey into an alcoholic beverage. Researchers from NUS undertook experiments to bridge this research gap, and they have subsequently developed a patented fermentation technology that is capable of turning the entirety of soy whey into a first-of-its-kind alcoholic beverage. The resulting soy alcoholic beverage contains seven per cent alcohol-by-volume (ABV), and has a flavour profile similar to Moscato and Japanese sake, which was achieved without the use of any flavour additives. The fermentation technique is also versatile, in that it can be modified to produce a 14 percent ABV soy alcoholic beverage with a profile

similar to that of white wine. During the fermentation process, the isoflavones present in the soy whey are modified into forms that are easily absorbed by the human body when consumed. This fermentation technique creates a new, zero-waste method of utilising a low-cost by-product, where it can be converted into value added consumer beverage products. This new category of alcoholic beverage has been named Sachi, which in the Japanese language refers to the ‘blossoming of wisdom’.

The novel methods developed by the scientists at NUS to utilise okara and soy whey have created new opportunities for soymilk and tofu producers to utilise their by-products. By using these by-products, additional value can be extracted from the same amount of soybeans presently used to manufacture soymilk and tofu, thereby contributing towards the creation of a resource-efficient, circular economy in the soymilk and tofu manufacturing industries. The development of these technologies can serve as a stepping stone for the creation of new food products from other food processing by-product.",United States,2018.12
136,Groups present recycling technology research roadmap,"A European chemicals and plastics industry report identifies technology developments needed to help usher in a circular economy for plastics.

The 29-page document, “Plastics Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda in a Circular Economy,” was released by the European Technology Platform for Sustainable Chemistry (SusChem). Founded by six different industry groups in Europe, SusChem describes itself as a forum to bring together businesses, academia, policymakers and others to use chemical sciences to solve societal problems.

The report takes a wide-ranging look at technologies for boosting the sustainability of plastics, breaking the topic down into three broad categories: improving the chemistry of plastics, boosting recycling and incorporating alternative feedstocks.

The recycling section speaks to the need for a wide variety of technologies in the areas of feedstock preparation, sorting and separation. It also discusses different recycling approaches (mechanical, chemical, thermal, thermochemical and multi-layer/compound recycling) and post-processing. It further categorizes the technologies based on whether they’re expected to have a low, medium, or high impact.

Those anticipated to have a high impact on recycling include processes for removing contaminants, inks and odors. Plastics Recycling Update has previously written about a couple of the technologies suggested, including de-inking and use of supercritical carbon dioxide to remove odors.

The document also suggests pretreating multi-layer films by immersing them in chemical solutions and breaking down polyolefins via catalytic depolymerization. Additionally, the paper notes that implementing an international standard for polymer structures would greatly help with recycling.

The document was published on Dec. 6 by SusChem, European Plastics Converters (EuPC), European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC), PlasticsEurope, and the European Composites, Plastics and Polymer Processing Platform (ECP4), all of which contributed to the research.

“The report presents a shared vision, demonstrates how collaboration within the plastic value chain will be a driving force for change, and outlines the future research needs required to fulfil the objectives of the European Plastic Strategy,” according to EuPC. “The technology solutions described are part of an integral approach to make the entire plastics production more circular.”

141,Taipei-Shanghai Forum Puts Ko Wen-je’s China Views Into Focus,"A 135-member delegation from Shanghai helmed by Executive Vice Mayor Zhou Bo has arrived in Taipei to participate in a twin-city forum from December 19 to 21.

The Taipei-Shanghai twin-city forum, which has been held since 2010 and alternates between the two cities, comes amid suspicion over Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je’s alleged warmth toward Beijing ahead of a potential presidential run in 2020.

Ko, an independent, won re-election on November 24 in a surprisingly close race. The nationwide elections saw large-scale gains for the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), which favors reunification with China. Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which favors eventual independence, had gradually distanced itself from Ko after his comments at the 2015 twin-city forum in Shanghai that the “two sides of the [Taiwan] Strait are one family.”

Despite this, Ko announced the date of this year’s forum just after his election victory. The 2018 event will focus on circular economy initiatives, a hallmark policy of Ko and national DPP leaders alike and a contributor to Taiwan’s success in reducing waste and improving the country’s recycling rate. Officials will also discuss culture, urban renovation, and environmental matters, according to the Taipei city government.

The chatter surrounding the forum, however, has focused not on waste reduction schemes but on the potential motives of its participants.

On December 18, as the first Shanghai officials touched down in Taipei, People’s Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft and warships were spotted just outside Taiwan’s coastal air defense zones for the first time since June. This came just after a defiant speech by Chinese President Xi Jinping in which he told the world Beijing remained “resolutely opposed to Taiwan independence.”

Ko, who is said to be planning a trip to the United States in 2019 ahead of a potential presidential bid, told Bloomberg in October that Taiwan is “just a product on a shelf” for the United States in its trade war with China.

His apparent views contrast heavily with officials in the administration of President Tsai Ing-wen, which has warmed to the U.S. while distancing itself from China.

Taiwan’s incoming KMT mayors have shown interest in potentially replicating the twin-city exchange model pioneered by Shanghai and Taipei, which is traditionally a “deep-blue” (pro-KMT) municipality.

Kaohsiung mayor-elect Han Kuo-yu said he has already formed a working group in his administration to plan for municipal-level exchanges with China based on the principles of the “1992 Consensus” between China and Taiwan. The consensus, which says that both governments agree that there is “one China” but disagree on what that China constitutes, is not recognized by Tsai and the DPP.

The city-level exchanges allow municipal governments to bypass national-level sentiments and establish relations with the cross-strait neighbor, which remains Taiwan’s largest individual trading partner.

In the past, the Taipei forums have produced a relatively mild level of public scorn. They tend to emphasize people-to-people exchanges and economic knowledge-sharing, straying well away from potential political minefields. But Ko’s tepid response to protests at a 2017 cross-strait music festival in Taipei after they were met with violence from alleged pro-unification groups sparked an uproar and ensured the DPP would not support Ko in the 2018 mayoral elections.

Regardless of this, incoming Tainan mayor Huang Wei-che of the DPP recently said he was considering visiting China on a tourism marketing trip, raising the possibility that DPP-ruled cities may pursue their own city-level exchanges.

Ko’s words at the 2018 Shanghai-Taipei twin-city forum will be watched carefully by observers on all sides of Taiwan’s political spectrum.

Lin Fei-fan, a student leader of Taiwan’s 2014 Sunflower Movement, wrote in September that “two sides of the Strait are one family” had become a “pivotal pillar of both Xi’s and China’s Taiwan policy.” Chinese state-run media, he noted, had featured approving coverage of Ko’s re-election campaign. (It has since fawned over Han Kuo-yu’s proposal to initiate city-level exchanges based on the 1992 Consensus.)

Lin expressed concern that municipal leaders such as Ko were playing into the hands of Beijing’s vision of “One China” and that Ko was being used as a wedge – a sentiment sure to be repeated ad nauseam ahead of the 2020 presidential election.

But Ko has never fully articulated a strong position on Taiwan’s broader relationship with China. He irked the then-ruling KMT in 2014 when he questioned the usefulness of the 1992 Consensus, instead calling for “mutual familiarity, understanding, respect and cooperation” between Taiwan and China.

Since taking power in 2016, the DPP has taken an adversarial stance toward Beijing, criticizing China for political interference and drawing closer to Southeast Asian neighbors via Tsai’s signature New Southbound Policy, which aims to decrease Taiwan’s economic reliance on China.

While Tsai has touted the early returns of the policy and has urged Taiwanese companies to relocate from China in response to the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, it remains uncertain whether a large-scale economic pivot away from China and toward Southeast Asia is realistic, much less a viable way to jumpstart Taiwan’s sluggish economy.

Unless Ko manages to land in controversy during this week’s forum, he will likely cement his perception among voters as occupying a middle ground between the DPP and KMT. In a country where over half of voters do not identify with either major political party, that is hardly the worst place to be.",United States,2018.12
143,Dow successfully rallies employees and partners to reduce marine litter with its global campaign #PullingOurWeight Beach Clean-up - Olympic News,"Worldwide TOP Partner Dow, which pledged to join the IOC's Clean Seas movement in May 2018, has helped drive awareness of the marine litter issue with a global campaign involving employees, families, friends and customers of the company in beach and waterway clean-ups around the world.

During the campaign and in collaboration with local organisations across the world and Ocean Conservancy, Dow volunteers have removed no less than 53,931 pounds of waste (24.46 tonnes) from waterways at 57 locations across the globe to bring attention to the issue of ocean plastic pollution.

The clean-up effort – called #PullingOurWeight – challenged participants to remove at least four pounds (1.8kg) of waste per person from local waterways and communities. Four pounds is the average amount of waste that each person on earth produces each day. During the campaign, 5,718 Dow employees, families and friends participated in clean-up events along with industry peers and Dow customers – the largest participation of Dow volunteers for a single cause in company history.

“This year, Dow volunteers have participated in more clean-ups than ever before; and I am so impressed with the level of commitment from our employees around the world and extended Dow family,” said Diego Donoso, President of Dow’s Packaging & Specialty Plastics business. “From Asia to Africa, Europe to the Americas, our clean-ups to date have removed more than 40,000 pounds of trash from local waterways. Dow is #PullingOurWeight for a cleaner, healthier ocean and we encourage others to join us in this movement.”

“Dow has long supported Ocean Conservancy’s International Coastal Clean-up and the organisation’s ocean plastic mitigation efforts,” says Dow CEO Jim Fitterling. “No waste – plastic or otherwise – belongs in the ocean or anywhere in our environment. Through global and local collaborations with governments, NGOs, and other industry leaders, Dow is working to innovate technologies to recycle waste, clean up existing waste and support initiatives that prevent waste from entering the environment.”

While the #Pullingourweight campaign cleared many beaches, its impact lies in the awareness it has created with the broader communities in which Dow operates and educated more people on the importance of managing plastic waste.

In 2019, Dow and the IOC will join efforts with the NOCs and IFs as well as Clean Seas ambassadors to make this campaign even more impactful and inspire people and companies to take action in their daily lives and in their organisations.

Dow is one of the IOC’s partners that committed to support the Clean Seas Campaign launched in January 2017 by the United Nations to increase global awareness of the marine litter issue, and to implement measures that address gaps in waste management.

Marie Sallois-Dembreville, IOC Director of Corporate Development, Brand and Sustainability, commented: “Dow’s clean-up initiative is a clear sign that the company is committed not only to raising awareness of the plastic waste management, but also to driving innovative solutions that the whole of society will benefit from. We are very pleased to have Dow as an active partner, helping us to achieve our sustainability goals”.

 



Dow and the circular economy for plastics

Dow is partnering across the value chain to advance a circular economy for plastics. Poor waste management infrastructure combined with the careless disposal of plastics after they are used have resulted in too much plastic being lost to landfills and the environment. Appropriately managing the lifecycle of plastics from design to disposal will retain the many social and economic benefits of plastics for society without compromising the world’s oceans, rivers or streams.

“Advancing a circular economy is a key component of Dow’s 2025 Sustainability Goals,” stated Fitterling, “It’s clear to us that addressing end-of-life options for plastic waste will be one of the most important business opportunities of our time. Whether recycling plastic to its original state to capture the energy within, or reformulating waste plastics into new products such as footwear, construction materials, clothing or other valuable products – there are viable options that exist now to close-the-loop on plastics.”

For the #PullingOurWeight campaign, Dow and Ocean Conservancy received support from four of Dow’s valued customers through certified collection bags for clean-ups around the world. The bags were made of recycled plastic, and used Dow’s RETAIN compatibiliser technology, demonstrating how science can support closing the loop on material utilisation.

 



As a Worldwide Olympic Partner, the Official Chemistry Company of the Olympic Games, and the Official Carbon Partner of the International Olympic Committee, The Dow Chemical Company combines science and technology knowledge to develop premier materials science solutions that help the IOC deliver its Sustainable Strategy. In addition to providing multiple solutions that enhance the architecture and performance of the IOC’s new headquarters building, Dow is delivering an innovative global carbon mitigation programme to compensate carbon emissions from the IOC's daily operations, as well as other projects within the Olympic Movement.

146,Sourcing challenges and sustaining a “circular economy”: The supplier view,"18 Dec 2018 --- With growing consumer interest in health, sustainability and the ethical aspects of food ingredients, the notion of a “circular economy” and a sustainable supply chain has been in the spotlight this past year. “Circular economy” has been a buzz phrase in 2018 and suppliers are indeed addressing this trend. FoodIngredientsFirst spoke with some key suppliers about current sourcing challenges and how these can be overcome.

Going green is now a given but as 2020 targets draw ever closer, it is high time that actual updates are presented. Showing a company’s green colors is something that today’s “mindful consumer” expects. This is why Innova Market Insights listed Green Appeal as one of its key trends for 2019.

A 2018 Innova Market Insights survey found that 64 percent of US and UK consumers expect companies to invest in sustainability. This market dynamic has inspired product development, with 57 percent average annual growth reported in food & beverage launches with an ethical/environmental claim (Global, 2013-2017).

Ingredients suppliers were also keen to highlight their sustainability credentials since manufacturers and retailers are becoming ever keen to present the carbon footprint of their entire chain: “from farm to fork.”

Creating more value

Givaudan has been investigating circular economy solutions for sometime and Geraldine O’Grady, Sustainability Manager Flavor Division at the company believes in the importance of creating more value for customers and stakeholders through sustainable product development.

“When developing new flavors, we always consider their impact on the environment. We look for new ways to make flavor compounds via natural processes, such as fermentation and use sustainable plant materials,” she says.

There are many different categories of waste across Givaudan’s value chain; packaging waste, side streams from production processes and so on. It’s important for businesses to have a full view of the different kinds of waste, to then be able to identify ways to reduce or eliminate them, according to O’ Grady. “We are all looking to design more circular solutions,” claims O’Grady.

Part of moving toward a circular economy means reducing waste and protecting raw materials, securing the supply chain and guarding against unwanted challenges. Givaudan’s sourcing at Origin initiative involves working with local smallholder farmers, transformers and partners to secure the long-term supply of these ingredients while strengthening the local economic fabric by contributing to more stable incomes for thousands of farmers.

Preventing waste from being a problem in the first place is a crucial facet of circular thinking – in essence, designing processes that have no waste, according to O’Grady. “As a player in the food industry, we recognize that one of the biggest causes of food waste is through food loss during food production, both at the source when it is grown as well as through processing. In looking to a sustainable future for food and feeding a growing world population, it is critical that we minimize food loss, and produce food more efficiently,” she notes.

Corbion recently announced that it has committed to supplying customers with certified sustainable palm-based products, not as an option, but as a standard offering. Now it’s going one step further by signing on as a member of NASPON which was launched in December 2017 by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) to educate, build momentum and assist North American companies in making and delivering on commitments to source sustainable palm oil. This year, the 17 founding members of NASPON – which include Albertsons Companies, Dunkin’ Brands, Grupo Bimbo, Kellogg Company, Kraft Heinz, PepsiCo and Target – have been joined by 15 additional members, among them Aldi, Campbell Soup Company and Colgate-Palmolive Company, along with Corbion.

“So far, we are on track to achieve our target of 100 percent RSPO MB certification of all palm oil and primary oleochemicals globally by 2020. In 2017, 24 percent of our palm oil and primary oleochemicals was RSPO MB-certified globally. Since then, we have been making excellent progress, and when we reach MB certification of all palm-containing products produced at two of our four palm-using U.S. plants in early January, it will be a significant step towards the 2020 target,” says Diana Visser, Senior Director of Sustainability at Corbion. “We began sourcing RSPO-certified products several years ago, which was a good starting point. But we realized that achieving 100 percent conversion would require a lot of teamwork across functions. So last year, we created a multi-disciplinary team that included procurement, R&D, communications, finance and sustainability to develop a roadmap for meeting our 2020 target. The implementation of that plan commenced in 2018.”



For Duijnhouwer-Tomaselli, circular solutions are a key enabler for a circular economy. “They can be a sustainable alternative for ingredients derived from fossil fuels,” she comments. Sustainability has always been at the heart of what Corbion does and the company’s sustainable ingredient solutions are based on renewable resources. Dependence on fossil resources is a major challenge and a serious concern, she stresses. “It is imperative we transition to a circular economy, using renewable resources powered by renewable energy. We feel well-positioned to support customers with this transition. For instance, 98 percent of our products are already bio-based and we’re aiming for 100 percent renewable electricity by 2030, a goal we are confident that we will achieve,” explains Duijnhouwer-Tomaselli.

Production and sourcing

Meanwhile, the “circular economy” is much more than a buzz phrase for Sensient in the company’s production and sourcing processes. Speaking to FoodIngredientsFirst, Dr. Roland Beck, Managing Director Sensient Colors Europe GmbH, says: “We take our environmental responsibility very seriously and all our processes meet ISO Standard 14001. In the area of wider sustainability, Sensient was the first company to launch a range of palm-free natural coloring solutions, all of which perform well in a wide range of applications and avoid the need to use palm oil-based products.”

With the constant sourcing challenge, Sensient adapted its “Seed to Shelf” program which sees the company work closely with growers and seed producers to ensure responsibly sourced materials are readily available for their customers.

“Sensient has a dedicated agronomy program in place supporting best farming practice throughout its supply chain,” adds Dr. Beck.

Coping with environmental challenges

Coralie Garcia-Perrin, Senior Marketing Manager at Kerry Europe, also notes that the environmental challenges of the company’s business model are accelerating rapidly and becoming more and more visible.

As a food ingredients company, Garcia-Perrin believes that part of Kerry’s duties is to find new ways to produce, to develop products to be more respectful of the people and the planet. Kerry has initiated several sustainability programs to deliver on this promise, such as the Tsara Kalitao or RAIN project.

“But we also have several initiatives in our innovation funnel looking at ways to make better use of our waste,” Garcia-Perrin adds. Click to EnlargeCoralie Garcia-Perrin, Senior Marketing Manager at Kerry Europe

One other big challenge is finding the right balance between consumers’ expectations around natural ingredients and the sustainability challenges generated by those expectations, she notes.

What’s next?

As 2018 draws to a close, much has been made of the various sourcing challenges throughout Europe and the rest of the world in recent months, as harvests of several crops have been affected by drought. Europe experienced a dry spell and above-average seasonal temperatures, including many heat waves, in the summer of 2018, and the repercussions may not be truly felt until 2019. Above all, sustainability and moving towards a more “circular economy” will continue be key themes for the coming year, with many suppliers having already highlighted their goals in creating a more transparent supply chain, amid the challenges that lie ahead.

148,Fast Fashion’s Circular Economy Challenge,"PARIS — Acknowledging the darker sides of the apparel business — such as the staggering amounts of clothing that winds up in landfills each year — two of the most popular fast-fashion giants have set ambitious goals.

At this year’s Copenhagen Fashion Summit, Hennes & Mauritz AB said it aims for a circular and renewable business model.

“We don’t know when we will get there or how we will get there,” said Cecilia Strömblad Brännsten, the group’s environmental sustainability manager. This fall, the group said it plans to use only recycled or other sustainably sourced materials by 2030, and only sustainable cotton by 2020.

Spanish rival, Inditex, the owner of Zara, is also focusing on recycled textiles.

“We will not send anything to landfills in 2020,” declared Inditex. The company’s pledge extends to its headquarters, logistics centers, stores and factories. Planned measures to reach the goal include training all of the company’s designers in circular design principles, setting up garment collection in 2,000 stores, bulking up partnerships with local nonprofit organizations to resell used clothing, and using more recycled textiles. The Spanish group, which plans to invest $3.5 million in textile recycling technology by 2020, has also forged partnerships with MIT and Lenzig, an Austria-based pulp and paper mill that has moved into the business of making textiles out of recycled fabrics and sustainably sourced wood fibers.

Such an approach has to go beyond greenwashing, as it is a matter of survival, industry observers stressed.

“We can’t all be producing luxury products — so they need to be there,” said Morten Lehmann, chief sustainability officer of the nonprofit organization Copenhagen Global Fashion Agenda, referring to fast-fashion retailers. H&M is among its members.

“But the only way they can be there is if they become circular. If they become part of a circular system, then they have their place,” he told a seminar held by the Institut Français de la Mode in Paris. In its latest “Pulse of the Fashion Industry Report,” the Copenhagen group noted that the largest entry-priced fashion companies are leading the charge when it comes to sustainability issues.

For Natasha Franck, founder of Eon, a company that is seeking to create a digital marking system for clothing, applying the so-called “Internet of things” — which is basically a type of digital tracking system for objects — is key for brands and retailers seeking a circular model.

“We digitalize the physical world and we use that data to unlock transparency and the circular economy,” she said at a recent retail conference organized in Paris by Microsoft.

“If you can identify assets and track them, you can facilitate sustainable life-cycle management so you can optimize the product use, you can identify the material content of the product to recycle it, you can introduce legislation that effects the taxation around the resources of that material if not recycled, so it creates a whole global logistics operation that’s essential for sustainable life-cycle management,” she added.

The idea would be to attach a tracking system to clothing that offers information such as the makeup of the fabric, or where it is from.

According to Franck, one of the first hurdles to such a system was physical: Today’s metal RFID tags are a bit impractical to attach to a blouse, and most of them usually come off at the point of sale, she explained. So Eon created an RFID tag in the form of a thread, thus invisible and washable, she explained.

The challenge now is to come up with a system to which brands and retailers can adhere.

“A crucial next step is widely accepted standards, and in order to create that you need brands and retailers coming together to define that,” she said. The executive sees the push by retailers into the digital sphere as likely helping the industry on this front.

“In terms of business value, this is really the key for many brands in terms of their omnichannel strategy, their personalization, their ability to engage with customers after point of sale, even the tracking throughout the entire supply chain…the digital ID actually acts as a bridge between all these fragmented initiatives or technology-focused work,” she said.

In the meantime, H&M has installed sewing machines in some stores as it tests services like customizing apparel with hems or patches to expand the lifespan of clothing, while Inditex sends used clothing and fabric scraps to organizations like Caritas, Oxfam and the Red Cross for reselling or recycling.

In a promotional video by Inditex, the company acknowledges that the company’s role in the life of an item of clothing stops at its stores: “From now on our stores won’t be just the end. They’ll also be the beginning: a second chance for used clothes,” it says.

Lehmann notes that the larger players tend to face the most pressure.

“We are always asking the best in the industry what they are doing and it’s fair. They’re out there and we see them; they’re huge and have a huge impact,” he said.

Then he added: “We should…also ask those brands that are not taking center stage.”",United States,2018.12
150,"NES moves to create awareness on circular economy, environmental governance","In other to brace up the activities of the environment sector, the National Environmental Standards and regulations enforcement agency has said that it will create awareness and foster an understanding of the concepts, elements of circular economy, environmental governance.

152,Packaging producers to pay full recycling costs under waste scheme,"Retailers and producers of packaging will be forced to pay the full cost of collecting and recycling it under the government’s new waste strategy.

Supermarkets and other retailers could be charged penalties for putting difficult to recycle packaging – such as black plastic trays – on the market as part of the strategy, which aims to make the “polluter pay”. They would be charged lower fees for packaging that was easy to reuse or recycle.

As the Guardian revealed last month, costs to retailers and producers will soar under the plans, to between £500m and £1bn annually.

It will see the producers of the waste cover the full costs of recycling and collecting it. Currently the taxpayer, through local authorities, funds 90% of the costs of recycling and businesses just 10%. The scheme could also see retailers and producers pay for the cost of clearing up the litter created by their waste and for the enforcement of the scheme.

Launched on Tuesday by the environment secretary, Michael Gove, the government’s waste strategy embraces leading EU policies on the circular economy just as the UK prepares to quit the bloc.

As well as forcing producers to pay millions of pounds more towards the collection and recycling of their packaging waste, the strategy tackles plastic pollution and food waste.
• Introduce a tax on single use plastic with less than 30% recycled content.
• Consider banning plastic packaging where there are alternatives.
• Legislate to allow government to specify a core set of materials to be collected by all local authorities and waste operators.
• Commit to a deposit return scheme for bottles and cans.

But critics are angry at the time it is taking the government to implement measures such as the deposit return scheme for plastic bottles and cans.

“It is great to see further commitments to introduce a deposit return system for cans and bottles, which is tried, tested and proven to boost recycle rates to over 90%,” said Samantha Harding, litter programme manager at the Campaign to Protect Rural England.

“However, the rollout of such a system may not happen for another five years. With the Scottish government expected to introduce its deposit system by 2020, and the packaging producers – who would pay for the system – wanting it to be UK-wide, why does our government think it would take a further three years to get in line?”

The government says the new strategy will consider “appropriate enforcement measures” targeted at the public, to nudge people to “do the right thing.”

“Together we can move away from being a throwaway society to one that looks at waste as a valuable resource,” said Gove.

“We will cut our reliance on single-use plastics, end confusion over household recycling, tackle the problem of packaging by making polluters pay, and end the economic, environmental and moral scandal that is food waste.”

The government will put the plans for making producers pay for the net cost of the collection and recycling of their packaging out to consultation shortly. This type of system is already in place in other European countries such as Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.

The strategy states: “‘Extended producer responsibility’ (EPR) is a powerful environmental policy approach through which a producer’s responsibility for a product is extended to the post-use stage. This incentivises producers to design their products to make it easier for them to be re-used, dismantled and/or recycled at end of life.

“It has been adopted in many countries around the world, across a broad range of products, to deliver higher collection, recycling and recovery rates.”

The strategy aims to see less of the UK’s waste being exported abroad – a market which is open to abuse and fraud and in crisis after China banned the import of plastic waste and other countries started to follow suit.

Simon Ellin, of the Recycling Association, welcomed the strategy. He said: “It ticks most of the boxes we have asked for – full cost producer responsibility, consistent local authority collections and labelling, food waste reductions, focus on waste crime.

“There is a little bit too much consultation involved before delivery and therefore the chance the polices could get watered down.”

The Green Alliance was also positive. A spokesperson said: “The positive steps include ensuring producers are made to pay for the waste they create and giving households access to the consistent, high-quality recycling and food waste collections that we have been calling for. These proposals must now translate into policy, fully supported by other departments and sufficient funding. And the warm words on resource efficiency must become concrete action.”

But Mary Creagh, chair of the environmental audit committee, said there was not enough immediacy about the policies.

155,American Manganese develops technology for battery recycling,"According to figures released by the Association of Plastic Recyclers (APR) and the American Chemistry Council (ACC), both based in Washington, plastic bottle recycling declined by 3.6 percent to 2.8 billion pounds in 2017. The 28th annual ""National Postconsumer Plastic Bottle Recycling Report"" indicates the overall recycling rate for plastic bottles for the year was 29.3 percent, a decline of 0.4 percentage points from 29.7 percent in 2016.



The five-year compounded annual growth rate for plastic bottle recycling was 0.1 percent, according to the associations.

Among the factors that that contributed to the decline were changing export markets and a 3.6 percent drop in material collected for recycling, the report notes. Ongoing increases in single-stream collection also led to increased contamination of recyclables. In addition, growth in the use of plastic in bottles was offset by continuing progress in lightweighting and increased use of concentrates, which are packaged in smaller and lighter bottles.

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles collected for recycling decreased by 27 million pounds for a total of 1,726 million pounds in 2017, the report notes, while high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles declined even more steeply. Slightly more than 1 billion pounds of bottles of this type were collected, which is 70.3 million pounds, or 6.3 percent less, than in 2016. The recycling rate for HDPE bottles slipped from 33.4 percent to 31.1 percent in 2017, the report notes.

Exports of HDPE bottles fell nearly 28 percent from 193 million pounds to 140 million pounds, or 13.4 percent of total HDPE bottles collected in 2017. According to the report, the processing of recycled HDPE sourced domestically and imported fell by 31 million pounds in 2017.

Despite the declines, Steve Alexander, APR president, says, “Plastic bottle recycling is proving to be resilient in the face of short-term challenges. The recycling industry is responding in kind, with some investing in increased U.S. infrastructure, a clear sign of a positive long-term outlook. These investments underscore the need for continued consumer participation and convenient access to recycling programs.”

“Increasing plastics recycling is a critical part of moving toward a more circular economy, and commitments made across the value chain—from brand owners to plastics makers to recyclers—give us good reason to be optimistic about the long-term prospects for plastics recycling,” says Steve Russell, ACC vice president of plastics. “Plastics makers in North America and Europe have committed to recycle or recover all plastic packaging by 2040.”

This year’s survey found the collection of polypropylene (PP) bottles fell 15.2 percent to 31.1 million pounds, as the PP collection rate dropped to 17.2 percent. PP caps, closures and nonbottle containers are widely collected for recycling in the United States, and these data are presented in a separate report on recycling nonbottle rigid plastics, which will be released in the coming months.

Together, PET and HDPE bottles make up 97 percent of the U.S. market for plastic bottles, with PP comprising 1.9 percent; low-density polyethylene (LDPE), 0.7 percent; and PVC, 0.3 percent. Together, PET and HDPE comprise 98.8 percent of bottles recycled, with PP comprising 1.1 percent, according to the associations.

Data on PET recycling referenced in the report were separately funded and published by APR and the National Association for PET Container Resources (NAPCOR), Florence, Kentucky. A separate report, “Report on PET Container Recycling Activity in 2017,” is available on APR’s website.

157,"Trending: BASF, Coca-Cola, EC Break New Ground on Plastics Recycling","Continuing this year’s wave of near-constant innovations aimed at responsible management of post-consumer plastics are new advancements from both the private and public sector.

BASF announced it has broken new ground in plastic waste recycling with its ChemCycling project. Chemical recycling provides an innovative way to reutilize currently unrecyclable plastic waste, such as mixed or uncleaned plastics. Depending on the region, such waste is usually sent to landfill or burned with energy recovery.

But chemical recycling offers another alternative: Using thermochemical processes, these plastics can be utilized to produce syngas or oils. The resulting recycled raw materials are now partially replacing fossil resources as inputs in BASF’s production — making the company a pioneer in the manufacture of products based on chemically recycled plastic waste.

“A responsible use of plastics is crucial to solve the world’s waste problem. This applies to companies as well as to institutions and consumers. With chemical recycling we want to make a significant contribution in reducing the amount of plastic waste,” said Dr. Martin Brudermüller, Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors and Chief Technology Officer of BASF SE. “With our ChemCycling project, we are using plastic waste as a resource. In this way, we create value for the environment, society and the economy. We have joined forces with partners throughout the value chain to establish a working circular model.”

BASF is collaborating closely with its customers and partners, which range from waste management companies to technology providers and packaging producers, to build a circular value chain.

From waste to cheese packaging and fridge components

BASF is already developing pilot products, including mozzarella packaging, refrigerator components and insulation panels, with 10 customers from various industries. They are manufacturing products that meet high quality and hygiene standards — specifically required for food packaging, for example — as BASF’s ChemCycling products have the same properties as products made from fossil resources.

“This new way of recycling offers opportunities for innovative business models for us and our customers, who already place great value on products and packaging made from recycled materials but who cannot or do not want to make any compromises when it comes to quality,” says Stefan Gräter, head of the ChemCycling project.

As a next step, BASF plans to make the first products from the ChemCycling project commercially available.

BASF starts by feeding oil derived from plastic waste by an oiling process into the Production Verbund. BASF gets this feedstock for the pilot products from partner Recenso GmbH, Germany. As an alternative, syngas made from plastic waste can also be used. The first batch of this oil was fed into the steam cracker at BASF’s site in Ludwigshafen — the starting point for Verbund production, which breaks down or “cracks” this raw material at temperatures of around 850 degrees Celsius — in October. The primary outputs of the process are ethylene and propylene, which are used in the Verbund to make numerous chemical products. Under the mass balance approach, the share of recycled raw material can be mathematically allocated to the final certified product. Each customer can select the allocated percentage of recycled material.

Both the market and society expect industry to come up with constructive solutions to deal with plastic waste. Chemical recycling is an innovative complement to other recycling and waste management processes.

“We need a wide range of recovery options for plastic waste, since not every solution is suitable for each type of waste or possible for each product application,” explained Andreas Kicherer, sustainability expert at BASF. “The first choice should always be the solution that performs best in a life cycle assessment.”

While excited about its potential, BASF acknowledges that technological and regulatory conditions must be met before the project is market-ready — the existing technologies to recycle plastic waste into raw materials such as pyrolysis oil or syngas must be further developed and adapted so that consistently high quality is assured; and regional regulatory frameworks will considerably influence to what extent this approach can be established in each market.

Continuing to make headway of its own is the Coca-Cola Company, which has extended a loan to Ioniqa Technologies — a clean-tech spinoff from the Eindhoven University of Technology in The Netherlands, specialized in creating value out of waste by closing the loop on plastics — to facilitate the development of Ioniqa’s proprietary technology to produce high-grade, recycled PET content from hard-to-recycle PET waste. The agreement is designed to accelerate the development and deployment of high-grade recycled content PET for use by Coca-Cola in its bottles.

The investment supports the company’s ambition to work toward a World Without Waste, which includes a goal to create packaging made of at least 50 percent recycled material by 2030. The new technology supports a circular economy for plastics by allowing packages such as colored PET bottles, which may have been excluded from certain recycling streams, to be recycled into food-grade-quality packaging.

“Our investment in new and pioneering recycling technologies is an opportunity for significant movement toward closing the loop and creating a circular economy for PET,” said Robert Long, Coca-Cola’s Chief Innovation Officer. “We plan to continue investment in developing the right partnerships and initiatives to support our vision of a World Without Waste.”

The agreement aims to accelerate scale-up of Ioniqa’s recycling technology for PET. Ioniqa — which earlier this year partnered with Unilever and Indorama Ventures to apply its pioneering recycling technology to breaking down food packaging waste — is able to convert hard-to-recycle, PET-containing waste such as colored bottles into purified, polymer-building blocks that can later be re-formed into high-quality PET. The technology has been validated at the demonstration scale with value chain partners, and a 10-kMT industrial plant is under construction in The Netherlands for commissioning in 2019.

“Partnering with The Coca-Cola Company is a further validation of our journey to launch this unique process for transforming hard-to-recycle PET waste into high-quality, food-grade material,” said Tonnis Hooghoudt, CEO of Ioniqa. “The Ioniqa process allows for significant recovery and reuse of plastic materials that might otherwise not be recycled, while delivering quality, food-grade PET. The launch of our plant next year will be a step change in the transformation of hard-to-recycle PET plastic into a more widely usable recycled material, supporting the vision of Coca-Cola.”

Then, on the government front, last week — hot on the heels of the European Parliament’s backing of a sweeping ban on single-use plastics — the European Commission continued laying groundwork to implement a circular economy with the launch of the Circular Plastics Alliance, aimed at improving the economics and quality of plastics recycling in Europe. The Alliance will in particular strengthen the match between supply and demand for recycled plastics which is identified as the main obstacle to a well-functioning EU market of recycled plastics.

With this new initiative, the Commission wants to contribute to its objective of achieving at least 10 million tons of recycled plastics into new products on the EU market by 2025, as set in the European Strategy for Plastics.

""European industry has already clearly committed to more sustainable plastics with the pledges that they have submitted to the Commission. Business understands this is an opportunity to innovate and to become global frontrunners in new technology and materials, in line with circular economy logic,” said Vice-President Jyrki Katainen, responsible for Jobs, Growth, Investment and Competitiveness. “The platform will encourage cooperation and dialogue between market operators, both on the supply and the demand side, so that we can together build a well-functioning market for recycled plastics.""

The Circular Plastics Alliance will be a high-level, multi-stakeholder platform gathering key industry stakeholders covering the full plastics value chain — from waste collectors to recyclers and primary producers to converters, brand owners and retailers — with particular emphasis on the packaging, construction and automotive sectors.

The Alliance will pursue three main operational objectives:
• Fostering short-term, voluntary and coordinated actions and investments by key industry stakeholders. There actions and investments may cover separate collection of plastic waste; harmonised reporting on collection and recycling rates and volumes; investments in sorting and recycling facilities; voluntary standards on the 'design for recycling' of plastic products and others. Improving the economics and quality of plastics recycling in Europe would contribute to the achievement of the 10-million-tons target by 2025. Public authorities across Europe should also play an active role in that.
• Reporting on the obstacles, which may hamper stakeholders' efforts to fully deliver on their pledges and to reach the target set for 2025. Some of those already identified include lack of infrastructure, insufficient access to finance and standardisation gaps.
• Monitoring progress made towards more plastics recycling and more uptake of recycled plastics in Europe. The monitoring should help identify the gaps in the supply and demand for different recycled plastics. In parallel, new voluntary commitments will be encouraged.

First Vice-President Frans Timmermans, responsible for sustainable development, said: ""Close cooperation within and between all the links in the plastics value chain is essential if we are to achieve a true circular plastics economy and ensure that recycled plastics find their way to new products, instead of into landfills or the incinerators. The Circular Plastics Alliance aims to facilitate this cooperation, building on the commitments the plastics industry has already made and encouraging even more ambitious action. Europe already leads this, and Europe will be the first one to reap the benefits, as well. This is the best way to show the world that a circular plastic economy is good for the business and good for the environment.""

The Commission will invite key industry stakeholders to join the Alliance, in particular from the above-mentioned sectors, which account for most demand for plastics in Europe, with more sectors to be approached in order to address the full plastics value chain. The first meeting of the Circular Plastics Alliance will be organised as part of the EU Industry Days on 05 February 2019. A series of operational meetings on the key topics identified by the Alliance at its first meeting will take between March and May 2019.

160,Warning over deep-sea 'gold rush',"A ""gold rush"" of seabed mining could lead to unprecedented damage to fragile deep-sea ecosystems, researchers have warned.

With major decisions on the future of seabed mining expected in 2019-20, scientists and policy experts from the University of Exeter and Greenpeace have recommended a range of measures to prevent environmental damage.

They say deep-sea ecosystems currently need more protection, rather than new threats.

They also argue that mining in the deep sea (depths below 200m) could be avoided altogether if humanity moved towards a ""circular economy"" that focuses on reuse and recycling of metals, reduces overconsumption and limits built-in obsolescence of technology.

""This 'gold rush' is being driven by our ever-growing demand for minerals,"" said Dr. David Santillo, a marine biologist and senior Greenpeace scientist based at the University of Exeter.

""Should we allow seabed mining—with the risk it poses to deep-sea ecosystems—or should we focus instead on reducing this demand for virgin minerals?""

The scientists also call for an improved network of Marine Protected Areas, strict regulations and monitoring of all human activities on the seabed, and far greater transparency on the costs and benefits of any proposed mining.

""The deep sea is beyond the jurisdiction of any single state and we need more joined-up global governance to prevent biodiversity loss from human activities"", said Dr. Kirsten Thompson, a marine biologist at the University of Exeter and co-author on the study.

""Some areas targeted for seabed mining are known to be hotspots for biodiversity, including habitat for endemic corals and nursery grounds for sharks.""

The paper, published in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science, gives an overview of the current state of regulations and their likely effectiveness, with the aim to stimulate wider discussion before the International Seabed Authority reaches any decisions to allow commercial mining of the seafloor.

""Many marine scientists are concerned that, once the first commercial contract for mining is issued, there will be no going back,"" said Kathryn Miller, a co-author on the study.

""Before that happens, we should be absolutely certain that we have looked carefully at all the other options for a more sustainable future.""
• Sustainability: Create a ""circular economy"" based on reuse and recycling, extending product lifespans and discouraging overconsumption.
• Monitoring: Robust monitoring and research of deep-sea ecosystems through an international ocean agency.
• Transparency: Inform the global community, including all indigenous groups and small-island states, of the costs and benefits of proposed activity according to the United Nations convention stipulation that activities in the deep sea must be carried out for ""the benefit of mankind"".
• Legislation: Strict regulations to prevent harm to ecosystems must be enforced by the regulatory body and be independently verified.

167,Sustainable Affordable Housing,"A PROCESS TO MASS HOUSING DEVELOPMENT FOCUSING ON CLIMATE RESPONSE, RESOURCE EFFICIENCY AND ADAPTIVE COMFORT

India has estimated its urban housing shortage at 18.78 million units, which is projected to reach 48 million by 2022 according to a KPMG report. This shortage is especially looming for the urban poor, while the lower income group forms 96 per cent of this shortage. Mitigation to this shortage is put in place by the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Housing for All mission by 2022. About 200,000 hectares of land will be needed to provide the housing deficit until 2022, which translates to addition of 244 million tonnes of carbon emissions. Requirement for other resources and services such as water, energy, building materials, solid waste management, etc. will increase exponentially as well. For instance, the annual electricity use per household is projected to increase from 650 KWh in 2012 to 2750 kWh by 2050, according to a study.

It is imperative to ensure housing that is resource-efficient, climate-responsive, resilient, safe, healthy, comfortable and most importantly affordable to the rapidly growing urban masses, especially urban poor. Sustainable Development Goal No. 11 sets the target and provide indicators for cities to ensure adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services and upgradation of slums. CSE has extensive advocacy around sustainable development practices and is working with states to ensure mass housing stock does not underperform vis-a-vis the SDG targets.

169,Lafarge empowers over 600 people in Cross River,"Lafarge Africa Plc has empowered over 600 people in Cross River as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility.

 The empowerment which ranged from bursary awards to students in public secondary and tertiary institutions; to entrepreneurial development of over 400 youths in various ventures were geared toward improving life in its host community.

 Speaking at the 2018 Lafarge Community Day at Mfamosing in Cross River on Sunday, the Plant Manager of Lafarge, Mfamosing Plant, Peter Robson, said as an organisation, they always saw their host communities as partners.

 Robson said Lafarge was committed to sustainable development with special focus on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals which entrenched its 2030 sustainability agenda.

 He said: “Our sustainability goals focus on four pillars – climate change; circular economy; water and nature; and the people and community.

 “We are gathered today to make a formal presentation of our social responsibility project to the good people of Mfamosing.

 “They include the just-concluded Town Hall in Mfamosing and construction of Health Centre in Mbobui

 “Also the renovation of blocks of six classrooms in Ekong Anaku; Civic and Training Centre in Oban; and the distribution of reflective vests to students of primary and secondary schools.”

 Robson said that in 2018, the company extended its engagement with Non- Governmental Organisations such as CUSO International and Girls Power Initiative through which over 300 youths were currently being economically-empowered in different ventures.

 He assured the communities of Lafarge’s long-term commitment to investment in the communities and asked for their cooperation for these goals to be achieved.

 In his address, the Governor of Cross River, Prof. Ben Ayade, who was represented by his Special Adviser on Administration, Mark Obi, noted that Lafarge was a true example of a company that understood the meaning of Corporate Social Responsibility.

 According to Ayade, the government will do everything within its capacity to support Lafarge to continue its good works because what Lafarge is doing is in tandem with government’s policy of industrialisation.

 Similarly, the wife of the governor, Dr Linda Ayade, urged the company to continue its assorted give-back programmes which covered various sectors.

 Ayade, who was represented by the Commissioner for Health, Dr Inyang Asibong, recalled that it was the second time Lafarge was holding its Community Day in 2018.

 The governor’s wife announced that the construction of a sick bay for the Special Need School in Calabar by Lafarge had been completed.

 She encouraged members of the Mfamosing community to shun violence and take advantage of the educational and entrepreneurial opportunities offered by Lafarge.

 The Clan Head of Kasuk ll Qua Clan, His Highness Ededem Ayito, thanked the management of Lafarge for their developmental programmes in the rural communities.

 Ayito, who encouraged the company to continue its good works, explained that their projects were helping to reduce unemployment in the communities as many beneficiaries could start up businesses after being empowered.

174,It's time for cities to adopt circular economies,"We’ve all heard of the circular economy. Its potential is magnificent and it’s gaining ever more credence. But there’s one place where its opportunities have been less considered: cities. A new guide titled “Recycling Reimagined” tries to remedy that shortcoming.

Waste is one of the major issues cities face globally and until recently the best way to deal with it was recycling. Yet scientists and officials are starting to realize that waste is a complex matter. The major challenge is of course that most of waste still goes into dumps and incinerators.

Worse solutions are hard to imagine, but with the recent ban on international plastic waste imports by China, there is a clue where it’s heading: recycling doesn’t work either, or not as well as we thought it does.

An increasing number of global actors from states to corporations are out to explore novel ways of waste prevention, redesign, value retention, and circular business models. For example, in the US, increasing the waste diversion rate from 34% to 75% may create 1.1. million new jobs and prevent carbon emissions “equal to shutting down 72 coal power plants or removing 50 million cars from the road,” the guide says.

Now, it’s time for cities to join the race, it suggests. To move towards a circular economy, cities need to get smarter about measuring and analyzing their material flows, and not simply waste streams. This is something to which frontrunners like Amsterdam, Glasgow, London and a number of other pioneering cities have switched in recent years.

Another key front is stakeholders. Waste disposal is no longer an issue for a small community of haulers. Everyone who produces, transports, sells or consumes something is now part of it, or should be. Cases of cities like Austin and Phoenix, who are among zero waste pioneers in the US, show the power and importance of effective education, communication, and collaboration.

Only participatory approaches can give birth to liveable circular economy models, it is argued. Among other leverages cities need to act on are clear overall goals beyond just recycling rates, access to standard waste diversion options in public spaces (i.e. zero-waste shopping), fair and transparent standards for different actors, equal access for all housing sectors to composting, as well as overall strong focus on waste prevention (for example through sustainable purchasing).",United States,2018.12
175,SABIC invests in chemical recycling,"While other export markets have stepped in and U.S. consumers have increased their buying to keep aluminum scrap generated in the U.S. flowing, analysts from CRU Group question their ability to continue consuming the excess scrap that is available on the market.

Mike Southwood and Greg Wittbecker, both Pittsburgh-based aluminum industry analysts with CRU Group, spoke during a Dec. 12 webinar hosted by the Aluminum Recyclers Council (ARC), Wauconda, Illinois.

“When talking about the scrap supply glut in the U.S., obviously a lot of it has to do with China,” Southwood said, noting that the country had become the largest consumer of U.S.-generated twitch and zorba in the last decade. “The U.S. industry really built up around that to support it. Investments were made, shredders were added, and a lot of people and their companies relied on this trade of aluminum twitch and zorba over to China.”

However, he added that when China implemented its Green Fence initiative in 2013 to crack down on inferior quality imports, U.S. exports of aluminum scrap to that country declined 16 percent. As of late 2018, these exports have decreased 62 percent from their peak.



Southwood added that while shredded aluminum scrap imports to China increased in 2017, that growth was in response to China’s assertion that it would implement a scrap ban and uncertainty surrounding the scrap grades that would truly be affected. “There was a lot of uncertainty, and it created a lot of increased buying from China to get ahead of any potential scrap ban that might be coming down the pipeline,” he said.



In 2018, total aluminum scrap exports have increased despite declining imports from China, Southwood said. “At its height, China accounted for about 70 percent of total U.S. aluminum scrap exports in the years 2011 to 2013. [In 2018], annualized, we expect it will only account for about 34 percent of total aluminum scrap exports from the U.S.”

Southwood also attributed China’s reduced appetite for scrap in part to its increased self-sufficiency in this area.

According to CRU’s Beijing office’s analysis, China is prioritizing the support of secondary industries, as well, he said. “They estimate that secondary aluminum production will grow to about 15 million tons by 2025.”

China could still ban Category 6 material, which includes zorba, Southwood said, adding that the CMRA (China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association Recycling Metals Branch) wants to prevent this from happening. “Some colleagues of ours were at a conference over there, and the CMRA was discussing how they might avoid this, and they were looking at possibly changing the trade code—the HS code. They actually want to stop calling it scrap and refer to it as ‘recycled metal furnace feed,’” he added.

While these factors are affecting China’s aluminum scrap buying from the U.S., the biggest deterrent, Southwood said, was the 50 percent duty that China has placed on U.S. aluminum scrap imports in response to the Section 301 tariffs the U.S. placed on Chinese goods.

U.S. exporters have responded to the Chinese duties by shifting marketing efforts to other Asian markets. Southwood said U.S. exports of aluminum scrap to India and Malaysia, in particular, have increased by 176,000 tons in 2018. He said this has nearly covered the 204,000-ton gap created by the decline in trade with China.

“Obviously, if you are a domestic U.S. scrap generator, you are encouraged by the pace of exports that we have seen to these alternative markets,” Wittbecker said. However, he added, “The pace of increased exports to places like India, South Korea and Turkey is not sustainable based on the rates of growth in the CRU forecast that second alloy demand is going to grow in these markets.”



Wittbecker continued, “So, while in the short run it is encouraging to see export volumes of scrap going up to these other markets, which would cause you to draw the conclusion that the market has been able to replace China … our response to that would be that there has been a short-term response. Scrap prices got very cheap, people in those markets reacted to a bargain, and they are importing a lot more scrap. But the difficulty is that they can't consume scrap at that run rate for an extended period of time. The punchline here is that it's unrealistic to expect exports to these markets to continue at the same pace that we've seen so far this year because they simply don't have the demand in those markets to absorb that scrap.”

Within the U.S., Southwood said for much of 2018 the market could not absorb the overhang of aluminum scrap in the market. “From what we understand, that is still the case and they are actually booking into late Q1 2019, early Q3” for scrap. He added that this excess has contributed to softer prices and historically wider spreads.

“When you get into the automotive segment, that’s where you see some constraints in people being able to absorb this tremendous increase in automotive-related scrap,” Wittbecker said. “The difficulty that is involved with the automotive alloys is that some of these alloys are more or less scrap friendly, so to speak. In other words, different mills have higher or lower capabilities of absorbing these scraps when they come back from different OEMs (original equipment manufacturers).”

Wittbecker added that the varying chemistries of automotive aluminum scrap are challenging some mills’ abilities to effectively use this material.



Within the U.S., a number of aluminum scrap consumers are investing in added scrap processing capacity, he said, including Tri-Arrows Aluminum Inc., Spectro Alloys Corp., Matalco, Arconic, JW Aluminum, Alcoa and Braidy Industries.

“I think the key message here is that most of the investment that you are seeing right now in this market is from the mills that are looking to try to take advantage of this increase in automotive supply and not really all that much increase in capacity to take advantage of the increased zorba and twitch,” Wittbecker said, noting that the Spectro investment was the only one that targets this material.



“I think if you talk to people in the industry, they would say that we probably have enough installed capacity to use more scrap,” he continued. “The real question on the obsolete grades is do we have sufficient growth in secondary demand to really allow us to absorb additional scrap. It's the same issue that I mentioned about some of these external markets like India and Korea—a lot of supply available, but can they use it and turn it into alloys that they in turn can sell themselves.”



Wittbecker added, “In the long run, the people that are really going to do well in this type of environment are the people that invest in the ability to use more scrap and the extent to which they can wean themselves off of additional primary metal units.”",United States,2018.12
176,"Coca-Cola Supports A Plastic-Free Planet, With A New Investment In Ioniqa Technologies","Earlier this fall we heard that Coca-Cola, along with some of the world's largest organizations, signed the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, a commitment to begin eliminating unnecessary plastic packaging and, by 2025, moving entirely to plastic that is reusable, compostable, recyclable, and created using renewable energy.

And according to a recent announcement, it seems as though they are following through on their word. Coca-Cola has invested in Ioniqa Technologies, a recycling company based in the Netherlands. The loan supports the development of Ionqia's new technology, which will eventually make it so hard-to-recycle PET (like colored plastic bottles often rejected from recycling facilities) can be processed into high-quality PET packaging. The lending hand will accelerate the development of the technology so that sooner rather than later Coca-Cola can use the high-grade recycled content for their bottles.

The financial venture also supports Coca-Cola's A World Without Waste mission, which includes a plan to move to 50 percent recycled packaging by 2030.

""Our investment in new and pioneering recycling technologies is an opportunity for significant movement toward closing the loop and creating a circular economy for PET,"" said Robert Long, chief innovation officer for the Coca-Cola Company.

So far the recycling technology has proved successful in preliminary demonstrations, and a plant is under construction in the Netherlands for use in 2019, though there are some questions around how recycling plants will deal with this new material.

With 1.9 billion bottles of Coca-Cola products consumed each day in more than 200 countries, this investment has the potential for major impact.",United States,2018.12

184,London Works to Keep Plastic Beverage Kegs from Landfill,"Most plastic beverage kegs in the U.K. are not recycled and often end up in landfill. To overcome this problem, First Mile has teamed up with KeyKeg and OneCircle to create a circular program that recycles plastic kegs, turning them into new, usable plastic kegs.

The program has been launched as a pilot in London, where First Mile collects the used KeyKegs from bars and delivers them to plastic recycling specialists OneCircle, where they are then processed and turned back into KeyKegs—a circular economy product.

More than 90 percent of the plastic kegs in the U.K. are KeyKegs, so once rolled out, this initiative will dramatically reduce the number of plastic kegs being thrown into general waste and potentially ending up in landfill.

Lightweight Containers, the company behind KeyKeg, actively works as a packaging producer with KeyKegs in the waste phase. Together with its customers, beverage distributors and bars, the company is building a community that is collecting KeyKegs and preparing them for processing. OneCircle, an initiative of the company Lightweight Containers, is responsible for the recycling and transportation of KeyKegs.

First Mile, a carbon-neutral waste processor working for more than 25,000 companies in London, sees new opportunities with the collection of KeyKegs.

""We estimate that more than 500,000 KeyKegs end up in London every year, and it is great that we can now use them as raw materials again,” said Joe Allen, chief commercial officer of First Mile, in a statement. “It meets a huge need. Many bars have heard that we are going to process KeyKegs and have spontaneously saved them up. It is clear to them that a lot of plastic ends up in landfill, and they want to prevent that from happening. The time has come to work together with packaging producers on closed loops, and KeyKeg is leading the way.""

In England, OneCircle is building a nationwide collection network. Members of the network collect and crush the KeyKegs into bales. OneCircle collects the bales and transports around 12,000 KeyKegs per truckload to the processing plant.

""We're aiming to reuse the raw materials worldwide. Ideally, this would be to make the next KeyKegs, but we want to minimize our ecological footprint, so it may be more sustainable in some situations to make them into other high-quality recycled products,” said Annemieke Hartman from OneCircle in a statement. “We can recycle our kegs now because years ago, we designed the KeyKeg & UniKeg with circularity in mind. We have developed various collection models and recycling methods and are supporting circular solutions around the globe. We work together with brewers, beverage distributors and innovative waste companies such as First Mile and GroenCollect. We have developed tools that allow our supply chain to separate the valuable materials and are actively looking for people and companies to join our fast-growing community.”

The plastic recycling industry in Europe is struggling with the rapidly growing, complex streams of plastic. There are more than 250 types of plastic and only a few can be reused. The vast majority of them are used in one-off, low-value applications, or either landfilled or incinerated. A KeyKeg consists of 81 percent PP and PET, two types of plastics that can be reused as a circular raw material. The rest of the materials can be used in other high-quality applications. Each KeyKeg already consists of 30 percent recycled material. This share will increase further in 2019 to 40 percent, the companies noted.",United States,2018.12

188,Coca-Cola invests in PET recycling company,"
• None develop the tools to process otherwise hard-to-recycle PET plastics, according to a company release. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.
• None The loan comes as Coca-Cola pursues plans to transition to at least 50% recycled packaging materials by 2030. Most forms of PET are easy to recycle, but the technology targets the outliers that may have been excluded from recycling streams, such as colored plastic bottles.
• ""Our investment in new and pioneering recycling technologies is an opportunity for significant movement toward closing the loop and creating a circular economy for PET,"" Robert Long, chief innovation officer for Coca-Cola, said in the release.

Consumers are driving the demand for recycled plastic bottles. Eager for more environmentally friendly products, many shoppers want to see companies transition their packaging to recycled alternatives. Coca-Cola’s loan to the plastics recycling start-up suggests the beverage company wants to boost its image as a sustainable brand — and it thinks consumers will appreciate that effort.

But the dynamics of recycled plastics are anything but simple. Recycled PET faces competition on a global scale. Studies show that it can be cheaper and easier to produce new PET rather than manage a complex waste stream and processing plastic bottles. If the start-up company can provide a viable and successful route forward, this loan could be well worth it.

PET is one of the most commonly used plastic resins in food and beverage packaging, but recycled PET accounts for just 12-14% of the plastic packaging produced. The material recycles well, but it isn't easy to achieve food-grade plastic from recycled goods. Most often, plastic bottles wind up in carpets or clothes. Each pass through the recycling process degrades the quality.

Ioniqa says it solves this problem by producing a food-grade PET from post-consumer recycled waste. It isn't alone. Montreal-based Loop Industries partnered with Evian earlier this year to develop 100% recycled bottles. Loop is also working with Coca-Cola to integrate recycled plastics into European bottling plants. More beverage companies are getting involved in recycling efforts to get ahead of competition and show consumers they prioritize sustainability efforts.

But new technology aside, plastic recycling rates have been in decline for several years. Not only do recyclers have less to work with, but the flexibility that has led to the widespread use of PET in packaging also makes it harder to recycle. There is very little consistency in weight, density, size and color of plastics. Recyclers sort through the arriving waste before processing, which costs time and money.

The new technology from Ioniqa deals specifically with types of plastic that are hard to recycle. Recycling facilities tend to prefer clear plastics, which command a higher price. Ioniqa appears to be stepping into territory existing plastics processors have avoided. Coca-Cola isn't its only likely client in the major CPG world. Unilever also announced a partnership with the same start up earlier this year.

Many recyclers find themselves undercut because it's cheaper and easier for manufacturers to purchase new PET. The inefficiency of recycled PET gets back to consumers at the end of the day: if a bottle gets trashed rather than recycled, that limits the supply that recyclers have to work with and can hurt companies' reputations.

Coca-Cola and Ioniqa Technologies have yet to publicly discuss how they anticipate managing these issues. But they say that the new recycling technology will make it easier to recycle plastics. Still, Ioniqa will likely grapple with many of the same questions and challenges other companies have faced when accessing the raw material and competing with cheaper, non-recycled alternatives.",United States,2018.12
189,The Coca-Cola Company Invests in Enhanced Recycling Technologies,"Coca-Cola says that the company has made two investments aimed at speeding up the development and deployment of enhanced recycling technologies to convert recycled plastic into food-grade PET for use in their beverage bottles.

The beverage corporation is extending a loan to Ioniqa Technologies, which is building its first PET plastic upcycling factory in the Netherlands. They also established an agreement with Loop Industries for authorized bottlers to purchase 100% recycled Loop PET. Financial details about both deals were not made public.

“Our aspiration — as part of our World Without Waste vision — is to close the loop on our packaging by helping turn more old bottles into new ones,” said Scott Pearson, senior director of Global R&D Engineering for the Coca-Cola Company.

Earlier this year, Coca-Cola launched World Without Waste, an ambitious plan to collect and recycle the equivalent of every bottle or can the company sells globally by 2030. Over the summer, Coca-Cola installed reverse vending machines at four attraction sites in Great Britain and at the 2018 Special Olympics USA Games in Seattle.

The latest investments are for enhanced recycling. Coca-Cola explained that, unlike mechanical recycling, enhanced recycling allows recovery and reuse of PET plastic without material degradation. Depolymerization converts PET into its original building blocks, which are easier to purify. These blocks can then be repolymerized into plastic resin to create high-quality PET material, the company points out.

“Enhanced recycling is one technology needed to drive a circular economy,” Pearson said. “It’s a big next step… but it’s not the only step. We still want to minimize use of virgin plastics and continue to lightweight our packaging and use as little material as possible.”

190,Why we need to reimagine plastic recycling in the UK,"When thinking about recycling we tend to think of state of the art, new technology. A process that is innovative, clean and most importantly green.

Having worked in sustainability with a focus on recycling for 10 years, this green image is not reflected in my encounters with the industry in the UK. The culture I am confronted with is that of a scrap metal merchant; a ‘wheeler-dealer’ mentality that views innovation and technology with trepidation. Not an industry which supports and welcomes research into new and inspiring technologies.

There are 7 types of plastics that are recycled in the UK and many companies who run plastic recycling plants in the UK simply do not understand the technology needed to recycle PET Plastic. Only through understanding this technology and being transparent in the process can this be achieved.

Unfortunately we are seeing a total lack of transparency in the plastics recycling industry in the UK. Along with high costs to innovate and a sheer laziness to invest, the industry needs to be totally reimagined.

In recent months we have seen reports of Britain’s plastics recycling industry being accused of leaking pollution into oceans and massively exaggerating waste figures. The industry is facing an investigation by the Environment Agency over widespread fraud.

Transparent, it is not.

If we focus on how Local Authorities recycle we can clearly see that they are failing the public. Swindon council announced earlier this year that it is planning to tell residents to stop recycling mixed plastic. If other councils follow suit we will see decades of recycling simply go to waste.

It is true that councils have very poor recycling rates. There is clearly a lack of money for the technology that is needed to be truly sustainable and councils are not addressing the poor skill set in the industry. They simply do not have the technical skill set in-house to deliver solutions to our recycling problems- so it must up to the industry to reimagine how the UK recycles. The industry must evolve and develop better techniques that are also economically beneficial and competitive.

A key reason for our poor recycling rates in the UK is that the industry simply does not appreciate manufacturers’ sustainability mandates and what drives them. Do recyclers truly understand the circular economy and the sustainability agenda of the corporate world? To me it is clear that recyclers in the UK are failing to understand the corporate sustainability supply chain, meaning they are not producing recycled materials that are of high enough quality for corporations to buy and use.

Manufacturers are committed to reusing recycled material. With public scrutiny of big business and their commitment to sustainability, major manufacturers are wholly open about optimising recycling. This is not a manufacturer problem.

If Local Authorities and recyclers understood and appreciated the demands of manufactures and their sustainability mandates, then they could work with them to produce recycled plastic that can be used again – ridding ourselves of single-use plastic.

The recycling industry in the UK seems to have a ‘if it’s not broken don’t fix it’ mentality. It’s easier to stick with the status quo rather than the bureaucracy of innovation. However it is clear to me and to many others that our recycling industry in the UK is indeed broken. And the British public have woken up to this.

Single use plastics are sometimes thrown upon the public without their consent and usually from sheer impracticality such as coffee cups. But the public have woken up to this. Collins Dictionary naming “single-use” as the word of 2018 reflects the increasing global awareness in environmental issues.

Recycling PET helps ensure that a piece of plastic has more than a one-time use, albeit its second life might in the guise of a different product. Re-use is king. Let’s stop relying on oil when we have vast reserves of plastic desperately in need of being recycled.

PET is one of the most common materials we use in our daily lives. It is it is the most prevalent of the 7 types of plastic. By focusing on this material we can help ensure it is 100% recycled. PET handles our food and drink, our primary needs to survive. Raising awareness centred around our basic needs will ultimately contribute to change in consumer behaviour and perhaps in the near future, an era where the recycling process in the UK is transparent. Where the process is innovative, green and clean. With single-use plastics assigned to history.",United States,2018.12

193,HPE Financial Services Announces Capabilities to Guide Customers Toward Circular Economy,"PALO ALTO, Calif., Dec. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, HPE Financial Services (NYSE:HPE) announced a new Circular Economy Report that provides IT and sustainability organizations with a tool to estimate and share the carbon, energy and landfill waste savings achieved by returning retired or end-of-use assets to HPE, for processing through HPE Technology Renewal Centers.



Based on deep material science and product manufacturing information, the Circular Economy Report shows a breakdown by category of the products that were refurbished, remarketed and reintroduced into the economy, as well and those materials that were put back into the economy as recycled materials. The report can be used by organizations when disclosing their indirect (Scope 3) greenhouse gas emissions to investor and customer-driven disclosures such as the CDP.1

Additionally, HPE announced it has joined the Ellen McArthur Foundation’s CE 100 group – a pre-competitive innovation program established to enable organizations to develop new opportunities and realize their Circular Economy ambitions faster. It brings together enterprises, governments and cities, academic institutions, emerging innovators and affiliates in a unique multi-stakeholder platform.

“A Circular Economy commitment helps IT meet business and sustainability goals, while reducing the world’s growing e-waste problem,” said Irv Rothman, President and CEO of HPE Financial Services. “Our aspiration is to help customers think about their infrastructure in new ways, build strategies to extend and extract value from what they have, and use retired assets to help fund the transition to new infrastructure.”

As companies leverage the power of connectivity and data to generate business value, they are investing in expanding their IT infrastructure to store and process exponentially more information. There is an opportunity and imperative to invest in technology that will allow businesses to operate and thrive in a resource-constrained world and find new ways to manage the explosive demand for data by using far less space, materials, and energy; this is the Circular Economy.

A Circular Economy reimagines a take-make-dispose system to a circular and regenerative economy. It considers the full product lifecycle: from resource extraction, to product design and use – all the way to end-of-use management to extend product and material life and lower total cost of ownership. From a customer perspective, key drivers for a Circular Economy approach are new sources of business value and infrastructure efficiency. From a sustainability perspective, the need to move to a Circular Economy is driven by a consumption rate that is beyond the earth's ability to replenish.

Applying Circular Economy principles to the IT industry drives a more effective use of products and materials and enables businesses to retire their IT assets in a secure, compliant, and environmentally responsible manner. A recent HPE Financial Services study2 showed that sustainability is critical, with 79 percent of companies committing to an environmental sustainability strategy, and 69 percent specifically having an IT sustainability strategy in place. In addition, 48 percent of the companies surveyed are highly regulated and must report on environmental impacts.

HPE’s new Circular Economy Report gives customers key information to estimate IT’s contribution to their Sustainability and Environmental Reporting (SER) requirements; it provides an analysis of the re-use to recycling ratio, as well as estimates of savings in energy, materials, greenhouse gas emissions and landfill volume avoided, so customers can track progress toward goals. At the same time, the report shows how through refurbishing and recycling their retired IT products, customers can return value to their business while helping to meet their sustainability goals.

The report is part of the IT Asset Lifecycle Solutions delivered by HPE Financial Services that include:
• Asset Upcycling Services – By providing true market value for resold equipment, Asset Upcycling Services can maximize the value of end-of-use assets, providing money back that customers can reinvest in other innovation projects. Asset Upcycling Services also help protect stored data by providing data overwriting and environmentally responsible removal and recycling.
• Certified Pre-owned Products – Companies can extend the life of legacy systems with tested, certified, used IT equipment, including the entire current HPE portfolio, from 18 months up to 25 years old. These products are available to purchase, lease, or rent.
• Virtual Warehouse Services – Customers can save costs and extend legacy system life by supporting their future needs with their existing assets; they can store, update, or redeploy decommissioned equipment from HPE’s centralized warehousing facilities.
• Datacenter Consolidation Services – By renting HPE’s pre-configured, customized systems, customers can ensure an interruption-free transition during their data center relocation or consolidation.
• Proof of Concept Enablement Services – HPE’s pool of IT technology can be deployed and redeployed to demo a design concept to OEMs and application vendors, or for extended usage in a real business production environment.

HPE’s global expertise and understanding of the requirements and options for safe recycling helps customers do the right thing, while maximizing their IT investments by putting equipment with value back into the world as a working asset for other customers. HPE’s Technology Renewal Centers (TRCs) in Andover, Massachusetts and Erskine, Scotland help extend the life of technology whenever possible, and securely and responsibly recycle materials where appropriate. In 2018, HPE Technology Renewal Centers processed over 4 million units, including HPE and non-HPE equipment. Of that, 89% was refurbished and resold, and the rest was recycled in a secure and environmentally responsible way.

The new Circular Economy Report is available to HPE Lease Return customers and Asset Upcycling Services customers. More information on HPE Financial Services capabilities to advance Circular Economy is available at .

That’s why we decided this year to dedicate one full day to sustainability because we think that today sustainability is as important as fashion.”

Here’s a snapshot of the conversations swirling around circularity at Denim Première Vision.

When it comes to sustainability, recycling is the last option for the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

Founded in 2010, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation works with brand partners and governments to accelerate the transition to a circular economy by sharing news and case studies, circular workshops and launching systemic initiatives, including Make Fashion Circular.

The initiative, launched last year at the Copenhagen Fashion Summit, works to create a new textile economy and includes partners like H&M, Nike and Stella McCartney.

Echoing Denim Première Vison’s focus on responsible design, Francois Souchet, project manager for Ellen MacArthur, urged the denim supply chain to design its own waste. “We need to start thinking about the lifecycle of the products we create,” he said.

The foundation is based on three principles: to design out waste and pollution, keep products in use, and to regenerate natural systems to ensure they come back year after year. Before recycling is ever up for consideration, Souchet said, the foundation encourages brands, retailers and consumers to find ways to reuse, refurbish or share a garment.

“Companies are working in all different directions,” Souchet said. “We try to come together and think about what can be accomplished on a bigger level.”

When Mud Jeans launched in 2012 as a post-consumer recycled denim brand that also offers a leasing program, the brand caught the attention of savvy consumers seeking new ways to save a buck—and the planet.

Jeans retail for 119 euros ($135), or consumers can pay a small monthly fee (7.50 euros after a one-time membership fee) to rent a jean for 12 months. Consumers can trade in leased jeans for a new pair, which helps guarantee that the jeans will be repaired, recycled or upcycled by the company.

Today, six years later, a quarter of Mud Jeans are leased. The percentage of consumers leasing hasn’t increased, but the total volume has, said Mud Jeans co-owner Dion Vijgeboom.

Leasing jeans is just one part of the brand’s efforts to create a circular economy. The company, which recently received the Nordic Swan Ecolabel certification for 41 of its styles, is investing in R&D to increase the amount of post-consumer recycled denim used its production, which currently stands around 40 percent.

However, the cost of being a sustainable brand remains a hurdle for Mud Jeans.

Vijgeboom says scaling hinges on how widely post-consumer denim is adopted by the industry and the frequency of which consumers recycle their jeans. Processing recycled cotton is still substantially more than virgin cotton, but Vijgeboom said the company expects to “optimize” its production once it reaches a quantity of 500,000 jeans a year.

And the brand is testing its own limits, by investing in R&D that will help increase each pair’s eco footprint.

“We would like to go higher, but we are currently recycling through mechanical recycling,” Eva Engelen, head of CSR for Mud Jeans said, which shortens fibers. In order to keep strength and performance, the fibers need to be blended with virgin cotton.

“But we should go higher than 40 percent and we are investigating other innovations to do this,” she said.

The quick adoption of Lenzing’s Refibra technology in denim helps quell doubts about the viability of circular materials in commercial products.

Since launching Refibra in 2017, the reclaimed cellulose, which is converted from post-industrial cotton waste, has been implemented into 12 retail programs with brands like Levi’s, DL1961, Kings of Indigo and Reformation.

“This is really showing proof that we can produce this product and it can be reached by consumers,” Carey said. “It’s about how we can inform consumers and bring the message and understanding of this value.”

And the company is ramping up the amount of waste it’s recycling—a request Carey says is coming from the market. In 2019, Lenzing will begin to offer Refibra made with 10 percent more post-industrial cotton, increasing the amount of waste recycled from 20 percent to 30 percent.

“Brands are asking how can we bring in more circularity in our products,” she said, adding that many brands and retailers are vying to set circular standards and goals. “There’s a will for circularity.”",United States,2018.12

197,Ban plastic straws and bags? Then what?,"There's a veritable war on plastics, with over 60 countries and 350 municipalities across the U.S introducing actions on single-use plastics. Because improperly managed plastic waste damages our physical ecosystem and economy, it's understandable why bans are becoming so popular.

But the motivation behind them remains unclear. What is the problem with plastics that we're trying to solve? Is it climate change? Reducing litter in our oceans? The lack of recycling technology and infrastructure? The push toward a circular economy — keeping resources in use for as long as possible?

If left undefined, plastic bans are merely a superficial win to an amorphous end state. Precipitously banning plastic straws and bags without rationale and a well-defined strategic plan for further action is only a symbolic and sanguine attempt that erroneously leads the public to believe that a prohibition is the ultimate and only solution to the world's myriad problems with plastic.

So what problem with plastics are we trying to solve?

If our global goal is to combat climate change, then we should consider polices that reduce emissions and resource expenditures. Contrary to conventional wisdom about plastics, life cycle assessments demonstrate that replacing plastic resins with ostensibly ecofriendly or biodegradable alternatives (cotton, paper-based material, cork, wood, fibers, etc.) is far more energy- and resource-intensive by a wide margin when it comes to land and water use, energy demand and expenditure, carbon emissions and global warming and ozone depletion potential. Encouraging understudied alternatives that release carbon and methane during decomposition and have greater environmental impacts across the entire life cycle contradicts this goal.

The latest Politico poll indicates that 68 percent of voters are concerned about the effects of climate change, while nearly half of all World Economic Forum survey participants chose climate change as their top issue. Among them, nearly 80 percent reported they would modify their lifestyle to protect the environment.

If that's the case, maybe we should think about the climate benefits of plastic. Perhaps the extremely slow decomposition of plastic that sequesters carbon and impedes the release of methane for centuries is not such a bad thing if we want to positively impact climate change.

If the goal is to reduce marine litter, bans will only slightly reduce the 8.8 million metric tons of plastic waste that enter the oceans annually, of which 0.09 percent originates from North America — and plastic straws account for only 0.03 percent of this total. A recent report found that cigarette butts are the most common flotsam collected. Plastic grocery bags were ranked number five and plastic straws number seven, while half of all the debris in the oceans was lost or abandoned fishing gear. Separate studies on entanglement, ingestion and chemical contamination show fishing gear has the most severe effects on marine ecosystems — plastic straws carry less risk than other debris such as plastic bags.

Rather than focus on single-use plastics alone, perhaps government action should be redirected to the highest-risk regions, such as East Asia, items that are most frequently found in marine systems or debris that has the greatest environmental impact.

And what if our goal is improving recycling infrastructure?

In that case, our focus should be on investing in and scaling up technology and infrastructure to recycle all plastic chemistries, including low-grade, low-density and mixed plastics. The reality is that only 9 percent of the global plastic waste produced in 2015 was recycled due to a lack of viable outlets, deficient technologies and consumer oversight of recycling guidelines.

Alternatively, if a circular economy is the preferred goal, then policies should be instituted that support a sustainable model for plastic manufacturing and usage that is supplemented with plastics-to-fuel technology so that we harness the stored hydrocarbon energy in plastics and use it as a continual feedstock for fuels.

Assuming recycling and a circular economy are the stated goals, banning plastics disincentivizes and stifles innovation to create better technologies and infrastructure so that we not only reduce, reuse and recycle, but recover, redesign and remanufacture.

Simply introducing single-use plastic bans without first defining the problem and contemplating a practical, holistic plan is premature and will result in rudimentary, dead-ended and misguided policies. Instead, we need to establish strategies that create economic, social and environmental sustainability that will ultimately keep plastics out of the ocean and enable us to use these valuable materials to improve our global standard of living while reducing our environmental footprint. Fixating on one-off solutions without further action will prevent us from getting there.

198,The RealReal and Stella McCartney Strengthen Partnership,"SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The RealReal and Stella McCartney announced today the extension through 2019 of their partnership to drive consumers to participate in a circular economy through consignment. The partnership keeps Stella McCartney items out of landfills by giving them a second life through resale. Stella shoppers who consign with The RealReal receive an immediate $100 store credit to shop at Stella retail stores or online. The partnership has yielded strong results year over year, with The RealReal consignors of Stella McCartney items increasing by 65 percent and the number of Stella McCartney items consigned increasing by 74 percent.

By motivating Stella shoppers to consign with The RealReal, this partnership is a step forward in shifting the traditionally negative environmental impact of fashion. The fashion industry is one of the top polluting industries in the world. And, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation report ""The New Textiles Economy,"" the equivalent of one garbage truck of textiles is landfilled or burned every second.

""Moving from reducing our negative environmental impact to making a positive impact requires all of us to change our mindset and leverage solutions that will make fashion circular and eliminate waste. The partnership with The RealReal created an easy and impactful solution for our customers to participate in a circular economy. We look forward to growing the partnership in 2019,"" stated Stella McCartney, founder and creative director.

""The success of this innovative partnership between The RealReal and Stella McCartney shows the exciting opportunities to create a thriving fashion industry, where the clothes we love never become waste,"" commented Francois Souchet, Lead, Make Fashion Circular, Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

Stella McCartney is a pioneer of countless sustainable fashion innovations since starting her namesake brand 17 years ago. The recognition by the designer of consignment as a critical piece of the circular economy has brought attention to its importance across the industry. By buying Stella McCartney and consigining with The RealReal, consumers are helping the planet by keeping well-made, sustainably manufactured items out of landfills. Through its consignment of authenticated, luxury women's fashion alone, The RealReal has offset the energy and greenhouse gases equivalent to 65 million car miles.

ABOUT THE ELLEN MACARTHUR FOUNDATION 

The Ellen MacArthur Foundation was launched in 2010 to accelerate the transition to a circular economy. The Foundation works across five key areas: insight and analysis, business and government, learning, systemic initiatives and communications.

With its Knowledge Partners (Arup, IDEO, McKinsey & Company and SYSTEMIQ), the Foundation works to quantify the economic opportunity of a more circular model and to develop approaches for capturing its value.

The Foundation collaborates with its Global Partners (Danone, Google, H&M, Intesa Sanpaolo, NIKE Inc., Philips, Renault, Solvay, Unilever), Core Philanthropic Funders (SUN, MAVA, players of People's Postcode Lottery (GB)) and its CE100 network (businesses, universities, emerging innovators, governments, cities, affiliate organisations), to build capacity, explore collaboration opportunities and to develop circular business initiatives.

The Foundation creates global teaching and learning platforms on the circular economy, encompassing work with leading businesses, universities, schools and colleges, and online events such as the Disruptive Innovation Festival. By establishing initiatives such as the New Plastics Economy, the Foundation works to transform key material flows, applying a global, cross-sectoral, chain approach that aims to effect systems change.

The Foundation promotes the idea of a circular economy via research reports, case studies, and book series using multiple channels, web and social media platforms, including , a leading source of circular economy insight. Further information: | @circulareconomy",United States,2018.12
199,The RealReal Partnership with Stella McCartney Extended,"The RealReal and Stella McCartney have decided to celebrate their year-long partnership by extending the collaboration to promote a circular economy. Through collaborating together, the San Francisco-based luxury-consignment company and the high-end designer are minimizing waste by extending the life of McCartney's designs through resale—rather than sending used products to landfills.

“Moving from reducing our negative environmental impact to making a positive impact, requires all of us to change our mindset and leverage solutions that will make fashion circular and eliminate waste,"" the designer said in a press release. ""The partnership with The RealReal created an easy and impactful solution for our customers to participate in a circular economy. We look forward to growing the partnership in 2019.”

Reports from The RealReal show consignors of Stella McCartney items increasing by 65 percent year over year. Consignment of Stella McCartney goods has increased 74 percent year over year.

The collaboration also saw the launch of The RealReal's Sustainabilty Calculator in October. This project was an effort between the consignment company and advisors from The Ellen MacArthur Foundation—an organization that promotes a circular economy—and Stella McCartney. By showing The RealReal consignors how their consignment benefits the environment, the company hopes to promote greater awareness regarding the connection between resale and sustainability.



""The success of this innovative partnership between The RealReal and Stella McCartney shows the exciting opportunities to create a thriving fashion industry, where the clothes we love never become waste,” Francois Souchet, who leads the Make Fashion Circular initiative at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, said in a statement.

In addition to launching its Sustainability Calculator, consignment made through The RealReal have conserved enough energy and combated the effects of greenhouse gasses in the equivalent of 65 million driving miles.",United States,2018.12
200,How Stella McCartney is encouraging people not to buy new clothes,"With a renewed partnership between the fashion label and resale consigner The RealReal, McCartney is coaxing consumers into a circular economy.

Like most retail industries that rely on consumers to keep buying more-more-more, much of the fashion world is the same. New seasons, new trends, new “it” colors – we are presented with all the latest must-haves, while last year’s clothes linger in the closet and even worse, find their way to the enduring abyss that is the landfill.

Case in point: Closets in the United Kingdom play home to an estimated $46.7 billion worth of unworn clothes. Meanwhile, the average American throws out 81 pounds of clothing every year; leading to some 26 billion pounds of textiles and clothes in landfills.

Given that the clothing and textile industry is one of the largest polluters in the world, second only to oil, it’s obvious that the current model has to change.

Maybe one of the most efficacious changes would be to eliminate fast fashion. But in the meantime, here’s another idea: Embrace a circular economy by buying second-hand clothes – which is where Stella McCartney and resale consigner The RealReal come into the picture.

McCartney and The RealReal have had a partnership to drive consumers to participate in a circular economy through consignment – a partnership that has proven so successful that they have just announced they will be extending it through 2019. For those unfamiliar with The RealReal, it’s the beloved-by-many online consignment site (with brick and mortar stores in New York and Los Angeles) where customers can sell and buy previously owned high-end apparel. The offerings are vast, everything is authenticated, and the process of both selling and buying really could not be easier.

The partnership provides incentives to help keep Stella McCartney items out of landfills by giving them a second life through resale. The partnership has yielded great results year over year, with The RealReal consignors of Stella McCartney items increasing by 65 percent and the number of Stella McCartney items consigned increasing by 74 percent.

“Moving from reducing our negative environmental impact to making a positive impact requires all of us to change our mindset and leverage solutions that will make fashion circular and eliminate waste. The partnership with The RealReal created an easy and impactful solution for our customers to participate in a circular economy. We look forward to growing the partnership in 2019,” says McCartney.

In promoting resale, McCartney defies the conventional corporate model of enticing buyers to buy new things – how novel is that?! But it comes as little surprise from this brand. Since starting her label 17 years ago, McCartney has been the wonder-kid of sustainable fashion innovations. She has never used leather or fur in her designs. And beyond a commitment to ethical values, the company is unusually careful with resource use and environmental impact, from design to store practices and product manufacturing.

Another thing I love about this partnership, and The RealReal in general, is that they are redefining what it means to wear second-hand clothes. While thrifty, resourceful, and creative types all know the beauty of a thrift shop or flea market, now there’s a whole new generation of fashionistas shopping consignment, people who previously would have never worn something previously owned. The SoHo store is like being at very comfortable Barney’s, there’s a café and I’ve even seen women shopping with champagne in hand. I mean, thank heavens we’ll always have our good old musty thrift shops, but businesses like The RealReal open up the market to a new kind of shopper. That the prices are so much lower than retail also puts well-made and long-wearing luxury items within reach of consumers who may not be able to afford them otherwise.

Through its consignment of women’s fashion alone (they also deal in men’s fashion and home goods), The RealReal has offset the energy and greenhouse gases equivalent to 65 million car miles. What’s not to love? Throw in a discounted Stella blouse otherwise destined for the landfill and it feels like this should be the future of shopping.

201,Stella McCartney Extends Fashion Consignment Partnership Into 2019,"Stella McCartney’s fashion and lifestyle brand has extended its partnership with luxury consignment company The RealReal through 2019 to keep products out of landfills. Shoppers who consign with The RealReal receive a $100 store credit to shop at Stella retail stores or online, the companies say.

When designer McCartney and The RealReal’s CEO Julie Wainwright initially joined forces, it marked the first time that a luxury brand actively began pushing for items to be consigned, Forbes contributor Mario Abad wrote.

Their partnership has yielded strong results so far, the two women say. The RealReal consignors of Stella McCartney items has increased 65% and the number of the brand’s items consigned increased by 74%, year over year. Founded in 2011 as an online startup, the luxury consignment company now has store locations in cities across the United States.

The need for a shift in the industry is pressing. Last year, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Circular Fibers Initiative found that every second, humanity trashes or burns enough clothing to fill a garbage truck. Well-known fashion brands are getting called out for their practices, too. Recently that included Burberry, which came under fire for destroying finished luxury products and agreed in September to end the practice.

At COP24 in Poland, Burberry joined McCartney and dozens of other fashion industry representatives to become founding signatories of the UN Climate Change’s Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action. The charter envisions net zero emissions within the fashion industry by 2050.

“We have been working for years to ensure that our supply chains represent some of the most traceable and sustainable in fashion while also continuing to ensure that our products, which are made to last, have long lives and never end up as waste,” McCartney said earlier this year.

Her brand’s partnership with The RealReal has created an easy way for customers to participate in a circular economy, she noted.

“The success of this innovative partnership between The RealReal and Stella McCartney shows the exciting opportunities to create a thriving fashion industry, where the clothes we love never become waste,” said Francois Souchet, Make Fashion Circular lead at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

203,BAMB: could this be the new future of sustainable building?,"BAMB is on a mission. Begun in 2015 within the EU-funded Horizon 2020 programme, Buildings as Material Banks (BAMB) brings together fifteen partners from seven European countries. Its goal is a systemic shift in sustainable building.

As the name implies, BAMB reimagines a building as a dynamic repository of value, where tradable material assets can be deposited, data tracked, transferred and withdrawn.

In BAMB, whether an industry goes circular depends on value as worthless materials are waste, valuable materials are reused, recycled, recovered. More value, means less waste.

Moderating material flows, buildings can help slow the resource burn rate to meet the capacity of the planet.

Three major changes supporting the BAMB vision for sustainable building

Three major changes support the BAMB vision for circular transition: change in design culture away from linear thinking; change in value definition towards longer-term and multiple lifetimes; and change in collaboration.

To enable this shift, BAMB is developing and integrating tools, such as materials passports, reversible building design and circular building assessment.

Potential is vast, says project co-ordinator Molly Steinlage. “Pilot projects and prototyping have demonstrated BAMB tools and methodologies can prevent 75 per cent of all waste generated and raw materials used over several building transformations,” she says.

As the sector currently accounts for 35 per cent of EU waste and 30 to 50 per cent of natural resources, action is critical.

“Building passports, where resources are logged and recorded for future reuse, have great potential and will help realise long-term value in built assets,” says Susan Harris, technical director at Anthesis. She foresees more circular buildings being specified to align with corporate social responsibility in large, innovative clients.

Why BAMB and sustainable building are good for business

Until now, policy has been the main driver of construction waste disposal in sustainable building, and the London Plan should move circular economy and whole-life carbon up the agenda. Any systemic shift, though, will be business led, argues Carol Lemmens, global management consulting leader at Arup. “The first steps need to be made in business, particularly development,” he says. “Change will happen fastest, if there is a clear business case. Businesses that do not engage could lose market share, not only to incumbents, but also startups.”

Cutting cost and climate risk are business-case benefits of BAMB, says project manager Caroline Henrotay. “Waste prevention, eco-design, reuse and similar measures could bring net savings of €600 billion, or 8 per cent of annual turnover, for businesses in the EU, while reducing emissions by 2 to 4 per cent,” says Ms Henrotay.

Cost only remains a concern for traditional building methods, contends Ben Pritchard, consultant at Invennt. He says: “Instead of demolishing a building, why not take it apart and reuse the materials? The answer is simple: economics. All too often it isn’t financially viable. With the advent of modular construction techniques, this is set to change.”

Design for manufacturing and assembly, with flexibility and deconstruction built in, is the future, agrees Peter Kelly, head of sustainability at ISG. “Using off-site and digital construction techniques means buildings will be cheaper, quicker, higher quality, healthier and more productive,” he says.

Such adaptability is an innovation hotspot, says David Symons, UK director of sustainability at WSP. “Flexible designs mean lower total cost of ownership and more efficient resource use,” says Mr Symons. “The long term could see construction companies renting materials to owners; already quite common for fit-outs, with carpets, IT and desks.”

Research undertaken with Nottingham University by the Supply Chain Sustainability School, however, raises industry-wide implementation issues, says chair of the school Shaun McCarthy. “It is possible to measure circularity of a product or material, but putting this into practice is challenging. From government, down to small sub-contractors, we suffer from a shocking lack of data. Traceability technology exists, but we understand little about our supply chains below tier 1,” he says.

A whole-world view of circularity is the real reality check. At Davos in January, Circle Economy will launch its second Circularity Gap Report, developing sector-specific projections for a world only 9 per cent circular, explains director of strategic alliances Marc de Wit. “Translating the metric to the built environment in Europe and China shows the stark contrast between these world regions, and need to agree clear circularity pathways,” he concludes.

Differing rates of ongoing urbanisation underpin dramatic divergence in material consumption forecasts for 2015 to 2050, with Europe up just 14 gigatonnes (Gt) to 124Gt, but China rocketing 136 per cent from 275Gt to 650Gt. Closing the circularity gap calls for BAMB to go global, fast.",United States,2018.12

In response to the European Plastics Strategy, the report identifies the challenges to plastics circularity and defines the types of solutions needed to address them.

According to the research future research is required in three main areas, which include circularity by design, recycling and alternative feedstock.

The analysis from this report aims to help to identify priorities, projects and the level of investment needed to achieve the full circularity of plastics.

Speaking, yesterday, in Abuja at the forum tagged ‘Circular Economy and Environmental Governance’, the Minister of State for Environment, Ibrahim Usman Jibril, said for any development to be sustainable, it must go hand in hand with environmental protection.

The minister who was represented by the Director of EIA John Alonge, said the concept of green and circular economy is geared towards sustainable development.

“Green economy supports a circular economy in which the use of materials and generation of waste are minimised and any remaining waste recycled, remanufactured or retreated in a way that causes the least damage to the environment and human health,” he said.

The minister said as a clear demonstration of government’s effort to ensure the protection of the environment and achieve sustainable development is eminent in the amendment of NESREA Act by President Muhammadu Buhari.

While noting that robust regulatory framework and effective enforcement of legislation are critical means of driving green investments, the minister urged the stakeholders to immediately key into the operational guidelines of the regulations developed by NESREA.

Earlier, the Director General of NESREA, Dr Lawrence Anukam, said this year’s forum is to deepen the knowledge and understanding of circular economy and environmental governance in the country and how to mainstream it into national environmental protection.

Dr Anukam said it will, aside exploring best practices and options in environmental governance, highlight waste to wealth initiative and other opportunities inherent in the practice of circular economy.

Presenting the lead paper titled ‘Creating Wealth and Protecting the Environment for Sustainable Development: The Place of Circular Economy and Environmental Governance’, the President, Waste Management Society of Nigeria, Prof Oladele Osinbajo said a circular economy is an alternative to a traditional linear economy in which resources are kept within as long as possible, the maximum value extracted from them while in use, then products and materials recovered and regenerated at the end of its service life.

He recommended that to achieve circular economy, government should encourage repair and reuse of products to avoid waste generation and eco-design availability of spare parts, adding that consumers should be provided with reliable information on environmental impacts of product.",United States,2018.12
214,How A Doctor Helped Turn A Lagos Swamp Into A Sustainable Trade Zone,"Unlike most business people who have a doctorate, Dr Amy Jadesimi really is a doctor. The accomplished CEO of a major Nigerian logistics company – that is also the country's first privately-developed port terminal – started her working life as a medical doctor, graduating from the prestigious Oxford University, worked as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs in London and then did an MBA at Stanford University. She returned to Nigeria, where she became CEO of Lagos Deep Offshore Logistics Base (LADOL), in 2009.

Built out of a ""disused swamp"" over the last 17 years, LADOL is an industrial free zone. ""Since the largest industry in Nigeria is the petroleum sector, we started off by servicing that sector. I don’t consider myself in oil and gas at the moment, but we do service oil and gas companies,"" she told me.

LADOL is unique in many ways, argues Jadesimi (43). ""It is 100% Nigerian-owned, the first privately developed Port Terminal and the first sustainable industrial free zone. It has taken 17 years to reach this stage of development and along the way we have overcome horrendous hurdles. However, we prevailed because of our sustainable business strategy, which offers our clients 50% cost savings, while maximizing the number of Nigerians that are employed and enabling technology transfer.""

She says LADOL is building the world’s first Sustainable Industrial Special Economic Zone (SSEZ) and is using the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) ""to build a unique circular ecosystem, servicing a range of industries.""

Founded by her father in 2001, it has been operational since 2006. ""Every year since then the infrastructure and facilities have grown and expanded. The Zone now provides a 24/7 efficient, safe and secure location from which local and international companies, in a range of sectors can start operating immediately.""

In 2017, she says LADOL ""disrupted the local oil and gas market, halving the costs of local support, and creating thousands of local jobs"" and is now ""focused on attracting and servicing a range of non-oil and gas companies, in sectors ranging from technology to agriculture. The sectors identified will work together to create a circular economy within the zone.""

West Africa is one of the largest under-served markets in the world with the fastest growing population, she adds. Industrial companies working in LADOL can service this market sustainably and profitably while creating tens of thousands of jobs. As the local market grows there will be higher demand for locally produced products, a larger skilled workforce and cheaper domestic operating costs, she believes.

""LADOL is a blueprint for the Sustainable Industrialisation of Africa, turning Africa’s demographic dividend into a global wealth creation.""

Asked what has been the greatest learning experience in an accomplished career, she says: ""I learn new things from working at LADOL every day. Overall despite the challenges it has restored my faith in humanity and, from a business perspective, convinced me that for Africa to industrialize we must do it sustainably. When Africa does industrialize, it will create incredible wealth not just for our continent but also for the world.

""This will require innovation, engineering and manufacturing all taking place in African countries, with African’s leading the way. That’s what LADOL is all about – build a sustainable ecosystem that will enable companies to develop new technologies and solutions for the largest growing market in the world, operating in that market.""

Jadesimi's list of awards is as impressive as she is. She was named Young CEO of the Year by the African Leadership Forum earlier this year; a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum (WEF) in 2013; and an Archbishop Tutu Fellow in 2012, where she worked to reduce maternal mortality. She has also been named as a Rising Talent by the Women’s Forum for Economy and Society, one of 20 Youngest Power Women in Africa by Forbes in 2014, and was among the Top 25 Africans to Watch by the Financial Times.

She initially studied medicine, because ""I had an interest and aptitude for the sciences at school and I very much valued and enjoyed my time at medical school. Being a doctor has shaped every aspect of my life"".

She took a year off and went into investment banking but wasn't intending to stay. ""However, I learned a lot while I was working in investment banking and realized that I wanted to do something industrial, related to creating real jobs, so I stayed in banking for three years,"" she says. ""Goldman taught me how a range of companies work, how the markets work and prepared me to manage LADOL, a company that has a large and diverse set of departments – from security to logistics to maintenance.""

She says Stanford is a great business school for entrepreneurs and ""it prepared me to work in Nigeria – where we have to be self-reliant a lot of the time. Especially working for a company like LADOL, that is achieving so many firsts.""

""We will be expanding into a range of eight sectors, from agriculture to clean technology. In part, this is because we have identified the sectors that fit best into our circular economy within the zone. In addition, we believe that commodity-rich countries, such as Nigeria, can use their natural resources to develop a diverse set of industries. LADOL is the first and largest example of that development model in action.""",United States,2018.12
215,TBM Announces the Concept Model of Alternatives to Single-Use Plastic Bags at COP24,"TOKYO, Dec. 11, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- TBM Co., Ltd. (TBM), a company that develops, manufactures and sells paper and plastic alternative products made from a limestone-based material known as 'LIMEX', is close to launching LIMEX and Plax bags on the market as alternatives to single-use plastic bags.

Furthermore, TBM is honored to participate in COP24(Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) as a delegation of Japan.

On 12th December 2018 (Local Time 13:15-14:30), TBM will host an event, 'LIMEX - Limestone paves the road to a de-carbonised circular economy', in Japan Pavilion. Here, TBM will introduce the concept model of alternatives to single-use plastic bags made of LIMEX and Plax.
• Background

Companies today are expected to take actions against environmental issues to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and to combat plastic pollutions. Regulations against plastics have been enforced in recent months internationally and there is a growing demand for plastic alternative materials.

Anticipating the demand growth for biomass-based biodegradable resin, TBM has announced the 'Biodegradable LIMEX' at 'Brussels SDG Summit 2018,' which TBM has partnered with. The Biodegradable LIMEX is composed of limestone as the main raw material and biomass-based biodegradable resin.

Furthermore, by working together with Bioworks, TBM's subsidiary that develops a highly functional modifier for bioplastics, we will promote the market application of Plax (Modified Polylactic Acid Compound), the biomass-based new material. We strive to contribute to a decarbonized society and a circular economy. Given the situation that only 9 % of plastic waste, which cumulatively accounts for 6.3 billion tons until 2015 globally,

is recycled, TBM has partnered with local governments and companies to promote 'LIMEX Upcycle' to contribute to raising resource efficiency.
• Overview of the alternatives to single-use plastic bags made of LIMEX

Plastic packaging including single-use plastic bags accounts for the largest market share in the plastic industry. Considering the plastic waste issue, progressive regulations against single-use plastics, and greenhouse gas emissions, there is significance in replacing the conventional single-use plastic bags with more environmentally friendly material. Within this context, TBM will introduce the products below at . TBM aims for these products to be launched in the Spring of 2019.

Alternatives to single-use plastic bags made of LIMEX 

More than 50% of the composition of the material is limestone. This is achieved through the Compound Technology of LIMEX. The material has a silky and stretchy feel despite its main material, limestone. It contributes to the issues of resource depletion and environmental pollution as the usage of oil-based resources is significantly reduced in comparison to the conventional single-use plastic bag

alternatives-to-single-use-plastic.jpg 

Alternatives to single-use plastic bags made of Plax 

The bag is made from a new material by mixing biodegradable resin and limestone and applying the Plax technology. The material degrades into limestone, water, and CO2 under compost conditions, and contributes to the issue of environmental pollution. The material uses polylactic acid, a relatively hard biomass-based resin as the main material and has a silky and stretchy feel.",United States,2018.12
218,Utopies: Localizing the Sustainable Economy,"This is one of a series of interviews by students and alumni from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design (MCAD) with practitioners from the Sustainable Brands community, on a variety of ways organizations can, and are, Redesigning the Good Life.

Elisabeth Laville is the founder and chief entrepreneur of Utopies, a certified B Corp and leading European sustainable consulting firm and think tank located in Paris, France. Utopies works with businesses to integrate sustainability into all levels of a company, beginning with creating intention, then seeking business model and product innovation as an expression of that intention. Laville believes business should operate with purpose, and that purpose must be ingrained in the fabric of the organization.

Lately, Utopies has been focused on what Laville calls City X Brand partnerships – looking for ways for business to have positive, localized impacts in the communities in which they work, sell and manufacture. I caught up with Laville from her office in Paris to learn more.

What was the inspiration behind the establishment of Utopies as a consultancy?

EL: We started 25 years ago on a mission to open new paths, to help redefine the positive role of business in society, and to show that harnessing the power of business to effect social change is in a business’ interest, too. 10-20 percent of our time is devoted to our think-tank activities, exploring emerging topics or practices, publishing notes and reports to share our thoughts and learnings, launching initiatives to advance some key topics … Our initial inspiration, in fact, is very much similar to what we found in the B Corp movement, for whom we are the French country partner (and the first French certified company) — we believe a brand/company can be for profit and for purpose, which is why we focus our energy these days on three powerful pinpoints to further embed sustainability in business strategy: the convergence between sustainability and innovation; the integration of sustainability in brand positioning (with our Positive Brand® framework); and the maximization of local footprint of businesses — whether local is where they source, produce or sell.

You hosted a deep dive session on city-brand collaboration this summer at SB’18 Vancouver, the theme of which was “Redesigning the Good Life.” What does “the good life” mean to you, and what role does design play in it?

EL: I think that the Greek idea of the good life is one that allows individual progress and flourishing, positive human relations with family and friends, as well as rich experiences of what it means to be alive. If design is defined as the first signal of human intention, as Bill McDonough says, then design has a lot to do with the good life — not because a good life is necessarily full of stuff, not because it depends on the mere accumulation of material goods; but because it can be enabled by products, services and activities, provided they are designed with the intention to facilitate or activate the good life in each person. Which is the whole point of a brand purpose, as well as of sustainability, as well as of positive innovation, for example — which are key to harnessing to power of business and brands to help us, individually and collectively, achieve the good life.

Does our focus on consumption and consumers work against us in this regard?

EL: Obviously, products and activities which facilitate the good life are not necessarily in the commercial/material sphere: family and social bonds, culture, art, sport, leisure, community life or contact with the natural world are very efficient antidotes to the over-consumption frenzy of our times. Sustainable consumption is therefore not so much about maintaining our current consumption levels while switching to ‘green’ products than it is about a fundamental change in our culture and lifestyle — reconsidering the role of material consumption in our lives and in our society. It should not be seen as the unique gateway to happiness and social status any more. We should reconsider the balance in our lives between material values ​​and immaterial ones.

French psychiatrist Christophe André compares consumption to the street lamp below which a man seeks his keys: Even if he lost them elsewhere, this is where he seeks them because that is where the light is. Consumption is like light — an easy solution, accessible with the click of a mouse, without leaving home, at any time of day or night, even with money we do not have. That's why it's hard not to fall into the trap of consumption. The good life, in fact, starts by asking oneself, before buying something: ""Do I really need this? Or am I looking for an easy consolation to a deeper, inner need?”

Tell me more about your work on City x Brand partnerships.

EL: We see that “local first” is the new motto in consumers’ expectations, but also in the organization of production (custom design, small series, micro-production in fab labs or small factories, local sourcing, local certification…) or in corporate governance (local ownership, local jobs, micro-franchises, local crowdfunding, local entrepreneurs). Local also makes more sense in terms of sustainability — in terms of environmental impact, of reconnecting those who produce and those who consume in a community, of improving the resilience of local economies who are too dependent on imports & exports, and in terms of enhancing/preserving cultural diversity versus the standardization of “made in world” products.

Cities are, of course, the best place to intervene on several key sustainability issues: mobility, housing/buildings, health, food, waste, water, biodiversity, etc. On top of this, two key trends of new and more sustainable business models are, in essence, local and urban: the circular economy and the sharing economy! Last but not least, cities and local authorities are in better position to achieve systemic change: They can work on people behavior/education as well as on infrastructures and rules. They can mix a bottom-up approach (learning from what works on the field) and a top-down approach (changing regulations, norms, infrastructures, etc.).

What do you see as the role of business in driving sustainable change within communities?

EL: The role of business in driving local changes within communities is key. Obviously, the business model of such approaches needs to be further explored, because if companies want to drive change on topics related to the common good, they must do that with an ecosystem of community partners.",United States,2018.12
219,EASD - Environmental Ambassadors for Sustainable Development,"Environmental Ambassadors (EASD) are one of the newest EEB members. They are a not-for-profit professional association working in science and research, in the areas of sustainable development, environment and education. They work through consultancy, expertise, innovation, education, promotion of culture values and knowledge based advocacy.

EASD “bridge” global and European-scale environmental, climate change and sustainable development issues in focus with sub-regional south-eastern Europe challenges, and vice versa. They are “walking through actions” on thematic issues of concern, like waste and chemicals, biodiversity, climate change, circular economy concept and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in practice.

We speak to Aleksandra Mladenovic, President of EASD.

Tell us a bit more about the main activities, campaigns and/or projects you are working on at the moment?

We are working on programs: Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development and the SDGs, as well as educating the youth of today to protect the planet of tomorrow (Eco-Schools), giving our environment a voice (Young Reporters for the Environment), unlocking sustainability in the hospitality industry (Green Key) and pure water, clean coasts, safety and access for all (Blue Flag).

For 14 years we organized regional the Environment to Europe Conference. At the moment, we are working on projects: ENV-net factoring the environmental portfolio for Western Balkans and Turkey in the EU Policy Agenda, Eko-paket and The Great Plant Hunt.

What does EEB membership mean to your organisation? How does it help you in your daily work and to bring about the changes you would like to see in Europe and beyond?

We started working with the EEB as partners in an ENV.net project from 2010 until now (the project is ongoing). We just had a successful first ENV.net Regional Conference on Circular Economy in Belgrade. We also participate together in an initiative to end mercury use in dentistry, bringing this initiative to Serbia.

Through EEB membership we would like to explore the opportunity to always have fresh, relevant information on what is happening at European level, to share our knowledge and experience, as well as to learn more on environmental justice and participatory democracy.

Do you have a recent success story that you would like to share with us?

At about the same time as UN Environment started work on sustainable fashion, EASD performed activities rethinking clothing, fashion and style. We collect and use textile left-overs and unused clothes to make other textile products (we practice upcycling, rather than downcycling of textiles) with the enthusiastic help of pupils and teachers, including from a home for persons with disabilities.

We were really proud when the Secretary of the UN Alliance for Sustainable Fashion, in his speech on Innovative Solutions to Sustainable Textiles and Fashion in SEE, noted our activity as one example to illustrate innovative solutions.",United States,2018.12
220,Let's do launch: 3 startups leading in circular economy innovation | Greenbiz,"This article is drawn from the Circular Weekly newsletter from GreenBiz, running Fridays.

A circular solution is only as good as its implementation, and customer engagement is a tough nut to crack. I’m writing this week from the LAUNCH Circular Forum in Bentonville, Arkansas, having spent the week with nine innovators tackling this issue head-on, focusing on engaging customers and unlocking new business models for a circular society. Despite the fairly universal challenge of changing human behavior, I’m left feeling encouraged and heartened by their progress.

Part-incubator, part-accelerator and part pitch-fest, the two-day forum brought together a council of 30 industry leaders to provide feedback, advice and connections to the innovators as a part of LAUNCH’s 18-month program. LAUNCH engages members — including representatives from core partner companies IKEA, eBay, VF Corporation and Kvadrat — in each piece of the process from challenge framing and application review to advising the startups on their journey to scale.

With the aim of accelerating innovations to market and creating entrepreneurial ecosystems for the circular economy, LAUNCH recognizes that systems-level change requires diverse groups of stakeholders to build trust and long-term collaboration. ""By bringing people together across functions, industries and groups, in an intimate format, it helps you solve for the circular economy with unlikely partners,"" said Faith Legendre, circular economy solutions strategist at Cisco Systems, and one of my fellow councilmembers.

By bringing people together across functions, industries and groups, in an intimate format, it helps you solve for the circular economy with unlikely partners. Since its inception, LAUNCH has run 14 innovation cycles, nine of which have focused on the circular economy, including challenges on design and manufacturing; closed-loop solutions and recycling technologies; smarter chemistry; new types of materials; and green chemistry.

This year’s innovators ranged in scale, stage and scope, from frictionless clothing buy-back in the United Kingdom to incentivized recycling in Nigeria. (I encourage you to read about all nine startups here).

Here are three companies with innovative approaches to customer engagement that stood out:

OLIO: In the United States alone, we throw away 63 million tons of food annually, 85 percent of which occurs in businesses and homes. OLIO’s free, local food-sharing app connects neighbors with one another and with local stores so that surplus food easily can be shared instead of thrown away.

The app functions like a more user-friendly version of Craigslist: Users take a photo of their food on the app — anything from tonight’s leftovers to a basket of home-grown tomatoes to half a container of whatever’s in the fridge — and neighbors can request the items, all in real time. But the app isn’t just for individuals. OLIO volunteers also work with local retailers to collect and redistribute unsold food that otherwise would end up wasted. While a number of other startups are working to eliminate post-consumer food waste, this company seems to have figured out how to simplify the process of sharing the otherwise unshareable.

Library of Things: ""Why buy when you can borrow?"" asks Rebecca Trevalyan, co-founder of the United Kingdom-based startup, which rents drills, lawn mowers, carpet cleaners, projectors and other items that most people use only rarely. It’s a simple concept: rent items from a local self-serve kiosk and pay less than 10 percent of what you’d pay to buy them.

Library of Things also aims to cultivate community through do-it-yourself events and workshops, particularly given that 80 percent of users live within one mile of the Library’s pilot location, and 40 percent live just around the corner. The rental service also includes user instructions and peer reviews, and offers feedback to brands on product failures. While Library of Things is one location in London, it offers an enticing model that would make borrowing a no-brainer for many.

The primary currency in the sharing economy is trust, but 69 percent of users worry about using sharing platforms, and the number of scams has tripled in the last year, according to Deemly co-founder Sara Green Brodersen.

To enable trust and transparency in the sharing economy, Deemly aggregates user reviews and ratings across sharing platforms such as Airbnb, Lyft and eBay to create a robust user profile.

""At the heart of building a circular society is fulfilling human needs,"" Kristin Coates, executive director of LAUNCH, told me. ""That starts with building trust, rethinking the way we own things, understanding where our stuff is coming from and building experiences around the things that we own and use.""",United States,2018.12
227,Nestlé Waters North America Unveils New Plastics Packaging by 2021,"STAMFORD, Conn. – Nestlé Waters North America (NWNA), one of the leading beverage companies in North America, announced today that it will achieve 25 percent recycled plastic across its U.S. domestic portfolio by 2021. The company plans to continue expanding its use of recycled materials in the coming years, further setting an ambition to reach 50 percent recycled plastic by 2025.

The company is expanding its relationship with key supplier, Plastrec (Joliette, Canada), and working with other suppliers, to support the company’s ability to nearly quadruple its use of food-grade recycled plastic, or rPET, in less than three years. This comes on the heels of Nestlé Waters’ announcement last month about the expansion of its partnership with CarbonLITE, as the rPET supplier builds a third U.S. facility in the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania.

“We want to take the ‘single’ out of ‘single-use’ bottles. Our bottles were never meant to be thrown in the garbage — we carefully design them to be collected, recycled, and repurposed,” said Fernando Mercé, President and Chief Executive Officer of Nestlé Waters North America. “PET plastic is a valuable resource that, if recycled properly, can be used to create new bottles again and again. We’re proving that it can be done by making bottles out of other bottles, not ten years from now, but today.”

In its 2016 report, The New Plastics Economy: Rethinking the future of plastics, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation found that most plastic packaging is used only once, and that 95 percent of the value of plastic packaging material, worth $80-120 billion annually, is lost to the economy. This latest milestone positions Nestlé Waters to play a greater role in addressing the nation’s growing recycling challenges, while unlocking the full economic and environmental benefits of treating plastic as a valuable resource, rather than as a waste product.

In addition to the company’s multi-year supplier agreements, Nestlé Waters continues to make indirect investments in recycling infrastructure in the U.S. through its $6 million investment in the Closed Loop Fund. In municipalities such as Waterbury, Connecticut, the investment fund is supporting enhanced recycling programs with a goal of increasing the current city recycling rate from 6 percent to 25 percent by 2020. Just recently, Closed Loop Fund announced a $1.5 million investment in rPlanet Earth, the world’s first completely vertically integrated manufacturer of post-consumer recycled PET.

Nestlé Waters also supports recycling collection programs through organizations like Keep America Beautiful, including an integrated recycling education and awareness initiative for the 10,000 students affected by the Flint water crisis. The company was also the first beverage company in North America to add How2Recycle information on the labels of its major U.S. brands. These labels include a reminder for consumers to empty the bottle and replace the cap before recycling.

“Through long-term supplier contracts and our commitment to supporting initiatives to improve collection rates, we are helping to stimulate a more robust recycling market, and unlock the potential of a circular economy here in the U.S.,” said Mercé.

Earlier this year, as a result of Nestlé Waters’ existing relationship with rPET supplier Plastrec, the company unveiled a new 100 percent rPET Nestlé Pure Life® bottle, the only major nationally distributed bottled water on the market to be made using 100 percent recycled plastic.

In California, Nestlé Waters is leading the industry in its use of recycled plastic: more than 42% of the plastic the company uses across all brands sold in California is made from rPET – more than any other beverage manufacturer in the state. In fact, all single-serve bottles of Arrowhead® Brand Mountain Spring Water and Nestlé® Pure Life® Purified Water produced in California are made with 50 percent recycled plastic.

“The planet has a problem with plastic pollution. If plastic is going to survive as a packaging material it must demonstrate closed-loop capability,” said Mark Murray, executive director of the environmental group Californians Against Waste. “Nestlé Waters has embraced this responsibility by accelerating their use of recycled content over the next 3 years and their commitment to reach 50 percent by 2025. Nestlé Waters is setting the example that the rest of the beverage industry must embrace.”

This latest milestone is part of parent company Nestlé SA’s broader ambition to develop a circular economy for plastics, and to prevent packaging from ending up as litter. The global company recently announced that it has signed the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment to work collectively on solutions that address the root causes of plastics waste and pollution. Nestlé Waters North America’s packaging, which is predominantly made using PET plastic, is already 100 recyclable, and the company views its push toward using more recycled materials to be its next phase in making its packaging more sustainable and addressing the issue of plastic waste.

The partnership also complements the company’s recent agreement with recycled PET plastic (rPET) supplier CarbonLITE, enabling it to establish a third rPET plant in Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, US.

It is also part of its parent company Nestlé’s goal to develop a circular economy for plastics and reduce packaging litter.

Last month, Nestlé signed the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment in a move to tackle environmental pollution caused by plastic waste.



Nestlé Waters North America president and CEO Fernando Mercé said: “We want to take the ‘single’ out of ‘single-use’ bottles. Our bottles were never meant to be thrown in the garbage, we carefully design them to be collected, recycled, and repurposed.

“PET plastic is a valuable resource that, if recycled properly, can be used to create new bottles again and again.”

“PET plastic is a valuable resource that, if recycled properly, can be used to create new bottles again and again. We’re proving that it can be done by making bottles out of other bottles, not ten years from now, but today.”

The beverage maker plans to expand the use of recycled materials to 50% by 2025 in the coming years.

Nestlé Waters is also offering a $6m investment through the Closed Loop Fund in a move to recycle infrastructure in the US.

The fund focuses on supporting enhanced recycling programmes in municipalities such as Waterbury, Connecticut, with a goal of increasing the city recycling rate from 6% to 25% by 2020.",United States,2018.12

233,"South East, Southern European Environment Ministers Commit to Tackle Pollution | News | SDG Knowledge Hub | IISD","5 December 2018: Environment ministers and high-level government officials from Southern and South East Europe agreed on more than 20 tangible solutions to tackle pollution at a ministerial conference, including reducing all types of marine litter and supporting waste prevention, reuse, recycling and resource recovery to minimize environmental impacts and increase green jobs to support a green economy transition.

Conference participants agreed on a joint vision to incentivize and redirect investment towards promoting waste prevention, recycling and other non-polluting activities and increasing the monitoring of transboundary pollution.

Officials from Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Italy, Turkey, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Hungary, Greece, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Albania participated in the Ministerial Conference on ‘Innovative Solutions to Pollution in South East and Southern Europe,’ which took place from 4-5 December in Belgrade, Serbia. The Government of Serbia and the Italian Ministry of Environment, Land and Sea organized the conference with support from the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment).

In the ‘Joint Regional Vision on Innovative Solutions to Pollution,’ environment ministers and representatives state their determination to support the development and dissemination of innovative solutions in the field of pollution prevention, monitoring and reduction and to strengthen “the regional voice of the environment” by taking specific actions. These actions include: encouraging environmental policy interventions at all levels by integrating existing policy instruments and creating new policies and tools addressing pollution and supporting inter-ministerial cooperation for improved policy coherence; fostering the development of innovative solutions addressing pollution, supporting green and environmentally sound technologies and promoting the sustainable use of natural capital, including ecosystem-based solutions to tackle pollution; promoting a circular economy by supporting sustainable consumption and production (SCP) patterns in the region, encouraging sustainable lifestyles and making it easier to reduce the use of, reuse and recycle materials, contributing to minimized waste generation and disposal; and accelerating implementation of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) aimed at prevention, control and reduction of pollution, including through supporting the ratification processes of the Minamata Convention on Mercury.

Signatories further commit to, : encouraging sustainable and innovative financing schemes and private sector-led actions towards sustainable solutions on and investments in non-polluting activities; enhancing regional cooperation in addressing transboundary pollution; encouraging establishment of and strengthening regional partnerships to promote exchange of experiences, transfer of clean technology and accessible use of best available techniques; enhancing and promoting cooperation with and among local authorities to support development of innovative strategies and plans; and strengthening engagement with the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA). Signatories request UNEP to : support the Western Balkan countries’ capacities in implementing the SDGs; and establish a UNEP sub-regional presence for facilitating exchange of information and creation of partnerships. Government officials also recognize the need to improve availability of and access to relevant environmental data on pollution.

Conference participants discussed a report by UNEP, titled ‘The State of Pollution in the Western Balkans and Current Challenges.’ The report finds that countries in the region rank among the worst in Europe for air pollution and face serious challenges related to air and water pollution, soil contamination and unregulated waste dumping. For instance, 20-40 percent of inhabitants do not have municipal waste collection, which contributes to widespread illegal waste dumping and plastic pollution that ends up in the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea. The report also raises concern about the region’s energy plans, noting that all countries in the area plan to build new coal power plans. The report argues that the “economic and environmental reasoning behind this is questionable,” with solar and wind energy becoming cheaper than coal or hydropower. The report recommends that countries, : implement economic instruments, such as an excise tax on “dirty fuels” to address pollution and fund green incentives; introduce environmental objectives into energy and transport policies; and expand their networks of marine and terrestrial protected areas.

236,How I Became Passionate About the Circular Economy,"In the U.S., 81 percent of Generation Z say they’re looking for purpose in their work, according to a recent report from American Express. Many are finding that purpose in the corporate responsibility and sustainability fields. As this next generation enters the workforce, we wanted to find out what draws them to careers in this space, so we are publishing a series of personal essays from young professionals, whether they are millennials or Gen Z, to learn about what their new corporate responsibility or sustainability careers mean for them.

I began my academic career at Nassau Community College on Long Island, New York, studying liberal arts and advanced mathematics. I then transferred to CUNY Baruch College with the intention of becoming an actuary, but ended up obtaining my bachelor’s in public policy with a focus on New York City’s government. I held internships with the NYC Council as well as the U.S. Senate, where I had the opportunity to work on constituent affairs and legislative research.

My first professional job was at a boutique government relations consulting firm with a wide breadth of clients seeking strategies to navigate through NYC government. There I worked as a scheduler and office manager, liaising between clients and public offices, and enjoyed the relationship management aspect of job. My next role was with another government relations consulting firm that focused on security and public safety. In this role I provided clients and management with policy research, analysis of current events and assistance cultivating long-term strategic partnerships.

Most recently, I worked in the membership department at a trade association that represents the financial industry. The commonality between these jobs was client relationship management and the intersection of the public and private sectors. Although I enjoyed the high-level themes of my work, I was seeking to make an impact and support organizations that proactively design sustainability into their operations.

On a personal note, Earth Day is my birthday, I practice yoga, I try to minimize my consumption, dispose of items responsibly and I find myself concerned with the unnoticed effects everyday lifestyle choices. I wanted my work to reflect my values. In an effort to understand sustainability issues better – and gain some credentials in this field – I decided to leave my Wall Street job when I was admitted to graduate school.

Recently, I obtained my master of science in environmental management and sustainability from both James Madison University and the University of Malta. This dual degree took place in Malta and emphasized cross-cultural project management, system dynamics and integrated technologies for management.

Graduate school completely changed the way I think about sustainability issues, and equipped me with a toolkit for analyzing environmental management challenges and implementing holistic solutions. Malta is a country that struggles with water scarcity, and also has had to take on several water pollution challenges.

Upon reflecting on my time in Malta, my takeaway definition of sustainability is “seeking to balance environmental, social, and economic issues within a cultural context.”

Throughout our coursework we examined various case studies about sustainability, including the fashion industry’s impact, which ranges from social and economic issues to environmental devastation. It’s clear the apparel and textile industry is particularly unsustainable in terms of its waste and freshwater use. The culmination of my graduate work – my thesis, which is published here – is a qualitative analysis of traceability technology (as in blockchain) integrated in textile supply chain management to enhance sustainability by mitigating risks and capitalizing on circular economy opportunities.

My aspiration is to address waste diversion issues in a meaningful way. The circular economy offers one solution to waste management challenges, which are intrinsically linked to other sustainability issues such as water scarcity and social justice.

What I’d love to see included in this conversation is the fact that everyone can win with circular economy solutions. This does not need to be a zero-sum game. Who pays for landfills? Who pays for environmental remediation when there’s an emergency? Taxpayers.

Who needs clean freshwater? Everyone.

Waste is a huge and very unsexy issue. I want to harness my experience in the overlap of the public and private spheres and client relationship management and integrate it with my recent academic investigations. Ultimately, education (what to do with “waste”?) and consumer behavior change (consume less, dispose responsibly) is critical to whatever system we adopt. Now, I’m seeking to develop and support business cases for circular systems with an emphasis on proactive design choices that consider requirements for all stakeholders.",United States,2018.12
243,Styrenics Circular Solutions Incorporates as Independent Organisation for the Styrenics Value Chain to Advance Circularity,"- Incorporation enables the inclusion of value chain partners to jointly power innovative recycling solutions and resource efficiency for styrenic polymers

Styrenics Circular Solutions (SCS), the joint industry initiative to drive the shift to a more circular economy for styrenics, today announced its incorporation as an independent organisation and collaboration platform.

SCS' four founding members, INEOS Styrolution, Total, Trinseo and Versalis (Eni), signed the SCS incorporation agreement to further solidify their commitment to transform the styrenics industry by unlocking polystyrene's unique circularity potential. Game-changing technologies will enable polystyrene, EPS and other styrenic based plastics to be fully recycled so that they can be used again and again in high-quality applications, ultimately also for food contact.

The newly incorporated platform will enable the inclusion of new members across the styrenics value chain and waste management stream, as well as build on the collaboration with long-standing partners, such as PlasticsEurope, and new partners alike. SCS will place a strong focus on engaging waste collection and sorting partners to recover more polystyrene and EPS-based products. Thereby, SCS strives to build a close link between waste stream volumes of relevant quality and its high-tech recycling processes.

""Today's signing marks an important milestone of our voluntary pledge,"" comments Jens Kathmann, Secretary General of SCS. ""The potential for polystyrene recycling is enormous. We know that polystyrene has an unparalleled capacity for closed-loop recycling, when properly collected and sorted. The SCS founding members, are fully committed to our objective of full circularity. We therefore welcome partners across the entire value chain, including recyclers, waste management companies, converters and brand owners, to join SCS to link waste streams to our innovative recycling technologies.""

The Styrenics Circular Solutions is a joint industry initiative to increase the circularity of styrenics.

The initiative engages the entire value chain in the development and industrialisation of new recycling technologies and solutions. It aims to strengthen the sustainability of styrenic products while improving resource efficiency within the circular economy.",United States,2018.12
245,Nestlé Waters NA packaging to reach 25% rPET content by 2021,"Nestlé Waters North America (Stamford, CT), announced December 10 that it will achieve 25% recycled plastic content (PCR) across its U.S. domestic portfolio by 2021. NWNA plans to continue expanding its use of recycled materials in the coming years, further setting an ambition to reach 50 percent recycled plastic by 2025.

The company is expanding its relationship with key supplier, Plastrec (Joliette, Canada) and other suppliers to support the company’s ability to nearly quadruple its use of food-grade recycled plastic, or rPET, in less than three years. This follows last month’s announcement of the expansion of its partnership with CarbonLITE (see Nestlé Waters signs agreement with recycled PET supplier CarbonLITE) , as the rPET supplier builds a third U.S. facility in the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania.

“We want to take the ‘single’ out of ‘single-use’ bottles,” says Fernando Mercé, President and Chief Executive Officer of Nestlé Waters North America. Our bottles were never meant to be thrown in the garbage—we carefully design them to be collected, recycled, and repurposed. PET plastic is a valuable resource that, if recycled properly, can be used to create new bottles again and again. We’re proving that it can be done by making bottles out of other bottles, not ten years from now, but today.”

In its 2016 report, The New Plastics Economy: Rethinking the future of plastics, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation found that most plastic packaging is used only once, and that 95 percent of the value of plastic packaging material, worth $80-120 billion annually, is lost to the economy. This latest milestone positions Nestlé Waters to play a greater role in addressing the nation’s growing recycling challenges, while unlocking the full economic and environmental benefits of treating plastic as a valuable resource, rather than as a waste product.

In addition to the company’s multi-year supplier agreements, Nestlé Waters continues to make indirect investments in recycling infrastructure in the U.S. through its $6 million investment in the Closed Loop Fund. In municipalities such as Waterbury, Connecticut, the investment fund is supporting enhanced recycling programs with a goal of increasing the current city recycling rate from 6 percent to 25 percent by 2020. Just recently, Closed Loop Fund announced a $1.5 million investment in rPlanet Earth, the world’s first completely vertically integrated manufacturer of post-consumer recycled PET.

Nestlé Waters also supports recycling collection programs through organizations like Keep America Beautiful, including an integrated recycling education and awareness initiative for the 10,000 students affected by the Flint water crisis. The company was also the first beverage company in North America to add How2Recycle information on the labels of its major U.S. brands. These labels include a reminder for consumers to empty the bottle and replace the cap before recycling.

“Through long-term supplier contracts and our commitment to supporting initiatives to improve collection rates, we are helping to stimulate a more robust recycling market, and unlock the potential of a circular economy here in the U.S.,” says Mercé.

Earlier this year, as a result of Nestlé Waters’ existing relationship with rPET supplier Plastrec, the company unveiled a new 100% rPET Nestlé Pure Life bottle, the only major nationally distributed bottled water on the market to be made using 100 percent recycled plastic.

In California, Nestlé Waters is leading the industry in its use of recycled plastic: more than 42% of the plastic the company uses across all brands sold in California is made from rPET– more than any other beverage manufacturer in the state. In fact, all single-serve bottles of Arrowhead® Brand Mountain Spring Water and Nestlé Pure Life Purified Water produced in California are made with 50% recycled plastic.

“The planet has a problem with plastic pollution,” said Mark Murray, executive director of the environmental group Californians Against Waste. “If plastic is going to survive as a packaging material it must demonstrate closed-loop capability. Nestlé Waters has embraced this responsibility by accelerating their use of recycled content over the next 3 years and their commitment to reach 50 percent by 2025. [It’s] an example that the rest of the beverage industry must embrace.”

This latest milestone is part of parent company Nestlé SA’s broader ambition to develop a circular economy for plastics, and to prevent packaging from ending up as litter. The global company recently announced that it has signed the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment to work collectively on solutions that address the root causes of plastics waste and pollution. Nestlé Waters North America’s packaging, which is predominantly made using PET plastic, is already 100% recyclable, and the company views its push toward using more recycled materials to be its next phase in making its packaging more sustainable and addressing the issue of plastic waste.",United States,2018.12

250,Importance of rare earth metals mining makes it into COP24,"In a series of talks that took place within the COP24 summit in Katowice, Poland, defenders of the circular economy highlighted the importance of including mining of rare earth metals into their discussions.

Based on a research document focused on the Netherlands and prepared by consulting and venture building firm Metabolic, the experts agreed that resources are the missing link in the climate debate. In their view, this is a mistake because rare earth metals are needed to build enough solar panels and wind turbines to meet the Paris Climate Agreement targets.

In detail, the report found that achieving such goals requires major inputs of iron and steel for the foundation and shaft of wind turbines. At the same time, elements such as silicon, copper, lead, and zinc are needed. However, their supply is more or less guaranteed given that they have been used in large quantities for decades.

Other metals, such as neodymium, terbium, indium, dysprosium, and praseodymium, would need to be mined in larger quantities and production would need to grow as much as 12-fold by 2050 compared to today’s output.

Besides being key components of wind turbine and solar technologies, these metals are used in electronic equipment like hard drives, loudspeakers, and LCD-screens.

Neodymium, for example, is used for permanent magnets in wind turbines and in electric vehicles. Using the Netherlands’ demand as a case study, the document states that the country will have about 1.2 million electric cars in 2030, resulting in an average demand of 100,000 electric cars per year. With a neodymium demand of 1.46 kg per car, the result is a total demand of 146 tonnes per year. In other words, the Dutch demand for neodymium – only related to the energy transition – would amount to 4% of the global annual production.

Just focusing on electric vehicles, Metabolic expects total lithium and cobalt demand to increase by a factor of 25 towards 2050.

Keeping these forecasts in mind, the consultancy proposes the idea of developing a European mining industry, given that the continent is almost completely dependent on foreign supply of critical metals, despite the fact that it hosts some reserves.

The report also suggests enabling the production of renewable electricity with a smaller demand for critical metals and increasing circular design and recycling efforts by embedding circular design principles into the production of wind turbines and PV panels, to enable future reuse of components and materials at end-of-life.",United States,2018.12
256,Commonwealth must not take a back seat on new waste policy,"The Australian Local Government Association (ALGA) is urging for continued national leadership from the Commonwealth to ensure consistent intergovernmental policy for waste management and resource recovery following endorsement of the new National Waste Policy (NWP) at the 8th Meeting of Environment Ministers in Canberra last Friday.

ALGA President, Mayor David O’Loughlin, attended the meeting and said: “We congratulate the Environment Ministers on the delivery of Australia’s new National Waste Policy, but the job is not done yet.

“The new policy may be full of good intentions and strong principles, but has as much backbone as you’ll find in the average plastic shopping bag.

“Urgent action is needed as Ministers themselves have acknowledged.

“Industry and communities need to see real on-ground action and there is a critical need for national leadership to maintain a unified approach.

“Dedicated and nationally-coordinated action on recycling will give industry the signal it needs to increase investment in sustainable resource recovery and support the nation’s move towards a circular economy.

“89% of Australians have indicated that they want recycled content included in government procurement.

“It is essential that councils, federal, state and territory governments increase their procurement of goods and infrastructure that incorporate recycled materials – such as those used in road bases – which will help to reduce items entering the waste stream in the first place and create jobs.”

Mayor O’Loughlin said that there are already many local governments paying for innovative products made entirely or partly from recycled materials, but that state and territory governments also need to take the necessary steps to help the recyclate industry sector go further.

“There is more than $1 billion sitting in state waste levy funds that could be invested in industry innovation, pilot projects and financially supporting transitions from virgin product feedstock to recycled feedstock.

“There’s another $1 billion to be collected next year, but the meeting achieved no strong policy commitment, no agreement on concrete targets or timeframes, miniscule investment and little progress.

258,Michigan’s Bottle Deposit Law Celebrates 40 Years of Keeping Michigan Clean,"The Michigan Beverage Container Act, better known as Michigan's Bottle Bill, recently celebrated 40 years in existence at a celebration in Lansing sponsored by Schupan & Sons, whose Schupan Recycling Division is the largest independent producer of used beverage containers in the nation.

Governor William Milliken was the architect of - and inspiration for - Michigan's landmark bottle deposit law.

“Governor Milliken had asked for a bottle bill in 1971 in his state of the state address,” says Bill Rustem, who worked form Milliken at the time. “We could never get it through the legislature. He tried and tried and tried. What happened in 1976 is we thought we had the votes to get it out of a house committee, and at the last minute one legislator went south on us, frankly. We couldn't get it out of committee.” So it went on the ballot for citizens to decide. And it passed. It went into effect on December 3, 1978.

Some Michigan legislators are pushing legislation to repeal the state's 10 cent deposit law on bottles and cans.

“Despite the opposition to the deposit law, it’s really revered and loved by Michiganders, over 90 percent of folks really like the law,” says Tom Emmerich, chief operating officer for Schupan & Sons and president of Schupan Recycling. “It works really well. Even those who are opposed to the law have done a wonderful job of working with the recycling community to evolve and improve the process from day one. I mean, it is light years different today than what it was back in 1979 when they first started picking up containers.”

Emmerich doesn't buy the argument put forth by those wanting to repeal the law that it negatively impacts Michigan's lowest in the Great Lakes region recycling rate of 15 percent.

“Oh, no I don't. Quite frankly, I think the answer is really simple. The reason that our rate is so much lower than other states is we don't invest in it,” he says. “States like Minnesota and Wisconsin are investing around $20 million a year back into their recycling infrastructure, and they ban things from landfills that we don't ban here in the state of Michigan. So, if you really want to increase the recycling rate in the state of Michigan, I believe you need to take more drastic measures, maybe at the state level, where you ban certain things from landfills and you do need to look at tipping fees. A lot of out of state waste comes in and takes away from our abilities and desire to recycle.”

Susan Collins is president of the Container Recycling Institute.

“The idea of getting rid of the law goes not only counter to what's going on in the United States, but so counter to what's going on in the world.”

Collins believes the bottle bill has worked so well that many Michiganders have come to take its positive impacts for granted.

“If you have a really good program in your state, this happens all the time, people don't even know it. They just take it for granted and they don't understand what the benefits are. It's just something they have always done and they love it. It scores well in opinion polls, but they have no idea the magnitude of the good they’re doing by participating in a deposit law.”

Dan Eichinger is executive director of MUCC, that's the Michigan United Conservation Clubs. He believes improving Michigan’s recycling rate is vital, but repealing the bottle bill is the wrong approach.

“This is an extraordinarily popular program, it's something that the people of the state of Michigan have bought in to, it's one of those uniquely Michigan cultural things that we have here. I just think it's important to remind people about that, particularly when we've got lawmakers who are reaching and grasping at anything to try and change the way that we do recycling and make some changes to the bottle deposit law to advance this argument that it's outdated, that it's unneeded, and that kind of thing.”

Marc Schupan is chief executive officer of Schupan & Sons. For Schupan, one of the ways to increase Michigan's recycling rate is finding ways to create products that use recycled material.

“Just collecting is not recycling and especially in the environment we're in today, we have to be very careful of that, very careful that we think collection is recycling,” he says. “When water bottles go into the landfill, that's like throwing oil in the landfill. We know some day this cannot continue.”

Chris Kolb is president and CEO of the Michigan Environmental Council. For him, there isn't anything magical about improving Michigan's recycling rate.

“If you look at states that have high recycling rates, there are really basic things they do. They have a stated goal. They have a plan to meet that goal. They have revenue to pay for that plan and to implement it. And then they review how they're doing and make adjustments to go towards their goal,” he says. “So, it's nothing magical. It's not a question of recycling or bottle bill, it's recycling AND bottle bill.

“How many policies that are forty years old are still as effective and efficient as Michigan's bottle bill. It's a testament to good public policy and getting good results. If I had an issue as a politician that had that type of effectiveness, a 96 percent recovery with a 92 percent public support, I'd run every time on that.”

Heiner Bevers is president of TOMRA North America, which designs, manufactures and sells reverse vending machines for automated collection of used beverage containers. He says bottle bills like Michigan's are spreading around the world. He believes the world needs to be moving faster toward a return to a circular economy.

“The world for many years, actually was a circular economy, we didn't call it that but the way our ancestors have operated, they basically reused material; things were reused. Only recently for maybe the last 150, 200 years the world has turned from a circular economy to something we call a linear economy. Extracting materials, producing things out of these materials, and then putting it into waste. So we need to actually come back to the things which were done 200 or 300 years ago where things are reused. And if we look for a reference point, we just have to look into nature.

“Nature doesn't waste anything. Nature recycles everything. I think that's something we have to pursue. We’ll probably never be as perfect as nature, but we should at least strive to get as close as possible.”

Collins is seeing two emerging national trends in recycling.

“One is to follow Michigan's lead and impose a dime deposit instead of a nickel deposit. Everybody recognizes that the reason Michigan's rate is the highest is because of the dime deposit. The other thing that's going on is that these deposit laws, when they were passed, we didn't have a lot of non-carbonated beverages like we do now. Now we've got water and tea and sports drinks and energy drinks and those things weren't anticipated when the deposit law was passed in Michigan. So six of the other ten states with a deposit law have recognized that we need to expand to cover all beverages, not just carbonated beverages. They've already gone through that process. So in that area, Michigan is sort of behind the curve a little bit. So that would be what's next for Michigan, and that's definitely a trend in several states.”

Bill Milliken, Jr. was on hand at the event and says his dad is glad to know that so many people believe in the bottle bill he worked so hard for.

“I know that dad and my mother, Helen, were both very committed to a bottle bill,” he says. “They had a hard time understanding why there was resistance to it. It seemed like common sense applied to this pretty easily. It has since, but it was tough sledding back then. He will be thrilled to hear that there were so many people here who believe in what they worked so hard for then.

“He grew up in Traverse City; he's third generation Traverse City. The outdoors and the Great Lakes, he simply took for granted. I think when he came to Lansing and found out that not everybody grew up with Grand Traverse Bay in front of them that he wanted to see what he could do to make those kinds of resources widely available and preserve them.”

267,"Experts at COP24 Address Circular Economy Issues, Share Recommendations for Biz","At the COP24 climate summit in Katowice on December 7, a coalition of European circular hotspots presented evidence and best practices of the circular economy as a means to bridge the gap in the climate agenda and identify where there is potential for scaling up.

Forward-looking members from the business and science communities were invited by the coalition to outline the significant contribution the transition to a circular economy, which aims to decouple economic growth from the use of natural resources and ecosystems by using those resources more effectively, has towards reaching the climate goals. The circular economy not only contributes towards CO2 reduction, it also keeps materials in the loop and is restorative in nature. The greenhouse gas emission (GHG) reduction potential is not cost driven but based on sound and inspiring business models that have significant potential in every market segment and can work both in developed and developing nations. The organizers aim to send a strong signal to the formal COP representatives about the importance of adopting circular economy strategies that can start today.

Here is a sampling of what they had to say:

Kari Herlevi, Project Director, Circular economy at Sitra: “Making better use of the materials that already exist in the economy, using circular business models and having greater material efficiency can take EU industry halfway towards net-zero emissions in an economically attractive way.”

A large part of CO2 emissions that the world agreed to reduce in the Paris Agreement is associated with producing materials. Sitra presented its recent study The Circular Economy – a Powerful Force for Climate Mitigation made in collaboration with European Climate Foundation and Material Economics which explored whether we can make better use of the materials already produced, and so reduce the need for new production. The conclusion: demand-side measures can take us more than halfway to net-zero emissions from EU industry and hold as much promise as those on the supply side.

The concept of the circular economy creates these opportunities through strategies such as recirculating a larger share of materials, reducing waste in production, replacing heavy products and structures with low weight alternatives, extending the life-times of products, and deploying new business models based around sharing of cars, buildings, and more.

Eva Gladek, CEO Metabolic: “It is essential for us to manage materials in a circular fashion in order to ensure that we have enough for the technologies critical to a low-carbon future.”

That resources are the missing link in the Climate Debate also came forward out of new research from Metabolic and Copper8 – Metal Demand for Renewable Electricity Generation in the Netherlands – that identified challenges in supplying the rare earth metals needed to build enough solar panels and wind turbines to meet Paris Climate agreement targets. The report found that achieving the Paris agreement goals requires the global production of some metals to grow as much as 12-fold by 2050. Circular manufacturing of renewable energy technology is one part of the solution.

National Governments signed the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015. They can set targets, support frontrunners and create financial and legal incentives. National governments are wise to integrate the Circular Economy in the implementation of the Paris agreement. Countries like the Netherlands set directions and boundaries. The Netherlands wants to be fully circular in 2050 and halve the non-renewable resource use by 2030. Whatever ambition a national government sets, in the end it is up to business to introduce innovations and actions to scale-up.

Harald Tepper: Program Lead Circular Economy at Philips: “Philips aims to deliver 15% of total revenues from circular products and services by 2020. Furthermore, the company has pledged that it will take back and repurpose all the large medical systems that its customers are prepared to return to it by 2020, and that it will extend these practices to all professional equipment by 2025.”

Philips strives to make the world healthier and more sustainable through meaningful innovation. As a leading health technology company, the journey to a circular economy is core to that vision, as is the ambition to become CO2-neutral in its operations by 2020. In 2017, the company published its first, externally audited Environmental Profit & Loss account (EP&L), as part of the Annual Report. The EP&L shows a substantial contribution from materials and components across the supply chain, thus further emphasizing the importance of a transition to the circular economy.

Philips has fully embraced circular economy principles, because of its benefits for society, and because of a strong believe that it is a driver for innovation and economic growth. That’s why it is actively working with other front-running companies, governments, and NGOs to advance the circular economy globally in the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE).

Jakub Wójcik, Vice-Chairman of Izodom Company: “Constructing a new building is similar to sending a letter into the future. Traditional buildings are like sending a gift with a growing bill to pay – an energy bill. Our children will be forced to supply them with their limited energy resources, as well as, they need to deal with the remains of our ‘gift.’ We work to make this bill the smallest possible and the burden with construction waste avoidable.”

The importance of the built environment sector for achieving circular economy is huge. It is the sector with the largest materials flows in the economy. Buildings and infrastructure have a very long lifetime and they are a dominant part of the footprint of a city. Today’s focus is predominantly on supply of renewable energy. There is far less focus on minimization of demand for energy. Energy loss related to cooling in hot countries is probably as impactful as energy loss related to heating in cold countries.

Izodom focuses on an even larger part of the lifetime footprint of a building by introducing smartly designed and effective thermal insulation building materials that have been produced locally and can even be reused after the life-cycle of a building into a new function. Izodom managed to send 19,000 buildings into the next century and saved, between 1990 and 2018, roughly nine million metric tons of CO2, which would have been emitted if those homes were built traditionally.

Arve Ulriksen, CEO Mo Industripark: “Most things start with a vision, and the goal is to set up your business in a way that enables you to fulfill your vision. It’s when we dare to say them out loud that the real work begins, and the pressure is on to fulfill them… More sectors need to step it up and vocalize a vision when it comes to mitigating climate change through circular economy. We need to be bold and think big if individual small contributions are to make up a cohesive whole.”

An industrial symbiosis constitutes a local partnership where partners provide, share and reuse resources to create shared value. The purpose of industrial symbiosis is to create loops of technical or biological materials while minimising the leakage and waste in the loops – demonstrating some key parts of a circular economy, at a local scale.

Mo Industrial Park is the largest industrial cluster in Arctic Norway; 108 different companies within the process industry, marine sector, mining, datacenters, the service sector and many more enjoy an advanced industrial symbiosis. Some overarching achievements include the recovery of heat from the industry equivalent to the annual energy consumption of the city of 24,000 inhabitants. This recycled energy is used to produce smolt within the park and district heating in the city of Mo i Rana, ensuring ice free streets and heated sports arenas, hospitals and other public buildings.

Also, when it comes to by-products from the process industry, Mo Industripark utilizes dust, slag, CO-gas and refractory materials over and over, making sure they stay in a circular loop.

Callum Blackburn, Head of Policy, Research and Evaluation at Zero Waste Scotland: “The circular economy isn’t just about tackling climate change – it will also be a boost to local economies. We have identified a wide range of exciting business opportunities in the emerging circular economy, which could be worth £1bn to the economy of two of Scotland’s regions alone.”

In cities, everything comes together. Cities are the place of action. With large populations and an abundance of resources in a small geographic area, cities offer an ideal location for new circular economy business models. The volume of businesses and people also give sufficient scale to enable the change. A key strand of Zero Waste Scotland’s circular economy strategy is to take a cities and regions approach, as it allows for a cross-sectoral focus, taking advantage of the benefits and potential synergies between businesses from different sectors.

Recent reports focusing on Scottish cities and regions from Zero Waste Scotland have demonstrated the scale of potential opportunities. Going forward we must align public, private and academic sectors to fully exploit the opportunities that the circular economy offers.

In all, the circular economy is the way forward to decouple economic growth from the use of natural resources. It contributes significantly to the Climate Goals not as a cost factor but by viable business models. A circular economy transition can start small but has a tremendous potential to scale up. Unleashing the potential requires eliminating circular economy barriers and stimulating drivers to make the transition happen.

Recommendations that come forward when considering the many circular economy cases that are operational today include:
• Many governments have adopted legislation to improve waste management—just one aspect of circular economy and often not tied to climate policy—but few have adopted legislation that tries to reduce waste holistically and at the source or in conjunction with climate action. Circular economy policies targeted to the source of waste include lifetime extension, modular design, design for disassembly, material and resource passports, and international cooperation on supply chains.
• As industry associations and the European Commission consider new mid-century ‘roadmaps’ for industry, they should include circular economy measures for cost-effective ways to achieve deep emissions cuts.

Policy levers for a circular economy and climate measures can work in tandem.
• More emphasis on design. In the design phase there is a high likelihood that 80% of the environmental footprint can be determined.
• Incentives for green public and private procurement help create demand for circular products. Public procurement is 20% of EU GDP and can create a huge pull factor for new circular innovations.
• Extended producer responsibility schemes introduce life-cycle thinking in manufacturing, in supporting the marketing of better products, and in promoting responsible interaction between producers and consumers. When set up in close alignment between government, producers and taking consumers into account they have proven to be effective in the European Union and in front- running countries such as France.
• Supportive tax reform can make it more attractive for companies to adopt circular business models, even if these are more labor intensive.
• None Capacity building should step away from a focus on the sources of emissions to developing an understanding of how resources, both raw materials and fuels, are used to deliver services to society. This requires a metabolic analysis, a mapping of the flows and stocks of materials and energy, aiming for improvement of the system and the way it responds to societal needs.
• Aligning standards and definitions across borders – for example, regarding a waste and a resource status.

Cities as the place of action
• None Whereas national governments set the ambition and create the boundaries, and companies have to do the major part of the scaling-up, the place where circular action can start and grow is often in cities. Local governments should bring stakeholders together, share best practices, show the potential and give examples.
• None The circular economy is a new way of designing, producing, consuming and dealing with waste. It is about innovation (like the tremendous opportunities of digitization) and new cross-sectoral collaboration.

The greenhouse gas emission (GHG) reduction potential of circular economy is not cost-driven but based on sound and inspiring business models that have significant potential in every market segment and can work both in developed and developing nations. A circular economy is also an opportunity to create jobs and raise standards of living. It requires that we continue to raise awareness and educate the leaders for tomorrow.",United States,2018.12

272,"Trending: Regenerative Sourcing, Circular Models Revamping Fashion","This week, two fashion giants with extensive brand portfolios announced partnerships that show promise for cleaning up “dirty fashion.”

Kering, Savory Institute team up for first verified regenerative sourcing in fashion

Luxury fashion giant Kering has announced a new collaboration with The Savory Institute — a nonprofit that facilitates large-scale regeneration of the world’s grasslands through holistic management — to illustrate the positive impact regenerative agriculture can have in the fashion industry. A first in fashion and luxury, Kering has become a Frontier Founder under Savory’s Land to Market™ program — the world’s first verified regenerative sourcing solution for meat, dairy, wool and leather — to advocate regenerative sourcing solutions and expand the regenerative agriculture framework in fashion’s global supply chains.

Through its use of agricultural raw materials, the fashion industry and its supply chains are directly linked to the degradation of soil, destruction of forests and natural ecosystems, and biodiversity loss. Regenerative agriculture can protect and reverse this environmental degradation, including restoring healthy soil, which removes CO2 from the atmosphere and acts as a carbon sink for mitigating climate change. The inclusion of regenerative raw materials is also one of the three key principles to building a circular economy in fashion.

Consequently, leveraging regenerative agricultural systems for the sourcing of raw materials has the potential to be a game changer. As such, Kering has become a Frontier Founder under Savory’s Land to Market program to promote and support the regenerative production of raw materials and utilize Savory’s pioneering methodology, Ecological Outcome VerificationTM (EOV), in its leather and fiber supply chains that come from grazing systems, such as wool and cashmere. EOV measures the indicators of ecosystem functionality in order to ascertain the overall health of the land and grazing systems that support the production of these raw materials. The resulting science-based and empirical data provides farmers with critical information to make better decisions and realize the ecological results from regenerative grazing.

As an element of their collaboration, Kering and Savory will identify and develop a new network of farms that Kering will be able to access. As a first step to building regenerative supply within this network, Kering will focus on its key sourcing regions and work with Savory to support farmers pursuing and demonstrating positive ecological outcomes on their land. This will provide the Group with a new sustainable sourcing solution that verifies its key raw materials and provides traceability back to the farm. The resulting network of farms will offer a pathway towards more restorative and regenerative practices for other companies to follow and can be incorporated in fashion and luxury’s supply chains more broadly.

“Regenerative agriculture is a multi-benefit solution which supports Kering’s sustainability ambitions to mitigate our environmental impacts and deliver positive outcomes along our supply chain,” said Marie-Claire Daveu, Chief Sustainability Officer and Head of international institutional affairs at Kering. “We are proud to collaborate with Savory to pioneer innovative and nature-based solutions in fashion as part of our broader commitment to contribute to solving our industry’s global challenges around biodiversity and climate change.”

Kering, parent company of some of the biggest names in luxury fashion — including Gucci, Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta, Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen — has led the charge for sustainable luxury by taking a holistic view of its operations. In 2015, the company released its environmental profit and loss methodology to encourage wider adoption of natural capital accounting; since then, it has continued to demonstrate its commitment by committing to an SDG-aligned sustainability strategy, adopting science-based emissions targets, helped develop a biodiversity metric to help companies reduce their impacts, and joined the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute’s Fashion Positive PLUS initiative to help develop circular solutions that can keep its material inputs in perpetual cycles of use and reuse.

“We are delighted to welcome Kering to our growing roster of Frontier Founders across sectors,” said Savory Institute CEO Daniela Ibarra-Howell. “This is an important step forward for fashion and we commend Kering’s leaders for having the foresight to build an approach to sourcing that is rooted in regenerative outcomes. It’s a win for farmers, consumers and of course, the environment on which we all depend.”

Also this week, Fashion for Good announced its latest partnership — with BESTSELLER, an international fashion company based in Denmark with more than 20 brands in its portfolio — exemplifying their mutual commitment for industry-wide collaboration to bring game-changing circular innovation to supply chains.

Katrin Ley, Managing Director of Fashion for Good, on the new partnership: “We are delighted to join forces with BESTSELLER as they launch Fashion FWD — BESTSELLER’s new strategy which makes sustainability central to its way of doing business. The focus areas of Fashion FWD — ranging from innovative new materials to circular business models — are perfectly aligned with Fashion for Good’s innovation agenda. Together, we want to speed up the transition towards good fashion.”

As part of the partnership, BESTSELLER will engage in setting Fashion for Good’s innovation strategy — including defining focus areas, taking part in the selection of new innovators, and providing expertise and mentorship to the selected startups. BESTSELLER will also benefit from specialised scouting and screening support, as well as preferential access to market-ready innovations through Fashion for Good’s established and expanding network.

“At BESTSELLER, we want to bring sustainable fashion forward until we are climate positive, fair for all and circular by design,” said Sustainability Manager Dorte Rye Olsen. “To do this, we need sustainable innovation and industry collaboration. This is exactly what Fashion for Good represents and why we are pleased to announce our new partnership with them.”

BESTSELLER, whose apparel and accessories brands include Jack & Jones, Junarose, Jacqueline De Yong, Mamalicious, Name It, Lmtd, Noisy May, Object Collectors Item and Only — is building a strong sustainability strategy and circular fashion agenda. In 2017, the company joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s CE100 group to explore the possibilities and challenges of moving towards a circular system. BESTSELLER is also a Strategic Partner of the Global Fashion Agenda (GFA), a leadership forum working to set a common direction for industry efforts on sustainability.",United States,2018.12
276,Newsmaker: The Buzz Surrounding 2018’s Buzzword—Sustainability,"If fashion had one theme in 2018 it was sustainability. While some who are unfamiliar with the concept are confused by the term “sustainability,” a sustainable-fashion industry is able to support itself through conservative manufacturing methods that limit harm to the environment and sourcing based on reuse.

Many sustainable-fashion brands also adhere to ethical standards for the treatment of employees such as fair-wage practices and eradicating the exploitation of female workers. Sustainable efforts can also include ecologically sound, cruelty-free material sourcing, including wool, leather and silk alternatives.

With the exploding popularity of the sustainable-fashion segment, driven by greater consumer awareness of product origins, it seems sustainability is here to stay. From apparel brands opting to upcycle dead stock or choosing to manufacture with textiles made from recycled water bottles to technology that reduces difficult-to-recycle plastics into usable fibers, science and technology have played an integral role in sustainable fashion.

Pushes for sustainability weren’t only seen at the design level, but over the last 12 months apparel-trade-show organizers produced events that took sustainable fashion mainstream. With its inaugural event held at New York City’s LIM College in May, the Sustainable Fashion Forum landed in Los Angeles on Oct. 4 during the L.A. Textile show held at the California Market Center. Focused on transitioning fashion from the second-highest polluting industry to having a circular economy, the daylong event was produced by Fashiondex founder Andrea Kennedy.

The most anticipated sustainability-centric event launch was the inaugural ReMode show held Nov. 13–14 at the Los Angeles Convention Center in downtown Los Angeles. Founded by Pierre-Nicolas Hurstel, ReMode was produced by UBM as an opportunity for fashion-industry professionals to connect with peers in other segments of the apparel business to collaborate toward sustainable manufacturing.

ReMode enlisted the expertise of professionals who represented all segments of the apparel business. Under four distinct themes referred to as ReThink, ReMake, ReMarket and ReInvest, ReMode challenged the fashion industry to reconsider the methods it uses to create apparel.",United States,2018.12
279,Taiwan’s Circular Economy: A Model for Global Sustainability?,"On Dec. 31, 2017, China banned the importation of foreign waste. Until then, the United States and Europe quietly shipped a majority of their recyclables – plastic waste, mixed paper, metals, even cardboard – to China’s interior, where small local factories sorted, melted, and resold them as base materials to other companies. But no longer.

The result of China’s National Sword Policy has been a sharp and steep decline in the value and price of recyclables, leaving U.S. recycling centers reeling.

States like California, which once exported more than 60 percent of their recyclables to China, now face an expensive dual burden of adhering to strict domestic waste management laws and international recycling quality standards stricter than those of China. Many U.S. municipalities with small budgets are questioning whether the business of recycling is even worth it. Some are even considering cutting their recycling programs entirely.

With no stable domestic market for the purchase and reuse of recyclables in the U.S., the material is now being stockpiled in warehouses. But this time-tethered solution is limited by storage space and strict health-hazard policies, leading most waste collection companies to make the difficult decision to dump recyclables in landfills – a cheap fix for a troubled industry facing price volatility and fallout from their biggest buyer.

Beyond the immediate consequences, this recycling quagmire demonstrates the limits and challenges of operating within the current global economic system. Described by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation as the “take-make-dispose” model, this linear industrial process follows an A-to-B pattern, where resources are taken, products are made, and then disposed. New objects are created from virgin material and the system perpetuates, driven largely by an equation that maximizes profit and minimizes cost.

Recognizing the limits of earth’s capacity, the finite amount of natural resources, the immediate threat of climate change, and the ineluctable plateau of growth, one big question remains: Where do we go from here, and who will lead us into the future?

The answers might be found in Taiwan.

Known to the world for its high recycling rate, bubble milk tea, and the hardware behind iPhones, Taiwan is now experimenting with circular economy (循環經濟), humanity’s potential saving grace.

Often misperceived as “just recycling,” circular economy (CE) is both an idea and system focused on maximizing the effectiveness of resources and minimizing waste. From extraction to design, consumption to post-consumption, resources are used “to their fullest potential, follow their natural life cycles, and produce no waste,” says Martin Su, Taiwan Coordinator for 350.org, a global grassroots climate organization.

While multiple schools of thought exist, CE attempts to reflect natural biological processes and incorporate health, environmental and economic matters in its design. “Cradle-to-cradle,” birthchild of German chemist Michael Braungart and American architect William McDonough, is the most famous of CE philosophies. It distinguishes two categories: technical cycles, which recover and restore materials, and biological cycles, where food and bio-based materials are designed to go back into the environment after use via composting and anaerobic digestion.

To transform theory into practice, circular product design is key. “When we try to design a product, before we produce it, it should be evaluated throughout the life stage of the product to make sure that no energy or material is wasted throughout its life cycle,” explains Dasdy Lin (林佳蓓), Sustainability Consultant at Taiwan’s Plastics Industry Development Center, a government-supported plastics think tank.

Glass, which can be recycled infinitely without losing quality, is ideal for CE design. Taiwan leads as the world’s second best glass recycler (trailing Sweden), and its largest glass recycling company, Spring Pool Glass, boasts a recycling rate of 100,000 metric tons per year.

Directed by Wu Ting-an, a 2018-19 Eisenhower Innovation Fellow, Spring Pool Glass began as a family business in an industry notorious for small profit margins. Now, it is an eminent example of a successful circular business model, thanks in part to the development of recycled glass products, including art pieces and insulation blocks.

Under Taiwan’s 4-in-1 Recycling Program, Spring Pool contracts with public and private entities (both commercial enterprises and individual collectors) to obtain industrial and household glass and recycle them into new forms.

Recycled glass art sparkles in a mountain scene at the Taoyuan Airport and in the public showroom of their Green Tourism Factory, where visitors can get an inside look at their recycling process on the factory floor. Men and women expertly wield scalding hot glass orbs from furnaces onto mechanical carousels, where they are spun at extraordinary speeds to produce flawless crystal-clear pot covers and drinking glasses – products bound straight for the Japanese market.

For T.A., recycling is “just a process, not the end result.” To demonstrate the power of circularity as a problem-solving tool, Spring Pool turned to the issue of environmental waste. According to government data, 6,000 tons of waste liquid crystal display (LCD) generated by the island’s high-tech industry is discarded each year. The company recycles LCD, transforming screens of old cell phones and high-res televisions into lightweight, sound and fireproof insultation blocks for use in the construction industry.

But it doesn’t stop there. Taiwan is home to Asia’s first electronics waste (e-waste) recycling facility, E&E Recycling, one of now 11 e-waste recycling facilities on the island. Founded by the heads of Panasonic, TECO, and Hitachi, the government subsidy-supported factory collects refrigerators, air conditioners, IT equipment, and televisions from residents.

Workers in yellow hard hats and pastel green shirts then sledge hammers and operate machinery to break down the large home appliances, capturing resources like precious metals in silicon boards, while removing toxins like hydrofluorocarbons. Recovered resources are sold to contracted companies in a closed loop system. “Waste is just a misallocated resource,” says William Sui, E&E factory supervisor.

E&E’s model is representative of a “reverse cycle,” one of the four CE building blocks, where materials are collected, separated or sorted, and treated post-use. Materials are then put back into industrial production stream in an effective end-of-life sorting process, meeting the ultimate goal for circular economy: preventing waste.

The concept is also supported by the island’s leaders, including President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文). Circular economy is part of her 5+2 innovative industries initiative, a national development strategy aimed at revitalizing the Taiwanese economy while supporting environmental sustainability.

Speaking at the opening ceremony for the Circular Economy & Energy Exhibition in Taipei this September, President Tsai noted that the “time is ripe for businesses at home and abroad to invest in the country and capitalize on its economic and industrial transformation.”

Even before circular economy reached the pinnacle of the policy world, several Taiwanese groups were already involved in end-of-life sorting processes.

Tzu Chi (慈濟), a Taiwan-based Buddhist Compassion Relief Foundation, is locally known for its recycling efforts. Leagues of elderly volunteers, stationed at local neighborhood facilities, collect donated goods from residents, who opt to give their old bikes and recyclables to the group instead of dumping them in the public waste stream.

Volunteers then sort through them, placing scooter helmets here, newspapers there, and then begin the recycling process: sitting in small groups with their friends, they snip white edges from scrap music sheets, pull polyester film from old cassette tapes, break down metal from discarded toys.

Each item, stripped to its most basic components, is separated into a different stack – plastics are sorted by type (#1 - #7), with P.E.T. bottles getting extra treatment because of their high recycling value. The #1 soda and water bottles are sorted by color (clear and non-clear), separated from plastic caps and adjoining plastic rings, and then melted down into high-value polyester fibers.

Da Ai (大愛), the entrepreneurial engineering arm of Tzu Chi Foundation, then weaves these fibers into t-shirts, solar-powered visors and backpacks, shoes, and suitcases. Items on display in their Neihu showroom each feature a serialized tag, which links to an app listing the number of bottles recovered and the amount of energy spent during production. Most famous are the 100 percent recycled polyester blankets, made for disaster-relief missions to aid victims like those affected by Hurricane Harvey.

Then, there are shining examples in the private sector. Da Fon Environment Technology Co. Ltd. (大豐環保科技股份有限公司), a waste reduction and recycling company, focuses on upcycling and in their own words “turn waste into gold.” Recyclables collected from 35 site locations, including a storefront in New Taipei City, are granulated, washed, and either shipped as raw material to other companies or transformed by the R&D team into hand-held calendars, tote bags, and even urinals.

They even have their own Zero-to-Zero app, which connects people looking to get rid of their recyclables with the company for immediate pick-up. A point system linked to the number of items (and times) they recycle is used in both their storefront and app – once they reach a certain level, participants can trade-in points for household items, like bamboo toothbrushes and government-mandated garbage bags.

Miniwiz, an engineering firm founded and led by National Geographic Emerging Explorer Arthur Huang, takes waste and designs high-end products. Plastic bottle caps are transformed into colorful building blocks, leftover rice husk into stackable office dividers, plastic water bottles into architectural feats. Consumer goods, furniture, transportation: the list goes on.

For all its progress, however, practitioners and scholars still believe Taiwan’s greatest challenge to achieving circular economy is the lack of a systemized, department-wide policy and a clear definition for all stakeholders of what CE actually is. “The problem with circular economy is the infighting between KMT (Kuomintang) and DPP (Democratic Progressive Party) and the weak cooperative relationships between corporations and government,” says former Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) Minister Chang Juu-en (張祖恩), now Environmental Engineering Professor at National Cheng Kung University. It “is the largest challenge Taiwan is facing when speaking of waste management.”

Concerns from small and medium-sized business owners, who are integrated in and reliant on global export supply chains the linear model supports, don’t see the tangible benefits of making the switch to CE. “It is uneconomic for Taiwan to enforce circular economy,” explains a PLA plastics factory owner from Miaoli County. “First, the market is weak, and the volume of production is insufficient. If Taiwan enforces circular economy, it has no advantage to compete with others in price cutting-throat competition.”

A lot of confusion comes from not knowing what exactly CE is. “So far, there’s no good branding for it,” says T.A. Wu, Director of Spring Pool Glass. “We need to get better at branding the concept of circular economy, so more and more people know what it is.”

While Taiwan struggles to apply circular economy in practice, the U.S. is barely discussing it. Waste management companies, however, may be the first to visit the idea as their businesses continue to be impacted by the China ban. A call for an industry re-frame is in the air, with some waste company leaders seeing waste collection as the “first step in the supply for a manufacturing environment” instead of dumping ground for obsolete and valueless material.

At the end of day, circular economy has the potential to transform Taiwan and distinguish it as a model for Asia. For now, it is a socio-economic experiment many entrepreneurs, policy leaders, and volunteers are willing to engage in. Some see circular economy as Taiwan’s route to self-sufficiency. Others perceive it is as a solution to Taiwan’s identity crisis with resource recycling becoming the next new thing Taiwan is known for. But we’ll just have to wait and see.

This is an initiative led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which aims to bring stakeholders together to ‘rethink and redesign’ the way we use plastics, and to build momentum towards a circular economy.

Henkel is one of 250 organisations that have signed the New Plastics Economy’s Global Commitment to eliminate plastic waste and pollution at the source. The German personal care player says that the commitment ties in with its already established efforts in the area of sustainable packaging.

What is the ‘Global Commitment’?​

The New Plastics Economy Global Commitment is led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, in collaboration with UN Environment, and was officially unveiled at the Our Ocean Conference in Bali.

Signatories include many of the world’s largest packaging producers, brands, retailers and recyclers, as well as governments and NGOs. The overall aim is to create ‘a new normal’ for plastic packaging, according to its organisers.

What are its targets?​
• None Eliminate problematic or unnecessary plastic packaging and move from single-use to reuse packaging models
• None Innovate to ensure 100% of plastic packaging can be easily and safely reused, recycled, or composted by 2025
• None Circulate the plastic produced, by significantly increasing amounts of plastics reused or recycled and made into new packaging or products

“The Global Commitment follows a clear vision of a circular economy for plastic which is in line with Henkel’s approach and targets for sustainable packaging​,” says Henkel.

Indeed, the company has said that by 2025, 100% of its packaging will be recyclable, reusable or compostable. Within the same timeframe, Henkel aims to use 35% recycled plastic for its consumer goods products in Europe.

The company has made clear a commitment to working with other stakeholders and partner organisations in this area: “To drive innovation in packaging development and promote improved recycling infrastructure, Henkel is collaborating with a variety of partners – progress toward sustainable packaging will only be possible if organizations from across industries and along the value chain work together​,” the company asserts.",United States,2018.12
283,Keeping plastic in the loop and out of the ocean,"KANSAS CITY — The world’s biggest beverage companies are joining efforts to tackle a global plastic waste problem. Whether the efforts succeed may depend on a question: Will the “circular economy” be unbroken? Technology is making more single-use plastic bottles recyclable, but messaging from industry and government may be needed to motivate the consumers of the products to recycle.

Each year at least 8 million tonnes of plastic leak into the ocean, which is equivalent to dumping the contents of one garbage truck into the ocean every minute, according to the report “The New Plastics Economy.” While the ratio of weight of fish to weight of plastic in the ocean was at 5:1 in 2014, it could be 1:1 or worse by 2050. The World Economic Forum and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation prepared the report with analytical support from McKinsey & Co. Globally, about 14% of plastic packaging is collected for recycling, according to “The New Plastics Economy.”

James Robert B. Quincey, president and chief executive officer of the Coca-Cola Co., Atlanta, said he believes plastic environmental problems may be solved, especially through the handling of PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles.

“The good news about plastic is, it’s a completely solvable problem, especially PET, because PET is fully capable of being collected, recycled and turned back into bottles,” he said Sept. 6 at the Barclays Global Consumer Staples Conference in Boston.

He added, “New technology will make it easier, but new technology is not needed. What’s needed is to solve the organizational problem of collecting the bottles and then putting in the infrastructure to basically chop them up and make them virgin material again.”

The Coca-Cola Foundation and national non-profit organization Keep America Beautiful run a recycling bin grant program. This year it will distribute 4,500 recycling bins in public space locations.

Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Inc., Danone, Mars, Inc., Nestle S.A. and Unilever all have signed onto a New Plastics Economy Global Commitment. In total, nearly 300 packaging producers, brands, retailers, recyclers, governments and non-governmental organizations have signed the global commitment to eradicate plastic and pollution at the source. The commitment, led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in collaboration with U.N. Environment, was unveiled Oct. 29 in Bali.

One goal is that 100% of plastic packaging be easily and safely reused, recycled or composted by 2025.

“The New Plastics Economy Global Commitment draws a line in the sand, with businesses, governments and others around the world uniting behind a clear vision for what we need to create a circular economy for plastic,” said Dame Ellen MacArthur, founder of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. “This is just one step on what will be a challenging journey, but one which can lead to huge benefits for society, the economy and the environment. I encourage all businesses and governments to go further and embark on a race to the top in the creation of a circular economy for plastic, one in which this material never becomes waste or pollution.”

Recycled PET, also called rPET, should play a role. PepsiCo, Inc., Purchase, N.Y., this year entered into a multi-year supply agreement with Loop Industries, Inc., which makes all its PET plastic from 100% recycled material. The deal includes a marketing and communications plan to raise awareness of the importance of recycling, sustainability and the circular economy.

“This partnership represents a step-change that will empower PepsiCo in our drive toward creating a circular economy for plastics,” said Mehmood Khan, M.D., vice-chairman and chief scientific officer for PepsiCo.

Danone S.A., Paris, signed a partnership with Loop Industries in 2017. Danone has reached 14% recycled PET (rPET) in its Waters division (in all markets where regulation allows) and aims to reach 25% rPET by 2020 and 33% by 2025.

Others are more skeptical of plastic recycling solutions, which was evident in the “Break Free From Plastic” movement. More than three dozen organizations, including Greenpeace, have participated in the movement, and nearly 10,000 volunteers in 42 countries collected over 187,851 pieces of plastic waste late in 2017 and into 2018. Companies and their consumer brands were catalogued. Not surprisingly, the top brands belonged to the largest companies: Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestle S.A., Danone S.A. and Mondelez International.

“We cannot recycle our way out of this plastic pollution crisis,” a Break Free From Plastic report said. “We must recognize the responsibility of corporations and plastic producers to innovate and implement whole system redesign to make the use of plastic packaging unnecessary.”

The volume of plastic bottles being collected for recycling in the United States has increased since 1995 but so has the volume of plastic bottles being produced, according to figures from the National Association for PET Containers Resources, the trade association for the PET plastic packaging industry in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

In 2017, 5,913 million lbs of PET bottles were sold in the United States, and 29.2%, or 1,726 million lbs, were collected through recycling programs. In 2016, the recycling rate was 28.4% as 6,172 million lbs of PET bottles were sold in the United States and 1,753 million lbs were collected for recycling. In 1995, the first year recycling data were collected, the rate was 39.7%. That year 1,950 million lbs of PET bottles were sold in the U.S. market and 775 million lbs were collected through recycling programs.

The United Kingdom, wanting to increase its recycling rate, is looking into a deposit return scheme (D.R.S.). The U.K. government asked the independent Voluntary and Economic Incentives Working Group to look at regulatory and voluntary measures to reduce littering and/or improve the recycling of drinks containers. The group found about 13 billion to 14.3 billion drink containers made of plastic were in the United Kingdom in 2016. An estimated 74% of all consumer plastic drinks bottles were collected for recycling that year. The United Kingdom trailed Germany at 98%, Norway at 95% and The Netherlands at 95%.

“All have a D.R.S. (deposit return scheme) and also have some form of curbside or household recycling collections,” the report said.

A public communications campaign would be needed to make a D.R.S. work in the United Kingdom.

“It was felt that if consumers viewed a deposit on a drinks container as a tax and did not understand that the deposit could be reclaimed upon return of the container, it could be seen as a regressive measure,” the report said.

The University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainable Leadership in the United Kingdom this year introduced a roadmap to eliminate plastic packaging waste from the bottled water and soft drinks value chain by 2030. Producers need to commit to all bottled water and soft drinks packaging to be made from 100% recyclable or reusable material by 2030 and aim for at least 70% recycled material by 2025, according to the roadmap.

Producers and government need to undertake research into consumer behavior to support recycling and achieve a circular economy for bottled water and soft drinks packaging. Government needs to create a recycling system and reinvest revenue from the new policies into U.K. recycling, sorting and reprocessing capacity.

A plastic strategy in the European Union seeks to make all plastic packaging recyclable by 2030. A rules proposal, which was approved by the European Parliament in October, includes requiring member states to collect 90% of single-use plastic drinks bottles by 2025, with deposit refund schemes being an example.

Frans Timmermans, the European Commission’s first vice-president responsible for sustainable development, gave his support for a circular economy in January 2018.

“If we don’t change the way we produce and use plastics, there will be more plastics than fish in our oceans by 2050,” he said. “We must stop plastics from getting into our water, our food and even our bodies. The only long-term solution is to reduce plastic waste by recycling and reusing more. This is a challenge that citizens, industry and governments must tackle together.”

286,Recycling old phones âcould help save endangered gorillasâ,"Recycling old smartphones stashed around the house could help towards saving endangered gorillas, scientists have claimed.

Mining of special metals such as gold and coltan for use in handsets has long blighted gorilla habitats in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, jeopardising the future of the species.

It is thought that around 400 million people across the world have a neglected old phone gathering dust, which could help protect gorillas if recycled, allowing phone makers to use the old materials again rather than mining for more.

“For every 30 to 40 mobile phones that are recycled, on average, one gram of gold can be recovered,” said great ape expert and lead paper author Dr Carla Litchfield.

“Just as mobile phone sales are soaring, and gold content is increasing in some smartphones, natural sources of gold are expected to run out by 2030.”

However the report, published in the PLOS One journal by the University of South Australia and Zoos Victoria, points out there are not enough mobile phone recycling facilities in many countries, while secrecy around phone mineral composition is another issue.

Privacy concerns about scrapping an old device are also holding back people from recycling smartphones, as well as hoarding. Privacy concerns are cited as one of the reasons people hold back from recycling their old phones (Matt Crossick/PA)

“Hoarding is problematic since precious metals are not extracted and returned to the circular economy, creating the need to mine these metals in wilderness areas,” Dr Litchfield said.

“The other issue is that if people do discard their old phones, most dispose of them in their household waste, ending up in landfill, where they leach toxic metals.”

Recent estimates for the DRC suggest that critically endangered Grauer’s gorillas have fallen by between 73% and 93%, with fewer than 4,000 remaining in the wild.",United States,2018.12
287,Recycle your old mobile phone to save gorilla populations,"Are you among the 400 million people around the world who have relegated an old mobile phone to the top drawer in the past year?

Do you realise your reluctance to recycle that discarded phone could be linked to the dramatic decline of gorilla populations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo?

The link between hoarding disused mobile phones and the decimation of Grauer gorilla habitats is explored in a paper published today in , authored by University of South Australia researchers and Zoos Victoria.

The two organisations evaluated the first six years of the ongoing 'They're Calling On You"" mobile phone recycling program run by Zoos Victoria, as part of a national campaign operating in Australian zoos.

As part of the program, zoo visitors and the broader Victorian community were educated about the value of recycling discarded phones to extract special metals used in their construction -- the same metals which are being mined in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), not only destroying gorilla habitats but also funding wars and human rights abuses.

UniSA Conservation Psychologist and Great Ape expert Dr Carla Litchfield, the paper's lead author, says if 'conflict' elements -- including gold and coltan -- can be recovered from old mobile phones, there is less incentive to mine gorilla habitats for the same minerals.

""For every 30-40 mobile phones that are recycled, on average, one gram of gold can be recovered,"" Dr Litchfield says. ""Just as mobile phone sales are soaring, and gold content is increasing in some smartphones, natural sources of gold are expected to run out by 2030.""

The authors point out the barriers to recycling used phones, including lack of e-waste recycling points in many countries, secrecy around the phones' mineral composition, privacy concerns around accessing old data, and just plain hoarding.

In Germany, by 2035 it is predicted that more than 8000 tonnes of precious metals will lie in unrecycled mobile and smartphones, and in China, by 2025 an estimated nine tonnes of gold, 15 tonnes of silver and 3100 tonnes of copper will also be out of the supply loop in 0.35 billion unrecycled phones.

""Hoarding is problematic since precious metals are not extracted and returned to the circular economy, creating the need to mine these metals in wilderness areas.

""The other issue is that if people do discard their old phones, most dispose of them in their household waste, ending up in landfill, where they leach toxic metals.""

Recent population estimates of Grauer gorillas in the DRC show a dramatic 73-93 per cent decline, with less than 4000 remaining in the wild and the species now listed as Critically Endangered.

Distinguished primatologist Dr Jane Goodall launched the national mobile recycling campaign at Melbourne Zoo in 2009 to educate visitors about the link between mining in the DRC, the destruction of gorilla habitats, and the importance of mobile phone recycling.

By 2014, zoo visitors in Victoria had donated more than 115,000 old mobile phones for recycling as a result of the social marketing initiative.

""This number may seem a drop in the ocean -- representing just 0.01 per cent of the one billion retired phones out there -- but when you look at the result in the context of a state of six million people, it is very impressive,"" says Dr Litchfield.

""Hopefully this campaign can be rolled out globally and then we could really make a difference.""",United States,2018.12
294,Food Waste Has Manufacturers Engaging The Circular Economy,"As manufacturers increasingly look for ways to bring sustainability to their operations, more are turning to concepts of the so-called “circular economy.” They recycle and “upcycle” everything they can, both benefiting the bottom line and helping preserve the planet.

There’s nowhere the circular economy may be hotter than the packaged-food industry, where CPG titans and startups alike, as well as foodservice chains and providers of plastic packaging, are rapidly intensifying their efforts.

The highest-profile aspects of this are the growing clamor against the use of plastic straws, lids, cups and other disposable forms of packaging because of how they contribute to the deluge of plastic waste that is fouling global oceans as well as filling landfills.

Most on point so far: A new TV commercial by SodaStream, the maker of countertop carbonation machines, which mocks Coca-Cola’s classic 1971 commercial, “Hilltop.” The iconic Coke ad, of course, featured hundreds of young people standing on a hilltop in Italy with Cokes in their hands and singing about global harmony. But now SodaStream depicts another diverse group of singers, each with a plastic bottle of water in their hands, singing about saving the world in a new song – while standing on an iceberg-sized heap of discarded plastic bottles.

At the same time, much of activity pointing toward a circular economy is taking place in the food business, where the industry has accepted the notion that about 40 percent of food in the United States ends up being wasted. It’s a figure hatched in 2012 by an NGO, the Environmental Resources Defense Council, based on U.S. government figures, and its very egregiousness has helped engage many companies in efforts to try to reduce it.

“In many ways, food waste is inefficiency masquerading as resources,” says Elizabeth Balkan, food waste director for NRDC. “Pinpointing the problem of food waste highlighted the fact that even sophisticated companies have inefficiencies in their supply chains and opportunities to improve entire operations that not only shrink the amount of food waste being generated but also save businesses money.”

In fact, about two dozen CPG manufacturers and food retailers are working with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as U.S. Food and Waste 2030 Champions, setting a target to cut food waste in half by 2030. They include major producers Campbell Soup, Conagra, General Mills, Kellogg, PepsiCo and Unilever, and many of the most significant retailers, such as Walmart, Kroger, Wegman’s and Ahold Delhaize USA.

Tyson Foods is one processing pioneer in this regard. It has introduced Yappah, a new brand of “chicken crisps” snacks that are made from upcycled trimmings of chicken breasts, tapioca flour, vegetable purees “rescued” from juicing, and malted barley that is a byproduct of beer brewing. The first product out of the chute for Tyson’s intrapreneurial Innovation Lab, Yappah sprinted from concept to finished product on the shelf in only six months.

“It’s very important because we believe that, hopefully through this launch, we can help create awareness with action to fight food waste,” says Rizal Hamdallah, head of Innovation Lab. “It’s unbelievable to see how many companies talk about it but don’t act on it. What’s important for us as a leader is to show that we can start doing something about it.”

An increasing number of startup manufacturers are using food-waste reduction as a primary platform. Barnanas is one of the most prominent such startups. Co-Founder Caue Suplicy and his partners have built a $15-million-plus startup in just six years, selling banana “bites” in several varieties. Because Barnanas’ ideal raw material was bananas that were a bit ripe, there was a vast supply of the fruit in Central and South America that would be available in the form of waste bananas.

“We’ve upcycled more than 13 million kilos of bananas so far and we’ve barely even scratched the surface of global banana waste,” Co-Founder and Chief Marketing Officer Nik Ingersoll says. “About 20 percent of all bananas produced go to waste. It’s astronomical how many there are, and we continue to use them every day.”

299,EUR 1bn already allocated to the development of smart and sustainable cities in Belgium thanks to EIB-Belfius partnership,"Since the partnership between the European Investment Bank (EIB) and Belfius to promote the development of “Smart Cities” in Belgium was announced, over EUR 1bn in investment in no less than 121 projects has already been financed on favourable terms by the two institutions. Buoyed by this success, Belfius and the EIB have signed a new agreement to provide an additional EUR 400m with a view to supporting even more projects helping to develop smart cities, the circular economy and the fight against global warming.

This new programme – Smart Cities, Climate Action & Circular Economy II – aims to help local authorities, inter-municipal groupings and non-commercial organisations in the social and education sectors in Belgium to implement their smart and sustainable projects by granting finance on favourable terms. The scope of the programme covers not only energy, mobility and urban development, but also water (distribution networks, sewers, drainage, treatment), waste (selective collection, sorting, biological treatment and sludge treatment, energy production) and e-government (particularly open data). In addition to an integrated, innovative and sustainable approach, the circular economy and climate action are key focal points of project appraisal and evaluation.

More than 2 million people have already benefited from EUR 1bn

121 projects representing an investment of more than EUR 1bn have already been financed thanks to the partnership between Belfius and the EIB. These projects, which have an impact on the daily lives of more than two million people across the country, come from local authorities, CPAS (Public Social Action Centres), inter-municipal groupings, provincial institutions, and non-commercial, social and education sector organisations.

Already completed or in progress, they range from the regeneration of city centres and the transformation of the hearts of villages to the renovation of schools and cultural and sports centres, the construction of rest and care homes, and the centralisation of administrative and emergency services in new smart and sustainable buildings. In addition, they include the creation of cycle and pedestrian paths and the construction of a wind farm alongside a motorway, as well as the replacement of an ageing fleet of vehicles by cleaner models. Most of the projects financed combine energy efficiency and renewable energy measures with sustainable mobility and urban development. The circular economy is also a central aspect of many projects.

Climate and the environment targeted by local authorities

Local authorities can play a major role in combating global warming and developing the circular economy by setting an example and thereby encouraging companies, individuals and other organisations to implement environmentally-friendly initiatives of their own. A number of Belgian cities and municipalities have already signed the Covenant of Mayors, undertaking to promote climate protection and voluntarily cut CO emissions in their area. With this new joint programme – Smart Cities, Climate Action & Circular Economy II – Belfius and the EIB intend to continue to provide the best support and assistance for these efforts.

EIB Director General Jean-Christophe Laloux said: “By 2050, more than 75% of the global population with be concentrated in cities. This is why transforming urban areas to make them smarter and more sustainable is among the EIB’s key objectives. Together with Belfius, our long-standing partner for the Smart Cities programme in Belgium, we are confident that by helping local authorities to implement their projects according to their needs, goals and size, the EU bank will have a quick and direct impact on residents’ quality of life, the environment and climate. On the occasion of the COP 24, it is also the very essence of the European project to be at the heart of cities and villages to serve people and local development.”

Dirk Gyselinck, member of the management board at Belfius, said: “Given the numerous challenges to be overcome and climate change in particular, governments, social sector players and businesses have no choice but to work together to think about and design the world of tomorrow. Our Smart Belgium strategy aims to make Belfius the driving force behind this initiative, providing tangible, local support and applying our financing and expertise to offer a smart and sustainable response to the needs of current and future generations. We are therefore particularly pleased to sign this new agreement – which is fully in line with this strategy – with the EIB today.”",United States,2018.12
304,SABIC looks to crack waste plastic •,"Chemical manufacturer SABIC is planning a demonstration plant in the Netherlands to test the use of low quality, contaminated mixed plastic waste as a feedstock for the company’s crackers in Europe.

The feedstock, known as pyrolysis oil, is created by converting the plastic waste that would otherwise go to energy recovery or landfill. The feedstock will be refined and upgraded at the new plant. The facility is due to be built at the group’s Geleen manufacturing site, according to Abdulrahman Al-Fageeh, SABIC’s executive vice president for petrochemicals.

‘We are supporting greatly the mechanical recycling of plastics but we believe that the long term sustainable circular economy will lie in chemical recycling,’ said Al-Fageeh. ‘We are in the process to make sure we have the right technology and of course you have to depend on the value chain of the business.’

Such units could be an integral part in the circular economy model as it helps to create new feedstock supply while at the same time protecting the environment, he added. ‘We are really one of the pioneers for supporting and encouraging for the change of the model from a linear to a circular economy,’ Al-Fageeh said.

He argued this shift towards circularity would require the engagement and support of the value chain, consumers and governments. ‘This starts from the end user of the products, the schools… Everybody needs to be convinced that this is the right thing to do. It may also require some intervention from the governments to make sure that there is some regulation for waste and how to deal and collect with the waste,’ he said.

‘The moment we demonstrate that waste plastic is a really good sustainable feedstock for the crackers, I’m sure it will go to the whole world.’

305,"Total Corbion PLA starts-up 75,000 tons per year bioplastics plant","Total Corbion PLA, a 50/50 joint venture between Total and Corbion, announces the start-up of its 75,000 tons per year PLA (Poly Lactic Acid) bioplastics plant in Rayong, Thailand. The plant has successfully produced Luminy® PLA resins. This bioplastic provides a valuable contribution towards the circular economy being biobased and biodegradable and offering multiple environmentally-friendly waste solutions.

The new facility will produce a broad range of Luminy® PLA resins from renewable, non-GMO sugarcane sourced locally in Thailand: from standard PLA to innovative, high heat PLA and PDLA with unique properties. The products will meet customers’ needs in a wide range of markets notably packaging, consumer goods, 3D printing, fibers and automotive and are specifically optimized for extrusion, thermoforming, injection molding and fiber spinning processes.

At the end of their useful life, PLA products can be mechanically or chemically recycled, or in some cases composted and returned to the soil as fertilizer.

Total Corbion PLA will leverage on the integration with its Lactide plant, the monomer required for the production of PLA, that has simultaneously been expanded to 100,000 tons per year production capacity. Furthermore, the 1,000 tons per year PLA pilot plant, which has been operational since the end of 2017, is located on the same site and will be used for product development.

The start-up marks a major milestone for both the joint venture and the bioplastics market. With this additional 75,000 tons per year facility, the global production of PLA bioplastics will increase by almost 50%, to 240,000 tons per year. PLA is a fast-growing polymer market with an estimated annual growth rate of 10% to 15%.

“The start-up of this state-of-the-art plant establishes Total Corbion PLA as a world-scale PLA bioplastic producer, ideally located to serve growing markets from Asia Pacific to Europe and the Americas” says Stephane Dion, CEO of the company. “The subsequent increase in global PLA capacity will enable manufacturers and brand owners to move into the circular economy and produce biobased products with lower carbon footprints and multiple end of life options.”

“I’m very pleased that the joint venture has started-up the second-largest PLA bioplastics plant in the world. This achievement is fully in line with our strategy, to expand in petrochemicals and, at the same time, innovate in low-carbon solutions. Bioplastics are a great complement to our more traditional petrochemicals products to meet the rising demand for polymers while contributing towards reducing end-of-life concerns” says Bernard Pinatel, President Refining & Chemicals at Total.

Corbion, that supplies the lactic acid to this fully integrated plant, is happy with the news: “The successful start-up of this state-of-the-art PLA plant is the result of impressive team work by many. This is good news for consumers and producers who want to make a conscious choice to improve their carbon footprint and make their contribution to a circular economy. A world of innovation and business opportunities has opened up while contributing to a better world” says Tjerk de Ruiter, CEO at Corbion.",United States,2018.12
309,Petcore Europe & PRE launch ‘Design for Recycling Guidelines’ for PET trays,"The initiative is on the back of The European PET Bottle Platform (EPBP)’s campaign​, which supports companies with their bottle design and innovation developments without disrupting the existing PET recycling industry.

More needs to be done

In the EU market, PET-based trays contain on average around 55% of recycled plastics but this is just the first step already achieved towards circularity.

“There is a growing trend in the collection of PET trays for specific recycling activities. But, more work must be done. Besides separate collection and proper sorting of trays and other PET sheet-based products, design for recycling is a major tool to boost their circularity​,” said Sebastian Lemp, communications executive, Petcore Europe.​

The guidelines​ have been developed by the PET Thermoforms Working Group, under Petcore Europe, and companies can contact the group for advice on how to improve the designs for recycling of their packaging.

Trays made out of PET sheet are ideal for applications such as fresh food and dairy (fresh and sliced meats, cheese, fresh pasta), providing great performances in transparency and improving the shelf life of products.

With these guidelines the PET industry wants to show that properly designed packaging, separate collection, good sorting and recycling of PET trays are the way towards circularity.

They reflect the current status-of-the art of technology; Petcore Europe will welcome any suggestion and will evaluate any new incoming technology in order to improve the document.

Every interested part can contact Petcore Europe to join this specific Working Group to cooperate towards an improved sustainability of PET-based trays.

Petcore already launched a Working Group for Opaque and Difficult to Recycle (ODR) products in February last year, after the issue of heavily colored or opaque PET, which is in fast growing demand in new applications for milk bottles, detergents and family care products. Currently recyclers process mainly transparent or light colored PET.

The Working Group chairmen: Gian de Belder, circular economy & packaging sustainability, Procter & Gamble, and Herbert Snell, sales, MultiPet, will organize three meetings a year to discuss the issue as well as a public workshop.

The chairmen of the Working Group on Recycling PET Thermoforms is Wim Hoenderdaal Business Development Manager PET Recycling at Indorama Ventures Europe and Paolo Glerean, sales director, PET sheet dept. Aliplast and their last meeting was in May this year.

The EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes and Processing Aids (CEP) recently announced it carried out a safety assessment of ‘RecyPET Hungária​’, based on RecyPET Hungária technology, used to recycle post‐consumer PET into food contact materials, which it found to be unreliable. (EFSA Journal, November 30, 2018).

In the report it said: ‘The recycled plastic is intended for manufacture of bottles for soft drinks or water. The applicant provided a challenge test, but the flakes contaminated with the surrogates and the pellets obtained after extrusion and crystallisation were extracted with n​‐hexane without showing sufficient recovery. The Panel considered the extraction as unreliable and could therefore not conclude on the efficiency of the decontamination process’.

It claimed the flow charts provided by the applicant did not enable a clear identification of the steps relevant for the decontamination efficiency, and no sufficiently clear overview of the operational parameters of the steps of the process and the challenge test was provided.

‘Without this information, a proper safety evaluation could not be performed. The Panel concluded that the process RecyPET Hungária is not sufficiently characterised and the applicant has not demonstrated in an adequately performed challenge test or by other appropriate evidence that the recycling process RecyPET Hungária is able to reduce contamination of the PET input to a concentration that does not pose a risk to human health’.",United States,2018.12
311,2050: a new deadline for a zero-carbon Europe,"The EU has adopted a long-term strategy for achieving carbon neutrality in three decades or so.

The strategy is aimed at a wide range of stakeholders. It emphasizes technical solutions, citizen engagement and coordination of policies across sectors during the transition. It is also expected to enhance Europe’s competitiveness on the global markets.

However, still absent is a clear list of activities and targets, although the aim of the present document is different. The idea, the EU says, is to “create a vision and sense of direction” for effective climate solutions combined with sustainable economic growth. The document highlights the need for energy efficiency, renewables, mobility, a circular economy, infrastructure development and bio-economy as key focus areas.

“We cannot safely live on a planet with the climate that is out of control. But that does not mean that to reduce emissions, we should sacrifice the livelihoods of Europeans,” Maroš Šefčovič, the vice-president responsible for the Energy Union, commented on the document. “

Over the last years, we have shown how to reduce emissions, while creating prosperity, high-quality local jobs, and improving people’s quality of life. Europe will inevitably continue to transform,” he added. “Our strategy now shows that by 2050, it is realistic to make Europe both climate neutral and prosperous, while leaving no European and no region behind.”

While few EU members are succeeding at meeting their climate targets, there are ways that this ambitious vision could be realized. For example, a recent Mission Possible report suggests that complete decarbonization by 2050 in the developed world is both economically and technically possible. A new roadmap by a global group of scientists also proposes a similarly optimistic scenario.",United States,2018.12
314,Creating a voice,"The Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA) met for its first AGM and symposium at the Corinthia Hotel, London, UK, on Friday, 23 November 2018. With leading CEOs, sustainability, logistics, strategists and co-processing managers, as well as cement and concrete associations in attendance, delegates were informed of an agreed work programme for the GCCA going forward. In addition, the GCCA explained how it will create a voice for the cement and concrete industry, promoting cement as 'the sustainable building material of choice'.

As the first speaker, Albert Manifold, President of GCCA and CEO of CRH, explained that while the industry was well represented at the national and regional level, this is the first time that a global advocacy body has been the voice for the industry in facing the challenges of sustainability, climate change, population growth and innovation. Although the GCCA is led by CEOs and global industry leaders, it requires input and support at local and regional levels.

The GCCA's membership has been growing rapidly since its creation. At present, the GCCA has a membership representing approximately 35 per cent of the global cement capacity (32 member companies and nine affiliates). The association aims to reach the 50 per cent mark as soon as possible, by which time it believes it will have a solid mandate to be the industry's voice.

The GCCA's core aim is to make cement the building material of choice and to achieve this, the association is putting the necessary guidance in place for its members to improve their sustainability standards. ""For the GCCA to make concrete the sustainable building product of choice, it must highlight its sustainable qualities of durability, productivity, low noise, fire resistance, etc,"" said Mr Manifold.

He added that five goals to sustainability have been created and form the basis of the association's work programme. The GCCA will work with best practices to safeguard health and safety in both the cement and construction industries. It will also contribute to the debate and discussion of these sustainable goals, particularly in terms of construction and innovation, which will be at the core of the association's activities. Furthermore, it will embrace the principles of the circular economy across the full value chain.

To the next level

Benjamin Sporton, GCCA CEO, thanked the steering committees for developing the work programme over the last 12 months and Frank Rossini for being GCCA’s acting CEO before Mr Sporton's appointment. Commenting that concrete has a future and is essential to the modern world, Mr Sporton stated the GCCA wants to take that message to the next level – to the UN, development banks and international inter-governmental organisations.

Citing the UN forecast that 1.1bn people will move from rural areas to cities in the next 15 years, Mr Sporton said that concrete will be fundamental in helping to provide shelter, water and food for the growing urban population. The global floor space covered by concrete is expanding at the speed of a new Japan every year, for the next 40 years, and much of that will be in emerging economies. By 2050 more than two-thirds of the population will live in cities and concrete will play a critical role.

Mr Sporton also announced that the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) will be taken over by the GCCA on 1 January 2019 and will be further developed to include concrete. The GCCA plans to increase development of innovation in working with organisations such as ECRA and improving best practice by using examples in one part of the world and sharing them with other regions. Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) will be an additional focal point as an industry-wide challenge.

Altogether, the GCCA's programme will have six work streams:

1. health and safety in the cement and concrete industries

2. future construction and the role of concrete

3. sustainable value of concrete

4. concrete guidelines

5. cement innovation

6. cement best practices and recording.

GCCA Cement Director, Claude Lorea, spoke about how the association wanted to be a leader in sustainability. She clarified the sustainability charter, which defines the key pillars of the sustainability spectrum for cement and concrete. The charter includes guidance in terms of:
• health and safety
• climate change and energy
• social responsibility
• environment and nature
• circular economy.

Full members will be data monitored and expected to report on their performance and targets in these areas. Members will also be able to apply for extended compliance.

Meanwhile, as part of the work programme, health and safety is seen as a key best practice priority. The GCCA will extend this area to concrete and share knowledge among its members by creating networks and holding annual forums. It will also target hot countries where it will foster more local collaboration, ensuring best practice.

As part of its climate change and energy reduction drive, GCCA also plans a smooth transition for the CSI’s Getting the Numbers Right (GNR) database and the team are currently working on the 2017 round of data collection.

In addition, the association aims to establish best practice and reporting guidelines for health and safety, CO reporting, co-processing and water use.

As part of the industry's drive to lower CO emissions, GCCA will also provide feedback on cement innovation, alternative binders for low-clinker cements, co-processing, recarbonisation, and CCU and CCS initiatives.

Dr Andrew Minson, GCCA concrete and sustainable construction director and the MPA's executive director, underlined that it was important for concrete to meet the demands of the fast-evolving construction market. Once the evidence base has been gathered from members, the GCCA will be able to write a better story for cement and communicate that concrete is sustainable, innovative and dynamic. It is felt that the word 'resilience' should be added to that as it is a word increasingly used by design teams in construction. Furthermore, the association needs to further explain the benefits offered over the entire product lifecycle. Dr Munson also said cement has to get its own house in order by GNR.

Paul Adeleke, GCCA communications and policy director, added that once the numbers were available, cement has to make a compelling narrative: ""We have built the world and can shape it going forwards"".

To help bring the message across, the GCCA's website will be improved in the 1Q19 and the social media messages are already being issued. The GCCA wants to create a leadership position for the sector. ""It is not just a requirement but an obligation,"" said Mr Adeleke, ""because there is a genuine deficit of trust in organisations and with societies and industries, but by showing that level of openness, innovation and humility we can fill that gap.""

Benjamin Sporton returned to the lectern to explain how does the GCCA deliver all this? The association will need good governance, leveraging the broad experience base of its members. Therefore, the GCCA will invite members to take part in the work programmes. In addition, it will create partnerships and stakeholder panels made up of CEOs as well as regional and national associations, proactively sharing ideas and successes. It also wants to establish informal networks of dialogue. ""The GCCA aims to be a thought leader,"" said Mr Sporton.",United States,2018.12
316,New Case Study Report on Messaging the Circular Economy,"As more companies commit to innovative circular economy and sustainability strategies and investments, there is an increased need to learn the best practices for successfully communicating these decisions externally. The Chamber Foundation recently published a case study and insights publication, Messaging the Circular Economy, which showcases (1) tactics companies are taking to educate customers on their circular products, ambitions, or service offerings, and the opportunity the circular economy represents in the United States; (2) perspective pieces from nonprofit organizations, communications and advisory firms, academia, and trade associations on how to communicate to external stakeholders about circularity; and (3) research on what messages resonate with which audiences.

The case study publication covers approaches from a wide range of businesses, from internationally headquartered to U.S.-headquartered, publicly traded to privately held, business-facing to consumer-facing, and across industries, from consumer electronics to apparel.

Communicating business relevance, shared responsibility, and corporate priorities about extending the useful life of products and services involves many tactics, exemplified and explained in the publication. Within the report, you'll see details of video campaigns, graphics, white papers, and playbooks, as well as the value in transparency regarding lessons learned and approach rationale.

The publication fills the gap in the literature on how companies can most effectively communicate about their circular ambitions, products, and service offerings. Businesses that want to understand how best to communicate such priorities can reference the examples and research insights featured in the report.

We hope you enjoy it! Access the ""Messaging the Circular Economy"" publication here. If you have any questions or are interested in submitting a case study for a future Chamber Foundation publication, please contact Stephanie Potter or Scott Breen.",United States,2018.12
319,Building a circular economy movement in India and beyond,"In June, the Indian state of Maharashtra, home to 110 million people and encompassing Mumbai, enacted a ban on single-use plastics, including bags and bottles. A dramatic step, the ban forced a rethink for recent Penn graduates Peter Wang Hjemdahl and Svanika Balasubramanian. Their social enterprise, rePurpose, which won them a Penn President’s Engagement Prize earlier this year, had been designed as a digital marketplace that empowers waste workers, known as kabadiwalas, who sort recyclables and sell them for a profit.

Given such abrupt changes, which were compounded by other recent regulatory shocks to the market, many kabadiwalas were forced to rethink their future in this sector.

Along with co-founder Aditya Siroya, who is taking a year off from his studies at Penn to work on rePurpose, Hjemdahl and Balasubramanian saw “an opportunity” in the policy change.

“We didn’t see the legal change as an obstacle in any way,” Hjemdahl says. “What it did was create a massive wave of consumer and corporate awareness about the waste issue in India.”

Pivoting slightly from their original plans, the rePurpose team reaffirmed their original commitment to supporting waste workers and effecting environmental change. Guided by this core mission, the reimagined enterprise aims to create a global movement of conscious consumers who take responsibility for their plastic footprint and mobilize support for innovative waste worker organizations through the rePurpose platform.

The rePurpose team’s reshaped effort has two pillars: reBalance, a plastic waste reduction and offset platform through which individual consumers make a payment to “balance out” their plastics footprint—a sum that is matched by like-minded sustainable businesses and then funneled into supporting waste worker organizations; and rePurpose Labs, a middle-school sustainability education curriculum aimed at endowing schoolchildren across India with the right knowledge, attitudes, and skills to become social and environmental changemakers.

“In everything we do, the most important thing for us is to maintain a dedication to our beneficiaries,” Hjemdahl says. “For us, that means a longer term vision of creating an inclusive circular economy where waste workers are supported, and individual consumers as well as corporations can engage in a meaningful way.”

That dedication began in 2015, when Hjemdahl, together with fellow Wharton students Robert Dowling, Holly Li, and Jake Fischer, began formulating the idea behind rePurpose. It earned them a position as regional finalists for the Hult Prize, a social entrepreneurship competition that prompts students to generate start-up ideas that sustainably address the world’s most pressing problems.

Hjemdahl was still developing the concept when he connected with Balasubramanian and Siroya last fall. The three students hit it off, each interested in social entrepreneurship and possessing complementary skills. Together they worked to launch rePurpose, and successfully applied for the President’s Engagement Prize.

The Engagement Prizes, offered annually, recognize seniors who develop projects that aim to make a positive and lasting difference locally, nationally, or globally. Awarded by Penn President Amy Gutmann and supported by Judith Bollinger and William G. Bollinger, in honor of Ed Resovsky; Trustee Lee Spelman Doty and George E. Doty, Jr.; and Emeritus Trustee James S. Riepe and Gail Petty Riepe, the prizes provide $100,000 to implement the project, and a $50,000 living stipend for each team member.

Hjemdahl, Balasubramanian, and Siroya started full-time work on rePurpose this summer, joined by intern Aryan Shah, a high school senior at the Dhirubhai Ambani International School. Diving in, they moved to Mumbai and immediately embarked on what they describe as “a crash course in waste management,” checking back in with partners and stakeholders to determine how to move forward with their plans.

“In those first three weeks we had about 100 conversations and interviews across the spectrum,” says Siroya. “We saw that quite a few kabadiwalas were reluctant to remain in their positions because of the legislative changes, but we also discovered some really effective models of waste-worker cooperatives.” Such platforms organize informal waste scavengers working in hazardous landfills, and offer them a formal network and safe and stable livelihoods. “These are inclusive organizations, but they are still underfunded,” Hjemdahl says.

Taking a broader view, the rePurpose team recognized that the issue of plastic waste had garnered a global audience, with photos of ocean plastics circulating on social media, and plastic straw bans taking hold across the globe.

To harness this building momentum, they created reBalance, a service that enables environmentally conscious consumers to educate themselves on ways to reduce their consumption of plastic waste, and then offset the remainder with a payment to waste worker organizations, which recycle the corresponding amount of plastic waste ethically and efficiently.

The team is initially working with two waste worker cooperatives, Stree Mukti Sanghatana in Mumbai, and SWaCH in Pune, to roll out reBalance. They’re also in talks with local sustainable brands and environmentally focused foundations to match individual donations to amplify their impact. The company’s goal is to have 10 of these “coBalancers” on board by next summer. They also have plans to later expand the program to other developing countries with similar waste management models, such as the Philippines and Brazil.

The support will enable cooperatives to not only integrate more waste pickers and sort more plastics, the team notes, but will also allow them to make capacity-increasing capital investments, such as installing solar panels to combat electricity shortages in the facilities, or building sturdy sheds to protect collected materials from monsoon rains.

“It takes around 50,000 rupees to build a shed, that’s about $700,” says Balasubramanian. “That’s the action of just 30 to 40 consumers reBalancing their plastic waste.”

Adds Siroya, “That frees up capital for these organizations to enact a whole range of improvements, from building capacity to further improving the lives of the members.”

Partnerships are helping rePurpose hit the ground running. In addition to connections with the waste worker organizations, they’ve also worked closely with Sudhir Naik and Chandrakant Tambe of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai; Kedar Sohoni of the Green Communities Fund to access buildings generating dry waste; Rahul Nainani of RaddiConnect to reach an established network of kabadiwalas; and the Acorn Foundation’s Vinod Shetty to help manage relationships in Dharavi, Mumbai’s largest recycling hub.

Hjemdahl, Balasubramanian, and Siroya are using their skill sets, cultivated in part at Penn, in marketing and systems thinking, to gain the attention of consumers and investors and to assist waste workers in meeting their needs. But to take another step in making the impact on the environment even more sustainable, they created rePurpose Labs, to reach the next generation of environmental stewards and innovators.

“In Hindi, there’s an overused saying that describes the general attitude of the public, ‘Chalta hai,’ which translates to ‘It’s fine, let it be,’” says Siroya. “There can be a feeling of apathy to social problems. We’re trying to show students that they can use their skills to solve problems and not just accept them.”

This fall, the rePurpose team has been piloting a series of workshops offered to middle school students across Mumbai. So far, they’ve reached roughly 200 students in five schools, serving both privileged and underserved students. Each workshop is composed of two segments: an interactive seminar to teach students about building a circular economy, and a hands-on session where they use “Makers’ Boxes” to transform recycled materials into creative products that can be deployed in their own communities to solve local problems.

“It’s been amazing,” Siroya says. “All the students have been really engaged, and seeing the light bulb go off for them, realizing, ‘I can do something to make my home or community better,’ it’s a really visible thing you can see and feel. It’s been great fun for us as well.”

To reach many more students, they are working on a partnership with the Agastya International Foundation, an education nonprofit that works across India to foster hands-on learning. The relationship could enable rePurpose Labs to reach rural and urban students across the country.

Building on the momentum of the Engagement Prize, the team has gleaned attention from not only corporate partners, but additional mentors as well. A visit back to the U.S. in October allowed them to nurture these connections and seek guidance and ideas to bring back to their operations in Mumbai. In addition to their PEP award mentor, Robert Jensen, now at Yale University, they’ve sought advice and mentorship from a host of Penn professors, including Wharton’s Peter Fader, Jagmohan Raju, Katherine Klein, and Kartik Hosanagar, as well as Kevin Thurm of the Clinton Foundation, and Gaurav Gupta of global firm Dalberg Advisors.

They are also receiving legal and business support thanks to being accepted in the 2018-2019 Ballard Spahr BASE Program, a one-year pro bono program for startups in the Philly area. They received pro bono legal assistance prior to that from Dechert LLP, who helped them create and structure their American entity.

Not all of the learning that has taken place has directly involved their business, however. It’s been a journey of personal growth as well, living in the crowded, complicated city of Mumbai.

Whether squeezed on a jam-packed train, learning from waste workers at a landfill, or meeting with corporate leaders in the city’s soaring skyscrapers, the experience has inspired a shift in perspective.

“Every day we see something surprising, hear something surprising,” says Hjemdahl.

The team is also acutely aware that, despite their education and their skills, they have much to learn.

“We’ll never know as much about the waste recycling industry as a kabadiwala who has been doing this for 20, 30, or 40 years,” says Siroya. “They are the experts. What we’re trying to do is mobilize the resources they need to do their jobs better.”

For Balasubramanian, rePurpose represents an unparalleled chance to apply the business acumen she’s developed during her time at Penn to create an impact in the country where she was born.

“It’s incredibly challenging to mobilize people from so many different walks of life who wouldn’t have otherwise crossed paths, but we’re committed to building this movement because we believe in its potential,” she says. “We’re extremely grateful to have this kind of opportunity to use our talents and skill sets in doing something that we care so much about.”

321,Total and Corbion start up joint bioplastics plant in Thailand,"Total Corbion PLA, a 50/50 joint venture between Total S.A. (Paris, France; www.total.com) and Corbion (Amsterdam, the Netherlands; www.corbion.com), announced the startup of its 75,000 metric tons per year (m.t./yr) PLA (Poly-Lactic Acid) bioplastics plant in Rayong, Thailand. The plant has successfully produced Luminy PLA resins. This bioplastic provides a valuable contribution towards the circular economy, as it offers multiple environmentally-friendly waste solutions and produces renewable and biodegradable materials.

The new facility will produce a broad range of Luminy PLA resins from renewable, non-GMO sugarcane sourced locally in Thailand: from standard PLA to innovative, high heat PLA and PDLA with unique properties. The products will meet customers’ needs in a wide range of markets notably packaging, consumer goods, 3D printing, fibers and automotive and are specifically optimized for extrusion, thermoforming, injection molding and fiber spinning processes.

At the end of their useful life, PLA products can be mechanically or chemically recycled, or in some cases composted and returned to the soil as fertilizer.

Total Corbion PLA will leverage on the integration with its lactide plant, the monomer required for the production of PLA, that has simultaneously been expanded to 100,000 m.t./yr production capacity. Furthermore, the 1,000-m.t./yr PLA pilot plant, which has been operational since the end of 2017, is located on the same site and will be used for product development.

The start-up marks a major milestone for both the joint venture and the bioplastics market. With this additional 75,000-m.t./yr facility, the global production of PLA bioplastics will increase by almost 50% to 240,000 m.t./yr. PLA is a fast-growing polymer market with an estimated annual growth rate of 10% to 15%.

“The start-up of this state-of-the-art plant establishes Total Corbion PLA as a world-scale PLA bioplastic producer, ideally located to serve growing markets from Asia Pacific to Europe and the Americas” says Stephane Dion, CEO of the company. “The subsequent increase in global PLA capacity will enable manufacturers and brand owners to move into the circular economy and produce biobased products with lower carbon footprints and multiple end of life options.”

“I’m very pleased that the joint venture has started-up the second-largest PLA bioplastics plant in the world. This achievement is fully in line with our strategy, to expand in petrochemicals and, at the same time, innovate in low-carbon solutions. Bioplastics are a great complement to our more traditional petrochemicals products to meet the rising demand for polymers while contributing towards reducing end-of-life concerns”, says Bernard Pinatel, President Refining & Chemicals at Total.

Corbion, that supplies the lactic acid to this fully integrated plant, is happy with the news: “The successful start-up of this state-of-the-art PLA plant is the result of impressive team work by many. This is good news for consumers and producers who want to make a conscious choice to improve their carbon footprint and make their contribution to a circular economy.

327,Is insect protein on the march? AgriProtein acquires Belgian insect feed company Millibeter,"03 Dec 2018 --- AgriProtein, one of the leading firms in insect technology and fly farming, is looking to expand its reign on the European market by acquiring Millibeter, a Belgian headquartered insect feed company. AgriProtein will fund the construction of the first full-scale Millibeter factory in Belgium. The business move comes at a time when EU focus starts to shift towards alternative sources of protein, with insect protein gaining momentum.

Based in Turnhout, in the Belgian province of Antwerp, Millibeter utilizes the black soldier fly to convert EU-approved organic substrates like vegetable waste into useful products for the feed and pharmaceutical industries.

Previously, AgriProtein announced a joint venture with Sustainable Protein in the Netherlands and this, in combination with the acquisition of Millibeter, establishes AgriProtein’s presence in the Benelux region and reinforces its position as the world’s leading up-cycler of organic substrate to protein.

“Outside of Europe, we are expanding in Asia, California, the Middle East, and South Africa. Millibeter was chosen as the best-suited company for acquisition as it has several complementary technologies, an experienced team of staff, as well as a vision and mission that fits well with that of AgriProtein’s,” Ian John Banks, AgriProtein Executive Assistant tells FoodIngredientsFirst. “Our next step is to break ground in two factories in Europe in 2019 as part of our global factory roll-out,” he adds.

AgriProtein has raised US$105 million since June 2018 and is building a global business through its circular economy model: upcycling organic substrate into insect protein. The company uses black soldier flies and their larvae to turn these organic materials into a high-protein alternative to fishmeal for use in aquaculture feeds.

Jason Drew, AgriProtein CEO, says: “We look forward to welcoming Millibeter into the AgriProtein family. It will accelerate our EU expansion, adding an experienced team who will bring complementary technologies to our growing business.”

Millibeter CEO, Johan Jacobs, along with an assortment of entomologists, organic chemists and engineers will form a new AgriProtein European R&D team.

“The team at Millibeter are excited to join AgriProtein and add value to their global project roll-out plans and R&D programs. We have always believed in the potential of the organic nutrient recycling market in Europe. This investment is a significant vote of confidence in that industry,” Jacobs comments.

Prior to AgriProtein’s acquisition of Millibeter, the latter received investments by Belgian investors and the Innovation Fund, which invests in innovative start-ups and companies in the field of chemistry and life sciences.

François Cornelis, Chairman of the Innovation Fund, says: “We believe that Millibeter will become a major player in the circular economy in the Benelux region, following our investment and the agreed friendly takeover.”

Using Belgium as its base, Agriprotein aims to build several plants across Europe. Additionally, the Innovation Fund offers Agriprotein access to their network of specialty chemical and life sciences companies.

“EU regulations are stricter than in any other parts of the world. This is one of the reasons why we value the investment of AgriProtein in Europe, and particularly in the Benelux region. We have supported Millibeter for the past two years and the friendly takeover by AgriProtein will allow the company to become a major actor in the circular economy in Europe, with two plants in Belgium and least one in the Netherlands and hopefully more,” Edith Coune, Innovation Fund General Secretary, tells FoodIngredientsFirst.

Drew says: “The company has recently expanded its R&D capability to over 45 people based in its state-of-the-art chemistry and genetics laboratories in Cape Town. It has also hired senior staff from engineering and organic substrate management backgrounds to increase its project roll-out capacity. The company is focusing on the aquafeed market, where demand is increasing year on year to satisfy increasing consumer demand for farmed fish.”According to Reuters, the aquafeed industry is predicted to double by 2026 and was worth over US$100 billion in 2017.

“There is simply not enough marine material left in the oceans to meet fishmeal demand in aquafeed, let alone in other markets. Along with algae and bacteria, new, disruptive sources of protein like our own are needed to close the feed gap and, in the process, help repair the future of the planet,” adds Drew.

Interest in alternative proteins and sustainable food production continues to rise, and the European umbrella organization representing the interests of the International Platform of Insects for Food and Feed (IPIFF) has emphasized the potential of the European insect sector in creating a more competitive and sustainable value chain. IPIFF President Antoine Hubert believes that the current European Regulations and EU funded research programs offer many opportunities for insect producers to develop, but the current regulatory framework must be adapted to ensure that this potential can be fully exploited.

Gathering in Brussels for the IPIFF 2018 Annual Conference last month, 200 participants, including European Commission Officials, Member States representatives and other delegates ranging from the insect sector, agri-food industry and scientists, recalled the potential laying in insects for food and feed, while highlighting the importance of EU legislation for the development of the sector. The event also explored different avenues for insect producers to best respond to European consumers and farmers’ demands, notably in the context of the EU Protein Plan.

Moreover, last month, the European Commission adopted a report on the “Development of Plant Proteins in the European Union” intended to explore new pathways in response to the protein deficit in Europe. The document was presented on the occasion of a high-level conference co-organized with the Austrian presidency in Vienna. In light of the report, the IPIFF combined forces with the European Algae Biomass Association (EABA) to propose a more inclusive EU action plan in favor of algae and insects as alternative protein sources.

Insect proteins hold potential for global nutrition and have come into the spotlight over the past years as being a good source of healthy protein and several other nutrients, as well as more environmentally friendly in their production than many other animal-derived proteins. The one gallon of water it takes to produce one pound of insect protein pales in comparison to the almost two thousand gallons of water poured into every pound of beef destined for human consumption, for example. The shift from mainstream food to feed will remain a challenge, however, as the western “yuck” factor widely associated with insects will need to be overcome.

341,Calls for better plastic waste management,"The current global practice of production, over-consumption and disposal of plastic products has birthed countless never-ending environmental, social-economic, climatic and well-being problems within our societies. Poor end-of-life management and governance of billions upon billions of disposed plastic products has led to plastic waste filling our lands, oceans, lakes and rivers, as well as the stomachs of an estimated 600 species of animals around the world.

Sustainability in our plastic consumption cannot be achieved without altering the current systems of plastic governance, consumption and management. While acknowledging the importance of this ubiquitous material in our daily life, there are calls for modifications to our relationship with plastic. Sime Darby Plantations’ Chief Sustainability Officer, Dr. Simon Lord, highlighted the need to re-evaluate how we manage plastic disposal in the face of increasing demand for more land for agriculture and infrastructure.

“Plastic is a generational issue. We are leaving a legacy for millennials, the children that we are educating, that is potentially a world that is not fit for them to live in and meet their future requirements,” said Lord, putting the onus on the shoulders of the current generation. He said this at the recent ‘Reimagining Southeast Asia 2018’ forum organised by The ASEAN Post.

The Southeast Asian region dominated the global list of countries ranked by mass of mismanaged plastic waste or waste that is either littered or inadequately disposed in dumps or open landfills. The five countries, namely Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, collectively contribute 8.9 million metric tons of mismanaged plastic waste annually. According to global statistics, ASEAN countries contribute 60 percent of marine debris.

At a national level, regional plastic waste management requires a spectrum of solutions, with focus on infrastructure for sufficient and proper collection and disposal in markets where this has yet to be provided, tied together to good policies. The World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Head of Circular Economy Initiative Antonia Gawel, said that while national governments need to set the tone for their countries’ ambitions, a lack of data on material flow in this space is a big challenge.

Gawel explained that for better plastic waste management, the Global Plastic Action Partnership (GPAP) currently hosted by the WEF is identifying gaps in available data, as well as looking at systems that are needed to be put in place across different countries to improve data collection. Gawel puts forth a need for a systematic approach to govern plastic waste similar to the governance of climate change action under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

“We now have a systematic approach for governments to report on emission, energy, and quite a lot of indicators through the UNFCCC. What we need to do is to improve our systematic indicator set in this sector, across many countries. The ideal outcome would be a possible partnership and a system in place to improve data collection and reporting.

“Do we need a global plastics convention? It can have benefits in terms of setting a common framework for reporting and requiring governments to create plans and report against plans. At the same time, what we also know is that we really need leadership at the national level to drive implementation in real time. We are also seeing quite a lot of regional collaboration,” said Gawel, stressing the need to learn from other existing conventions.

Currently, international monitoring on plastic is limited to imported and exported plastic waste that is regulated under the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal. The Basel Convention focusses on hazardous waste and only concerns plastic waste that crosses national borders. Its primary objective is to end the practice of toxic colonialisation or dumping of industrial and hazardous wastes in territories of developing countries and countries with economies in transition by more developed ones.

The UNFCCC is a framework for international cooperation to combat climate change by limiting average global temperature increases and the resulting climate change. Under the UNFCCC, signatories are required to submit national communications to report on actions and tracking of progress towards emissions reduction targets and existing gaps in climate change mitigation, adaptation and financing.

The magnitude of the plastic waste problem is only going to increase with the continuous demand for this highly malleable material. Collaboration at national, regional and international levels need to be well coordinated to bring about effective and long-lasting change.",United States,2018.12

344,How Google Keeps Its Power-Hungry Operations Carbon Neutral,"Kate Brandt has a radical idea for how we’ll have to live in the future, if we’re going to be in balance with nature. She envisions a world without landfills, where ownership is obsolete, and everything down to the socks on our feet is rented and shared. Brandt is Google's sustainability officer. And she’s obsessed with one idea: the “circular economy,” which aims to eliminate waste. This would require products and materials to be kept in use, rather than thrown away, and for the world to be powered by renewable energy.

At Google, Brandt is employing this ethos at scale. At TEDWomen 2018, a conference for women thought leaders in Palm Desert, California, this week, she issued a challenge to the rest of the tech industry to do the same.

The timing is good—and necessary. A recent report from the US government paints a dire picture of what will happen to our planet if we don’t aggressively counteract climate change in the next decade. That’s in line with the UN’s report from October,which concluded that humans have about 12 years to reverse current trends before we do irreversible harm.

Brandt is focused on implementing this vision at the buildings that house Google employees and at Google’s 14 data centers around the globe. The company has been carbon-neutral since 2007, which requires a lot of work to offset its substantial power demands. Google achieves this three ways, according to its most recent Environmental Report: by reducing its demand, by buying renewables to match its use of non-renewable energy, and with other offsets, like capturing methane gas from animal waste.

Data centers are a large source of emissions. According to a recent report in the journal Nature, data centers use 200 terawatts of energy a year—roughly 1 percent of global electricity use.

Google estimates that each search emits roughly 0.2 grams of CO into the atmosphere, due to the energy it takes to power the cables, routers, and servers that make Google work. That's on par with the energy it takes to power a lightbulb for 17 seconds. Watching or uploading a video to YouTube is worse for the environment: 1 gram of carbon for every 10 minutes of viewing, according to The Guardian. Experts estimate that internet companies put out as much CO as the airline industry.1

As Google grows, “We are committed to neutralizing all the carbon emissions associated with our operations,” Brandt says. That sounds great, but how do you actually do it?

“First we applied machine learning to the cooling of data centers,” Brandt says, cutting energy use by the cooling system by 30 percent.

Google designed servers that will last longer and be easier to reuse. “We are taking components from old servers, and we are keeping them in our new machines. We’re remanufacturing new servers from old ones. And we sell old servers on secondary markets after wiping them clean,” she says. In 2017, that meant 18 percent of Google’s new servers were remanufactured machines, and 11 percent of components used for machine upgrades were refurbished inventory. The company sold more than 2 million used machines to others.

Google also bought 3 gigawatts of wind and solar last year to offset the energy use of its data centers, allowing the company for the first time to match 100 percent of its energy use with renewables. Though that tactic has long been a component of its carbon-neutral effort, 2017 was the first year it was able to buy enough clean energy to offset all its data center energy consumption. “For every kilowatt-hour of energy we consume, we add a matching kilowatt-hour of renewable energy to a power grid somewhere,” Urs Hölzle, a Google senior vice president, wrote in a blog post earlier this year.",United States,2018.12
345,Plastics maker Dow takes aim at plastic waste in the oceans,"MIDLAND, MI - Dow Chemical Co. is joining forces with two other groups to help keep plastic waste out of the environment, including the world's oceans.

The Midland-based chemical giant announced it will become a founding investor in Circulate Capital's $100 million effort to incubate and finance companies and infrastructure that prevent waste in the oceans.

A spokesperson for the Dow declined to comment on how much it has pledged, but did say it is one of the companies placing an initial investment in the organization. Other companies include PepsiCo Inc. and The Coca-Cola Co.

According to Circulate Capital's website, it is an investment management firm financing innovation, companies and infrastructure that prevent the flow of plastic waste into the world's oceans.

At a recent conference in Bali, Indonesia, Dow also announced it will donate $1 million to Ocean Conservancy over the next two years to support waste collection and recycling in Southeast Asian countries.

""There are a couple of primary reasons these actions are important to Dow,"" said Mike Witt, Dow's corporate director of Plastics Circular Economy. ""Dow is one of the world's largest producers of plastics, more specifically, polyethylene resins, specialty resins and adhesives (and) we are a leading innovator across the value chain on sustainable application development and circular economy life-cycle design for plastics.""

The circular economy is when there is an effort to reduce or reuse waste, as opposed to a linear economy, which uses and then disposes of waste.

Dow's $1 million donation to Ocean Conservancy builds on the more than 20-year relationship between the two organizations, according to the news release.

Witt added that the issue of plastic waste in the oceans is critical because ""every person on earth deserves to live in a clean, healthy environment"" and that plastic waste does not belong in the environment.

""Circulate Capital's work is important because it empowers local people in the regions most impacted by lack of waste management infrastructure to develop actionable and scalable solutions within their communities,"" said Diego Donoso, business president of Dow Packaging and Specialty Plastics, in a statement.

A news release states that the areas across South and Southeast Asia are contributing disproportionately to ocean plastic pollution primarily because the region lacks the waste infrastructure to manage the problem.

With this news, Witt said it allows Dow to collaborate with governments to make changes in consumer behavior, make infrastructure investment and support technology investments.

Witt also added some actions have started, and with respect to their involvement with Circulate Capital, Dow plans to making initiative investments in 2019.",United States,2018.12
346,Stella McCartney Helps Launch New Sustainable Fashion UN Charter,"Fashion designer Stella McCartney plans to announce a United Nations fashion industry charter for climate action in early December, the Guardian reports.

The new charter will launch on December 10 during the Katowice Climate Change Conference in Poland (COP24), according to the news outlet. Besides McCartney, other signatories are expected to include large brands known for fast fashion.

“There is a reason the fashion industry clings to old-fashioned ways of doing things — it is cheaper and it is easier,” McCartney told the Guardian’s Jess Cartner-Morley. “What is essential is for the big players in the industry to come along with me, because that changes the price point.”

Approximately 30 to 40 international high fashion brand CEOs will be in attendance when McCartney unveils the charter next month, Cartner-Morley reported.

Earlier this month, the United Nations Environment Program released an article pointing out that the fashion industry produces 20% of global wastewater and 10% of global carbon emissions. “Textile dyeing is the second largest polluter of water globally and it takes around 2,000 gallons of water to make a typical pair of jeans,” the program says.

The UN Environment Program also noted that last year McCartney collaborated with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation on a Circular Fibers report proposing a new system based on circular economy principles. With backing from Nike and H&M, the report highlighted several key ambitions for a new textiles economy that included breaking away from disposable clothing, phasing out substances of concern, and radically improving recycling.

McCartney told the Guardian that she doesn’t want to pressure them into prioritizing sustainability but get them excited about participating. “We can only fix this mess if we work together,” she said.",United States,2018.12
347,Showing off: Notes from Session 5 of TEDWomen 2018,"The term “showing off” gets a bad rap. But for Session 5 of TEDWomen 2018, a lineup of speakers and performers reclaimed the phrase — showing off their talents, skills and whole extraordinary selves. Hosted by TED’s head of conferences, Kelly Stoetzel, and head of curation, Helen Walters, the talks ranged from architecture and the environment to education and grief, taking on the fundamental challenges that we face as humans. The session featured Ane Brun, Kotchakorn Voraakhom, Kate E. Brandt, Danielle R. Moss, Carla Harris, Helen Marriage and Nora McInerny.

It all starts with a dramatic opening. The session starts with an air of anticipation, thanks to multi-instrumentalist Ane Brun‘s opening number, “It All Starts With One.” This cabaret workout for piano and string quartet is based on “the revolution of dreams” of the Arab Spring, written to celebrate “small victories … that little drop that I, as an individual, can add to the flood of change.” Her intimate follow-up number, “You Light My Fire,” is “a statue in the shape of a song” dedicated to the unacknowledged warriors who fight for women’s rights.

Our sinking cities. At this very moment, 48 major cities across the globe are sinking — cities like New York City, Los Angeles, London, Tokyo, Shanghai and Bangkok, built on the soft ground alongside their rivers. Landscape architect and TED Fellow Kotchakorn Voraakhom comes from Bangkok herself and was displaced, along with millions of others, by the devastating flood that hit Thailand in 2011. “Our city’s modern infrastructure — especially our notion to fight floods with concrete — has made us extremely vulnerable to climate uncertainty,” she says. In the years since, she’s worked to combine the ingenuity of modern engineering with the reality of rising sea levels to help cities live with climate change. She and her team designed the Chulalongkorn Centenary Park, a big green crack in the heart of Bangkok and the city’s first new public park in more than three decades. The park is not only a site for recreation and beautification; it also helps the city deal with water through some ingenious design. Bangkok is a flat city, so by inclining the whole park, it harnesses the power of gravity to collect every drop of rain — holding and collecting up to a million gallons of water during severe floods. “This park is not about getting rid of flood water,” she says. “It’s about creating a way to live with it.” In a sinking city where every rainfall is a wake-up call, this “amphibious design” provides new hope of making room for water.

“Greening” Google with a circular approach. “What if, like nature, everything was repurposed, reused and reborn for use again?” asks Google’s head of sustainability, Kate E. Brandt, who is in charge of “greening” the tech giant. Every time someone completes a search on Google or uploads a video to YouTube, Google’s data centers are hard at work — filled with servers using a significant amount of energy. And with demand for energy and materials only continuing to grow, Brandt’s work is to figure a sustainable path forward. Her idea? To create a circular economy grounded in three tenets: designing out waste, keeping products and materials in use, and transitioning to renewable energy. In this circular world, all goods would be designed to be easily repaired and remanufactured. She imagines, for instance, that even clothes and shoes could be leased and returned — with old clothes going back to the designer to reuse the materials for a new batch of clothing. “If we each ask ourselves, ‘What can I do to positively impact our economy, our society, our environment?’ — then we will break out of the global challenges that have been created by our take-make-and-waste economy, and we can realize a circular world of abundance,” she says.

Tapping into the forgotten middle. We all know “the forgotten middle” — “they’re the students, coworkers and plain old regular folks who are often overlooked because they’re seen as neither exceptional nor problematic,” says activist and former educator Danielle R. Moss. But, she says, there is more here. “I think there are some unclaimed winning lottery tickets in the middle,” Moss says. “I think the cure for cancer and the path to world peace might very well reside there.” Moss has spent much of her career trying to help this group reach their full potential. In middle school, she herself was languishing in that strata, until her mother noticed and set her on a different path. Later, in New York City, Moss helped create a program to work with the forgotten middle and identified some of the core elements of a formula to motivate them. These include holding kids to high expectations (instead of asking, “Hey, do you want to go to college?”, ask, “What college would you like to attend?”), giving them “the hidden curriculum” needed to succeed (study skills, leadership development, liberal-arts coursework and adult support), and making them accountable to themselves, each other and their communities (seeing themselves as belonging to a group of young people who came from the same backgrounds and who were all aspiring for more). Moss says, “When I think of my kids, and I think of all the doctors, lawyers, teachers, social workers and artists who came from our little nook in New York City, I hate to think what wouldn’t have happened if we hadn’t invested in the kids in the middle.”

In our careers, we all need a sponsor. Corporate America insists it is a meritocracy — a place where those who succeed simply “put their heads down and work really hard.” But former Wall Street banker Carla Harris tells us this simple truth: that’s not the case. To really move forward and be recognized for your work, you need someone else to make a case for you — especially in those pivotal decisions that are often made behind closed doors. This person isn’t a mentor, champion or advocate — but a sponsor, someone who is “carrying your paper into the room … pounding the table on your behalf.” Sponsors need three things: a seat at the table, power in the decision-making process and an investment in you and your work. Harris says you can attract a sponsor by utilizing two forms of social capital: performance currency, which you gain when you perform beyond expectations, and relationship currency, which you gain by engaging meaningfully with the people around you. “You can survive a long time in your career without a mentor,” Harris says, “but you are not going to ascend in any organization without a sponsor.”

A moment when curiosity triumphs over suspicion, and delight banishes anxiety. Designer Helen Marriage brings people together through larger-than-life art and spectacle. “I want to take you to a different kind of world — a world of the imagination where using this most powerful tool that we have, we can transform our physical surroundings,” she says. With Artichoke, the company she cofounded in 2006, Marriage seeks to create moving, ephemeral moments that reveal beauty among ruins, reexamine history and whimsically demonstrate what’s possible. Why? “In doing so, we can change forever how we feel, and how we feel about the people we share the planet with.” On the TEDWomen stage, Marriage tells the tale of three cities she transformed into spaces of culture and connection. In Salisbury, French actors performed Faust on stilts with handheld pyrotechnics; in London, she conjured magic by shutting down the city streets for four days to tell the story of a little girl and an elephant. And in Derry (also known as Londonderry) — a town still gripped by Northern Ireland’s Protestant/Catholic conflict — she helped address community tribalism in Burning Man fashion, building a wooden temple that housed written hopes, thoughts, loves and losses — then burning it down. Reminiscent of a town ritual that usually deepens rifts, the work brought thousands of people together on both sides to share and experience a deeply profound moment. As she says: “In the end, this is all about love.”

Moving forward doesn’t mean moving on. In a heartbreaking, hilarious talk, writer and podcaster Nora McInerny shares her hard-earned wisdom about life and death. In 2014, soon after losing her second pregnancy and her father, McInerny’s husband Aaron died after three years fighting brain cancer. Since then, McInerny has made a career of talking about life’s hardest moments — not just her own, but also the losses and tragedies that others have experienced. She started the Hot Young Widows Club, a series of small gatherings where men and women can talk about their partners who have died and say the things that other people in their lives aren’t yet willing to hear. “The people who we’ve lost are still so present for us,” she says. Now remarried, McInerny says that we need to change how we think about grief — that it’s possible to grieve and love in the same year and week, even the same breath. She invites us to stop talking about “moving on” after the death of a loved one: “I haven’t moved on from Aaron, I’ve moved forward with him,” she says. And she encourages us to remind one another that some things can’t be fixed, and not all wounds are meant to heal.",United States,2018.12
348,German Plastics Packaging Industry Sets itself Ambitious Recycling Targets for 2025,"Handling resources in an efficient and responsible manner has long played an important role in the German plastics packaging industry – in ecological as well as in economic terms. While the arguments for plastics packaging are convincing with regard to functionality and efficient use of resources, the German plastics packaging industry, under the umbrella of the IK Industrievereinigung Kunststoffverpackungen (German Association for Plastics Packaging and Films), has now set itself ambitious but also realistic targets to strengthen closed loop recycling.

With these targets, the industry, which comprises predominantly medium-sized businesses, is making its contribution towards a sustainable plastics packaging strategy and taking a stand against the sweeping condemnation of plastic packages with commitment and facts in the emotional and negatively charged public debate.

By 2025, at least 1 million tonnes of recycling material or renewable raw materials will be used in the production of plastic packaging in Germany. This, in turn, will replace 1 million tonnes of new product made from petroleum. Processors will need reliable volumes of recycling material of an adequate quality in order to be able to meet this target. In addition to the efforts being made in this matter by the waste management and recycling industry, a major prerequisite is a close alliance with the bottling and packing industry. “If the retail trade and brand owners accept and demand the use of recycled material and renewable raw materials to a greater extent than is the case today, the plastics packaging industry will be able to offer innovative and sustainable packaging solutions,” says IK General Manager Dr Jürgen Bruder, explaining one of the major hurdles that need to be taken in the interest of the environment. “The important thing here is to resolve the conflict of aims between ecological design and marketing.”

According to the latest figures, German manufacturers already use 400,000 tonnes of recycled material in the production of plastic packages. The EU Commission is calling for the use of a total of 10 million tonnes of recycled material in the European packaging industry by 2025. “By significantly expanding the volume of recycling material used from the current level of 400,000 tonnes to 1 million tonnes, we wish to meet our responsibility and give a clear signal that Germany is not just sitting back with the milestones achieved so far in the circular economy, but also intends to strengthen its leading role in Europe,” states IK Managing Director Dr Isabell Schmidt.

By 2025, at least 90 per cent of household packaging will be capable of being recycled or reused. Over 75 per cent of plastic packages are already capable of being recycled or reused in terms of volumes collected for the “Yellow Sack” and PET drinks bottles collection schemes. “We regard the 90 per cent target we aim to meet not just as realistic but also as ecologically sound,” explains Dr Schmidt. “On the one hand, we cannot set a 100 % target for the overall market, which sees many packaged products imported from abroad. On the other hand, people need to realise that the necessary changes to some packages may even have a negative impact on their overall ecological footprint, as more material is required.” One example are the ultra-thin films with highly effective barrier layers to protect sensitive foodstuffs. Rejecting these highly innovative solutions in favour of recyclability will result in the use of considerably more material to achieve the same level of performance, if that is at all possible. “There is, however, still a lot of potential in some areas to improve recyclability without detracting from the efficiency of the material. That's what we intend to concentrate on,” states Dr Schmidt.

An independent third party is to monitor on a regular basis how the two sustainability targets are being met.

The current status of sustainability in the plastics packaging industry is documented with the corresponding key indicators in the recently published IK Sustainability Report 2018. It also includes the IK’s position on the EU’s plastics strategy and the IK's recycling targets.",United States,2018.12
351,The EU's New Environmental Initiatives Present Opportunities for Brands,"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

Entrepreneurs are faced with increasing pressure to create businesses that not only meet the requirements of their target customers but also societal expectations. Slogans such as ""doing well by doing good,"" ""triple bottom line"" and ""get one, give one"" encapsulate customer expectations of quality.

Through its Zero Waste Europe initiative, the European Union has been at the forefront of mechanisms to promote zero waste and a circular economy through the empowerment of ""communities and change agents from around Europe to redesign their relationship with resources, to adopt smarter lifestyles and sustainable consumption patterns in line with 'circular' resource management.""

These political and societal expectations are creating disruption in markets through the establishment of regulations that govern acceptable entrepreneurial and corporate behavior in itself presenting challenges and opportunities.

Do we have to choose planet or profit?

The European Union Directive on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment created in wake of increasing public concern of the impact of single-use plastic materials on marine life seeks to reduce the recurrence of the top 11 categories of marine litter found on Europe's beaches namely:
• Beverage containers, their caps and lids, and beverage bottles
• Sanitary items such as wet wipes and sanitary towels

The top 10 categories of marine litter are trappings of the 21st-century lifestyles, creating a dilemma of ""planet or profit."" In essence, the strategic challenge facing entrepreneurs is that sustainability is good, but who is going to pay for it?

Related: European Companies Are Leading the Way on Plastic Waste Reduction, But More Needs to Be Done

What does a ""virtuous brand"" look like?

The emergence of the EU ban on single-use plastics provides fertile ground for businesses to rethink their strategy by building a ""virtuous brand."" Entrepreneurs have an opportunity to be leaders in creating virtuous brands and building caring organizations. Brands such as Lush have demonstrated the success of virtuous branding by building a loyal customer base focused on developing beauty products that are handmade and non-animal tested, ethical buying and championing a concept of ""naked packaging"" -- a nearly package-free shopping experience.

These values have been essential to their brand image of ""embodied care,"" interweaving three elements of ""caring knowledge"" -- taking action on the environment internally using recycled materials, exceeding legal compliance obligations, acting as a recycling center for plastic packaging and championing charitable causes that resonate with customers; ""caring habits"" -- consistently contributing to the sustainable health and well-being of its customers through chemical-free, vegetarian product development, adopting green transport policies opting for ""trains rather than planes"" for employee transport; and exhibiting ""caring imagination"" -- influencing customers' behavior to adopt environmentally conscious lifestyles.

Lush expects to provide working conditions for staff that go beyond what is legally required, to have no staff member on a zero hours contract and to go so far as to offer a paid holiday for permanent staff on their birthday.

Learn about your own personal practices first by doing a personal audit:
• How well do you care for yourself?
• How many chemicals are in your body products and home?
• How much waste do you create?

When you become mindful of the impact you are having in your own life on your health and that of your environment you will realize these are the same habits you lead within your business.

Developing better habits and sharing them in your business will influence the people around you who will respond to your virtuous leadership. Change is an inside job first. The more care you take of yourself the more alert to your impact on the environment you are and the changes that are needed in the business will start to become clearer. Then you can develop a plan with your team focusing on one area at a time, transforming this into a collaborative experience in your business. Make sure at this point you go back to step one and figure out what is best practice for your proposed change, allowing you to come back to your development stage.

Implement the plan you have developed with your team. This experience should be fun and can really transform your business. A great case study of this is Rabbie's Trail Burners Ltd, an award-winning small business in Scottish tourism sector that earned the Visions in Business for the Environment of Scotland (VIBES) Award in 2011. Its virtuous brand focus helped them achieve £3.4 million turnover in 2011.

Optimizing your plan on a continual basis will allow you to navigate the changing environmental climate for business. This will allow you to not only keep up with new legislation and best practice but it will also build your brand loyalty.

Sustaining your efforts and that of your team will mean celebrating your wins and inspiring your team. Creating champions of change within the business is a key part of this. Celebration is also a great opportunity to share with your customers your outstanding virtuous brand.

Each time you want to implement a new change, go back to the beginning of the process again.",United States,2018.12
364,Ebro Foods Joins CEFLEX To Improve Packaging Sustainability,"Published on Mar 31 2019 1:29 PM in Packaging And Design tagged: Spain Packaging Ebro Foods CEFLEX

Spanish food company Ebro Foods has joined CEFLEX, a consortium of companies and associations that represent the value chain of flexible packaging and collaboration, in a bid to develop more sustainable packaging formats.

365,"Cyprus celebrates Earth Hour, central event takes place at Presidential Palace","The central celebration to mark this year’s Earth Hour took place Saturday evening at the Presidential Palace where President Nicos Anastasiades announced the appointment of Professor Costas Papanikolas, President of the Cyprus Institute (CyI), as his special adviser for Climate Change. Celebrations took place in other cities as well.

Speaking at the event at the Presidential Palace, President Anastasiades said that Professor Papanikolas will work closely with the Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Environment in order to coordinate the actions that need to take place for our country to become a research center. He added that the aim is to implement at national and regional level the findings of the Regional Action Plan that Cyprus proposed to the European Commission.

The President pointed out that the threats of climate change are there and they are visible and we should not underestimate them otherwise the impacts will be tragic for the ecosystem, the economy and our everyday lives.

He spoke of the disastrous impacts of global warming, of the prolonged periods of drought and heavy rainfall, water scarcity, heatwaves and the loss of biodiversity, pointing out that these adverse effects of climate change are more intense in almost all regions of the world.

President said that the situation is critical and it is imperative that we took effective measures and implement all the necessary policies to ensure the long-term sustainable development of our planet.

In his speech the President referred to the measures the EU is putting forward to tackle the situation and the objectives and commitments for 2030 Framework.

He added that in Cyprus we are already taking steps for clean and green energy with the use of renewable energy sources and with plans for energy saving.

The President said that studies show that the Mediterranean region is one of the regions worst affected by climate change and this is one of the main reasons Cyprus proposed to the EC the implementation of a regional action plan to address the visible environmental and other risks in the area. According to the President this is an initiative that will be supported by ongoing research and the set-up of a dialogue forum for discussion and exchange of views and suggestions.

In this framework, he noted, we are in contact with internationally renowned Professor Jeffrey Sacks, who is the Advisor to the UN Secretary-General for Sustainable Development Goals, and through bilateral and trilateral meetings we have been promoting our goals and ideas.

In her address the Commissioner for the Environment Ioanna Panayiotou pointed out that it is no exaggeration to say that climate change is the greatest environmental, economic and social crisis in the history of mankind.

She said that the climate change has become a key priority for the European Union and added that it is crucial to achieve the EU`s 2020 and 2030 targets to turn economy into a highly energy-efficient and low-carbon one.

Panayiotou said that UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that if the temperature rises above 1.5 degrees Celsius, the loss of nature would be irreversible. She added that mitigation of the expected impacts on Cyprus is possible, provided that measures are taken on time.

The Commissioner added that development based on wrong and unsustainable models leads to climate change and this is the reason is crucial to take actions for sustainable development and circular economy.",United States,2019.03
367,New plan to completely ban single-use plastic bags and microbeads in Australia,"Single-use plastic bags and microbeads will be banned across Australia from 2021 if Labor wins the upcoming federal election.

The move, designed to protect vulnerable wildlife and reduce the amount of waste generated, is part of a planned $290 million spend by Labor aimed at making Australia cleaner for future generations.

“Plastic has a devastating impact on our natural environment – more than a third of the world’s sea turtles were found to have plastic waste in their stomachs, and it is estimated around 90 per cent of seabirds eat plastic waste,” a joint statement from Opposition Leader Bill Shorten, Labor Senators Penny Wong and Kim Carr and environment spokesman Tony Burke said on Sunday.

If Labor wins government they will consult with states, territories and industry on how best to introduce the ban, which the party said would create consistency after many jurisdictions moved to phase out plastic bags.

Other planned initiatives include a national container deposit scheme, a $60 million national recycling fund, the appointment of a national waste commissioner, and $15 million to help neighbouring countries clean up the Pacific Ocean.

“Australians want action from government to help reduce waste and build a circular economy,” the Opposition’s statement said.

“So while many Australians do their duty – they recycle, compost, use keep cups for their morning coffee – we need the government to take a leading role to tackle some of the big, structural problems.”",United States,2019.03

370,The power of recycled content in packaging,"The circular economy is on a roll—and using recycled-content material in packages is one way to ensure U.S. recycling businesses will succeed. But reliable sourcing and quality can be a challenge. Here are tips from sustainably driven brands Lush Fresh Handmade Cosmetics and Annie’s on how they are not just coping but excelling.

Karen Moll, print and gift packaging buyer with Lush Fresh Handmade Cosmetics, and Patrick Keenan, packaging engineer at General Mills (who leads packaging R&D for the Annie’s brand), will be among expert panelists discussing recycled content at SPC Impact 2019 (Apr. 1-4, Seattle, WA), the leading sustainable packaging conference organized by the Sustainable Packaging Coalition. Taking place on Tues., Apr. 2, the “Knowledge Café: Scaling Recycled Content Adoption in Packaging” panel discussion will help demystify the world of recycled content.

Here, Moll and Keenan talk about lessons learned, ocean plastic, consumer education and more.

What was your biggest challenge to using recycled-content material in product packaging and how did you solve or overcome it?

Keenan: As a brand, there were two key areas that were a challenge to implementing recycled content:

1. Educating brand marketers on the value to a ‘’closed-loop system” so they could see the value in it; and

Moll: The biggest challenge for me was just how resistant many of our print partners were to running 100% recycled paper. I heard a lot in my early days at Lush at how hard it was to get 100% recycled paper—how it would be too expensive, and when there were problems printing, it always came back to the properties of recycled material and we wouldn’t have these problems if it was virgin fiber paper.

I’ve just had to be relentless in our requirements. It’s the line in the sand to do business with Lush and the suppliers who want to work with us find a way to get the 100% recycled paper and run it to our high standards.

What lesson did you learn about incorporating recycled content in your packaging that you wish you had known before you started and why?

Moll: It was a bit of a black hole in terms of finding out who was producing 100% recycled paper and what grades existed. Different projects would come up out of the blue that had new paper requirements and then it was scrambling to find paper that worked.

I learned over time to partner with printers that understood our needs and were willing and open to including the mill in our paper discussions so both understood our vision and what we were trying to achieve. Over time I’ve been connecting more and more directly with the mills or reps to have these discussions but could have probably solved some heartache had I started those conversations earlier in my Lush career.

Keenan: Recycled-content packaging is like any new packaging material a brand is attempting to qualify.

There are many daunting hurdles that a brand needs to overcome to ensure that the packaging is safe for the consumer and does not impact the quality of the product. Tackling each concern one chunk at a time and qualifying it like any other packaging material makes it flow seamlessly through the process.

I have often heard companies in the packaging industry say that the brands aren’t willing to adopt recycled-content materials because of misconceptions around consumer beliefs with regards to appearance or concerns about the supply source. For our brand and consumers, this was/is non-existent, and I really want raw material suppliers and converters to understand that these minor visual defects or perceptions are actually not realized by consumers.

How important is it to explain to consumers how recycled-content packaging contributes to the business value of recycling? And how do you explain it to them?

Keenan: Did you know the back of a cereal box is the one of the most read packages? Annie’s Friends Cereal used the back of the box to highlight the benefit of recycled content [see photo at the top of this page]. We used a graphic of Bunny’s sorting their recycling and a game to pick out the types of materials. We used this to illustrate that by recycling these materials, they get reused into things like our cereal liner!

I also believe that there may be an industry-wide benefit to standardizing how we communicate recycled content using a similar approach as the How2Recycle Label to provide consistency to the consumer.

What do you most look for when sourcing packages with recycled content?

1. Lowering our overall “bunny footprint” while maintaining safe product. Bunny Footprint is how our brand communicates our overall carbon footprint, as our brand mascot Bernie is a bunny.

2. Being a leader in the industry and having a competitive advantage with differential packaging.

What characteristic about recycled-content packaging would you most like to improve and why?

4. Price and performance parity with virgin are key to driving acceptance.

Creating the ability to swap in and out of recycled content versus virgin seamlessly should be the end goal.

Moll: In terms of paper, I have no major complaints on any of the characteristics. There are going to be some inherent issues using recycled paper that we will probably never move away from. I’ve accepted that sometimes when we add certain finishes to the paper that there could be registration issues. But our suppliers have really exceeded expectations by working on running recycled paper to minimize any issues.

It can be challenging to bring on new suppliers that aren’t used to working with recycled paper. I wish it was more widely used so we can bring on new suppliers quicker with minimal problems.

When it comes to recycled content for plastic packaging, when does it make sense for brands to consider recycled ocean plastic and when does it not?

Keenan: This is a hot topic with our consumers. I think using any chance to educate consumer that a brand cares is a great way to build trust. Driving value for recycled content by including it in packaging drives up the price of recycled plastics and gives an incentive for people to collect plastic waste—thus helping to reduce ocean plastic.

So, either including actual ocean plastic or recycled content both are on the path to eliminating the problem.

Saudi Basic Industries Corp's (SABIC) investment plans will not be affected by oil giant, said SABIC Vice Chairman and CEO Yousef al-Bunyan.

Aramco's purchase of a 70 percent stake in the company would look to integrate assets with Aramco to boost growth, Bunyan told Reuters Friday.

Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil producer, agreed on Wednesday to buy the stake in SABIC from the Public Investment Fund (PIF) for USD69.1 billion in one of the biggest deals in the global chemical industry.

The deal will take six to 12 months to complete, and there won't be any layoffs, change in management or impact on SABIC's balance sheet, he told Reuters in a phone interview.

""Once the anti-trust clearance is obtained, then immediately we will put a team together to look at areas of synergies in order for us to leverage our shareholder value,"" he said.

Meanwhile, SABIC participated in Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) Annual Conference 2019 for the sixth time in a row, where it shed light on the need for joint development.

Chairman of SABIC Dr. Abdulaziz Saleh Aljarbou said that the old measures are no more sufficient to meet today’s needs, amid the changes in the economic scene. Therefore, regional cooperation has become more important than any other time to achieve sustainable and comprehensive growth.

Bunyan pointed out that China and Asia still represent a strategic market for SABIC amid keenness of relevant main bodies in the region to deepen joint work for the sake of achieving effective cooperation among territories.

377,A second life for digital debris,"Owais has astonishing hand-eye coordination. The 26-year-old picks up smartphone motherboards, or logic boards, with his right hand, runs his eyes over the integrated circuits (ICs) to see if they are intact, and throws the obsolete ones into a gunny sack. The good ones land in a different container. All this happens in a matter of seconds, the movements smooth and practised, like a reflex.

Another hectic weekday has just begun in the old Seelampur market in east Delhi and Owais is one of the numerous informal workers who are busy sorting electronic waste. It is a sunny March afternoon, but the tall residential and commercial buildings in the area prevent the sunlight from reaching the ground. Owais and I are seated on a raised gravel platform outside a small shop.

He has a lot to do—a big heap of green motherboards sits in front of him, ready for the picking-checking-throwing exercise. “I’ve been doing this for almost 12 years now. So I’m kind of experienced,"" he says, showing me his roughened palms and fingertips, when I ask him if he’s worried about injuring himself during the sorting process. He wears no protective gear.

A typical mobile phone is made up of industrial thermoplastics, ceramics, metals and other chemical compounds. Dismantling any electronic item means coming in direct contact with all these elements. Most of the workers in Seelampur do this with their bare hands.

This is how most of the informal e-waste sector in India goes about its business. The e-waste management rules of the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF) mandate that e-waste handlers should maintain a record of the e-waste collected, dismantled and sent to the recycler. But workers in this market seem oblivious to this. Most of the shops are in a shabby state, with little or no space to store the electronic items; much of it lies in the open. On one side of the road, two workers are loading used monitors on to a creaky rickshaw, while others are offloading underground transmission cables from a truck. All these items will either be taken apart here or sent on to scrap dealers.

Reaching the biggest wholesale market for e-waste in Delhi is not easy. The nearest Metro station is Welcome, on the Metro’s red line. A dingy underpass behind the station leads to the north Kanti Nagar area. Traversing narrow lanes, you eventually reach the Shahdara drain, which separates the congested residential area from the market.

The entire e-waste market in the old Seelampur area is concentrated in three-four alleys located parallel to the open drain. As you near the market, known as (or old) Seelampur, small garment outlets, butcher shops and sewing machine workshops give way to cramped shops where workers are busy shuffling through central processing unit (CPU) cabinets, server machines, electric motors and smartphones—in cramped working conditions. One fixture outside every shop is a weighing machine; the alleys are like minefields, with broken CPU cooling fans and wire strands strewn all around.

According to a report titled , a collaborative effort of the United Nations University, the International Telecommunication Union and the International Solid Waste Association, the total e-waste generated in Asia in 2016 was 18.2 million tonnes (mt). India’s share of this was around 2 mt. The report adds that India generates a tremendous amount of e-waste and even imports it from developed countries. The says over “one million poor people in India are involved in manual recycling operations"". A January Assocham-EY report on urban waste management solutions in India states that according to the Central Pollution Control Board, India has 214 authorized recyclers/dismantlers. In 2016-17, the recyclers treated only 0.036 mt of India’s 2 mt of e–waste, the report adds. Multiple studies and reports have estimated that almost 90% of the electronic waste in India is collected and processed by the informal sector.

Despite global rules seeking to regulate the export and import of e-waste, a new World Economic Forum, or WEF, report ( A New Circular Vision For Electronics: Time For A Global Reboot ) released in January suggests that large amounts are still shipped illegally. For instance, e-waste generated in Western Europe makes its way to China and India, among other countries. India has become one of the biggest dumping grounds. The report adds that in total, 1.3 mt of undocumented discarded electronic products are exported annually from the European Union. A July 2015 report in the environment publication says that according to estimates of the Directorate General of Foreign Trade, illegal import of e-waste in India stood at about 50,000 tonnes annually.

“The movement of waste in the informal sector in India and its ability to access waste from both institutional and individual generators is significant. When this waste enters the informal sector, it does not come back to the clean channels,""says Satish Sinha, associate director at Toxics Link, a Delhi-based environmental group that has been working on the policy side of waste and chemical management for over two decades. Toxics Link was one of the first organizations to study the electronic waste sector in India. In 2002-03, it released the report , studies for which were carried out through extensive fieldwork in Delhi.

It goes without saying that the situation becomes dangerous when this waste is recycled in ways that are damaging to the environment and the workers. E-waste dumped in landfills produces contaminated leachates—the liquid that drains or leaches from a landfill—which eventually pollute the groundwater. When incinerated, e-waste can produce toxic fumes that are damaging to both the human respiratory system and air quality. Even if the e-waste reaches the recycling stage, improper methods of recovery and recycling have a significant impact on the environment. Circuit boards are often burnt in the open to extract metals such as copper, but this also releases potentially hazardous elements such as lead and chromium into the surroundings. Workers have been known to suffer health issues ranging from respiratory ailments to skin disorders. Some e-waste compounds are also considered carcinogenic.

Electronic waste is now the fastest-growing waste stream globally.Worldwide, the report pegs generation at 44.7 mt. By 2021, projections estimate it at around 52 mt. This number is expected to reach 120 mt by 2050. The UN has termed it a “tsunami of e-waste"".

The WEF report suggests that a circular economy model in the electronics sector could not only increase the longevity of the products but also create better and safe jobs for informal workers. A circular economy, as opposed to today’s linear economy, would be a system where all materials, components are kept at their highest value, i.e. in good shape and working condition, at all times and in use for as long as possible. The report adds that to build a circular economy for electronics, products need to be designed for reuse, durability and safe recycling.

Going by the rules

The E-Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2011, were the first such regulations in India. Earlier, electronic waste was covered under the Hazardous Waste Management (HWM) Rules, 1989. The 2011 rules, which came into effect in May 2012, introduced the concept of EPR, or extended producer responsibility, making the producer or manufacturer responsible for the life cycle of the product. In other words, producers would be accountable for the collection of used goods, their recycling and final disposal.

In 2016, producers were given specific e-waste collection targets under EPR. The revised collection targets came into effect in October 2017. The rules were again amended in 2018, and included some changes in collection targets.

Under EPR, companies, producers and OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) are responsible for their products when these are discarded. So, producers pay for the cost of the collection, transportation, recycling and responsible disposal of these products. “The moment cost is externalized to waste, it becomes a challenge. If you internalize the cost, it becomes easier to handle. This is the significant difference and that is why EPR exists,"" Sinha says.

Chinese mobile maker Xiaomi has a “Take-back & Recycling Programme"" that adheres to the 2016 rules. The programme, started in October 2017, allows users to fill up an e-waste recycling form after logging into their Mi account. An authorized recycler then picks up the e-waste. Users can hand over mobile phones, chargers, power banks, headphones and other electronic products sold in India, irrespective of the brand. For every pick-up request, users also get a discount coupon that can be used for future purchases. “We have partnered with Karo Sambhav to set up over 1,100 e-waste collection points at Mi Homes and Mi authorized service centres in over 500 cities across India... We have collected over 60,000kg of overall e-waste in 2018 alone,"" says Muralikrishnan B., chief operating officer, Xiaomi India, on email.

Even Apple, which recorded global iPhone sales of 64.5 million units in the fourth quarter of 2018 (September-December) according to Gartner research data, has a “GiveBack"" programme that allows users to ship their old devices to a recycling partner.

Gurugram-based producer responsibility organization Karo Sambhav works with around 28 brands to meet their collection targets and conduct awareness programmes on their behalf. Pranshu Singhal, Karo Sambhav’s founder, says the introduction of EPR has led to quite a few solutions. “The focus has been on how to ensure that the collection is done by the informal sector, since it’s a livelihood issue, in a safe manner, but ensuring that the waste moves to responsible recyclers once it is collected,"" says Singhal.

Worldwide, 67 countries have legislation in place to deal with e-waste, according to the WEF report. This normally takes the form of EPR. But while this keeps a check on the e-waste being generated within a country, it doesn’t effectively check the export of e-waste to developing countries like India.

Export to developing countries is regulated under the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal. It has been ratified by 187 countries, including India. Apart from listing hazardous waste, it requires all the countries involved to agree in writing to any transboundary movement of waste. The hazardous waste should be packaged, labelled and transported in conformity with international rules and standards.

The real problem begins when these obsolete electronic items reach informal markets like the one in old Seelampur or places like Uttar Pradesh’s Moradabad, one of the biggest e-waste recycling hubs in the country. For this waste stream can contain up to 60 elements from the periodic table. Every product that comes through is different. Multiple brands have different manufacturing standards and use numerous elements, making the extraction and recycling process tricky.

Yet the economic value of e-waste can be immense, particularly from metals such as gold, silver, copper, platinum and palladium. According to the WEF report, there is 100 times more gold in a tonne of smartphones than in a tonne of gold ore. However, extracting these elements is not easy. “Processing e-waste is really difficult because of the presence of different elements. For instance, when you are trying to extract gold through hydrometallurgy (using a leaching agent), then you have to leave the other things out. Sometimes the cost of recovery is higher than the recovered value,"" says Akshay Jain, founder of e-waste management company Namo E-waste.

We are meeting Jain at his recycling unit on the outskirts of Delhi, near the heavily industrialized Faridabad area. To demonstrate how even a small smartphone needs precision dismantling, Jain shows me a makeshift cardboard box that contains components from a disassembled mobile phone. These include small LCD screens, speakers and earpieces, aluminium sheets and the phone’s plastic body. While some of these parts can be used again, most of it will be sold to scrap dealers for a nominal amount on a per kilogram basis. Some of the parts are sold for as little as 10 per kilogram.

Jain takes me on a tour of the recycling unit, which is spread across 75,000 sq. ft. However, unexpected rain makes it dangerous to be near the e-waste raw material, so Jain decides to show me the room where the refurbished products certified by the company are stored. Everything, from laptops and tablets to e-book readers, is stacked neatly on metallic shelves. There are similar inventory rooms for other bigger IT products: CPUs and computing servers that can be reused after repair.

“Refurbishing is the best method and least polluting way of recycling. These refurbished products, the IT goods specifically, are available for 30% of the price of a new product. In turn, it’s also making technology accessible to the underprivileged,"" says Jain, as we head to the disassembly room where workers are busy dismantling flat-screen televisions on a proper disassembly line. This room is also equipped with gas extraction shafts.

As the rain subsides, we move to the messier region: the sorting area for metals and plastics. It is here that the true nature of electronic waste is laid bare. Workers, wearing surgical masks and gloves, are busy tearing down washing machines and sorting out the plastic that will be thrown into shredding machines. On the other side of this sorting area are hundreds of iron, copper and aluminium bales that have been extracted from scrap and compressed. These bales will eventually be sent to foundries for final recycling.

One has to be careful in these surroundings. “Do you see this foam?"" Jain says, pointing to a small pile of insulation foam used in refrigerators that has been shredded to pieces and will be processed or recycled soon. “You can’t touch it with your bare hands. It will keep itching for hours because of the sulphur and phosphorus in it,"" he adds.

The setting at this recycling unit is diametrically opposite to the disorganized conditions in places like Seelampur. “We don’t have the infrastructure to handle the amount of e-waste that’s hitting us, either in India or globally. That’s a big problem. We also have a set of manufacturers who are manufacturing for use and dispose,"" says Manvel Alur, founder of the Bengaluru-based non-profit EnSYDE India.

The short life of electronics has been a much debated issue, especially in IT products. In industrial design, this policy is known as “planned obsolescence"", a deliberately implemented strategy that ensures any current version of a given product will become out of date or obsolete within a known time period. This means that consumers will eventually need replacements.

This is where EnSYDE India comes in. Since 2003, it has been working with companies, NGOs and institutions across India to reduce their environmental footprint. It designs and implements solutions—based on the behavioural patterns of the stakeholders involved—that improve resource-use efficiency, specifically in the areas of energy, water and waste.

One of EnSYDE India’s recent initiatives is the “bE-Responsible E-Waste"" programme, for which it has partnered with Saahas, a non-profit working in the field of waste management, which handles the logistics for the initiative. Started in November 2016, the aim is to encourage people to manage their e-waste responsibly. “We basically go and sensitize the community—schools, RWAs (resident welfare associations) and households—through different campaigns and formats. Once the stakeholders are on board, we start off with the collection system. We have a pick-up truck that goes to different locations. The second option, which is really popular, is the public drop-off boxes. We currently have these e-waste drop boxes in 32 locations across Bengaluru,"" says Alur.

The programme has covered around 40 wards in Bengaluru so far, reached out to more than 600,000 citizens and collected 29 tonnes of e-waste. Saahas also has a tie-up with recyclers authorized by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board to ensure that the e-waste collected is disposed of responsibly.

One of the many recommendations in the WEF report suggests the need for advanced ways of recycling and recapturing. A paper published in 2018 by the UK-based Ellen MacArthur Foundation ( ) says certain industry actions, if implemented, could drive the transition towards a circular economy. The use of automation in the disassembly and refurbishment processes could be one such move. “Improved automated processes can increase the number of products that can be treated and reduce the time they require to be treated,"" the paper adds.

A recycling procedure on similar lines was launched recently in Australia by Prof. Veena Sahajwalla, who heads the Centre for Sustainable Materials Research and Technology (SM@RT) at the University of New South Wales, Sydney. In April last year, Prof. Sahajwalla launched the world’s first e-waste microfactory, which is capable of transforming components from e-waste items into valuable materials for reuse. It uses small machines and pre-programmed robots to select different components from different e-waste items such as mobile phones, computers and printers.

“The discarded devices are first placed into a module to break them down. The next module involves a special robot to extract useful parts. Another module uses a small furnace to separate the metallic parts into valuable materials, while another one reforms the plastic into a high-grade filament suitable for 3D printing,"" she says on email. “These microfactories can operate on a site as small as 50 sq. m... and can be located wherever waste is stockpiled. This can be done at remote and regional locations and is perfectly suited to the systems that are already in place in India,"" says Prof. Sahajwalla, who started working on the idea of developing an e-waste microfactory more than 10 years ago.

Alur says bringing out the value of different components in e-waste is “really not rocket science""—she cites the organization’s work in managing medical waste (which involves unused or expired medication) as an example. “Your vitamins, supplements: They all have high-value ingredients that can be put back into the soil and improve its fertility. We are working with organizations downstream which extract these ingredients, put them into compost and resell it,"" says Alur on the phone. “Of course, the rest of the waste which cannot be recycled has to be incinerated but the remaining items have huge potential for being valuable again,"" she explains.

Refurbished products are another solution. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation paper cites research which shows that up to 50% of users would be willing to have used or refurbished products. Built on insights from over 40 interviews with leading companies and researchers, the paper is based on research supported by Google and was undertaken by the foundation in 2017.

User perception, of course, varies. Some users, such as “techies"" or “fashion-oriented"" users, may not be interested in refurbished products, but these groups only represent part of the market, the paper adds.

“The trust in a refurbished product is important. I need the assurance that I’ll get equally good service from a refurbished product as I would from a new one. What is the kind of warranty that I am being provided? Can I flaunt it? These are some of the things that need to be addressed,"" says Sinha.

Organizations are starting to recognize e-waste’s hidden economic value and reusability. Take, for instance, the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo—all the medals will be made from precious metals collected from recycled e-waste. More than five million used phones were collected from among 47,488 tonnes of discarded electronic devices, after a nationwide scheme was launched across Japan by the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee in April 2017.

In Delhi, the Prakriti Metro Park near the Shastri Park Metro station is another example of how junk, including e-waste, can be recycled and put to good use. The park features 12 sculptures made from 20-25 tonnes of waste by artists from across India.

Back at the old Seelampur market, not far from the Prakriti Metro park, Owais and three other workers have managed to sift through the heap of smartphone motherboards by the end of our conversation. “The ones that are intact will be used again. These ones (he points towards the gunny sack) will be sold to the scrap dealers,"" says Owais.

One of the workers places the sack on a weighing machine. They have gathered around 3.5kg of electronic waste. Owais is done for now. He cleans his hands and pulls his Android smartphone out of a pocket to check some WhatsApp messages as he waits for the next lot of e-waste to arrive.",United States,2019.03
383,The Future of Global Recycling Lives in the Circular Economy,"Recently, the world celebrated Global Recycling Day, our annual reminder that the way we’re living can’t be sustained indefinitely, unless we embrace a new path to national and international resource efficiency.

 

 The theme of Global Recycling Day 2019 was “Recycling into the Future,” with an eye to encouraging countries around the world to look toward the future impact young people and technological advancements can have on our worldwide recycling efforts. China’s decision to ban the import of several categories of recyclable waste, as well as India’s more looming decision to possibly ban plastic imports, means these recycling efforts are needed now more than ever.

 

 The number one complaint I hear on an almost daily basis when it comes to recycling and sustainability is from people who, through no fault of their own, struggle to know what to recycle. Does their city allow mixed recyclables, or must they recycle by category? Must they clean everything they recycle, or can they get away with not fully rinsing out their milk cartons and yogurt pots? And what’s the deal, they ask, with differentiating between hard and soft plastics?

 

 We all want to be good global citizens, we really do. But it often feels that the path to getting there is an uphill struggle.

The circular economy looks to prevent depletion of finite natural resources out of the global economy in order to better use the natural resources we’ve already extracted to extend their useful lives. Recycling is the gateway to greater sustainability in the circular economy. It encompasses both upcycling, whereby a material is repurposed into something of higher value or function, such as turning used plastic into fiber for clothing; and downcycling, whereby a material is repurposed into something of lower value, or it is returned to its component parts, such as taking used cardboard and making it into a new cardboard box.

 

 The circular economy compels us to rethink our standard ideas around how consumption works. The typical way consumption is thought of is we take finite natural resources, we use them to create a product, then we throw said product away after we’re done with it. When you add recycling into the mix, this equation starts to sound more forgiving, but it’s still not living up to its full potential.

 

 While learning how your city recycles in order to reduce food contamination and maximize the productive afterlife of anything you place in your green or blue bins is a worthy use of your time, an even better use is to rethink conventional ideas surrounding consumption. Recycling is the foundational process of the circular economy. When we evaluate our purchases with greater scrutiny, or we reward companies that take a sustainable approach to business (and we encourage those that don’t to change their ways), we are rethinking our relationship with our future waste.

The future of the circular economy is bright. With technology innovating in this space at an ever-increasing rate, the way we think about waste and recycling is about to change.

385,Are you ready for Round 3 of the plastic waste trade war? | Greenbiz,"The heady mix of plastic waste, global damage and national interest already has sparked two sparring matches, and another is set to begin. At the heart of the issues is that much of the planet relies heavily on global trade, exporting and importing what we value. The trading of plastic waste is one example, although the exported value can come with a toxic cost. Finding the value in circular economy trading can help negate the need for some of these plastic waste trade wars.

The increased inability to easily move commodities, which plastic resources are if they are processed correctly, is part of the reason for the world’s plastic pollution problem. The other significant issue is the lack of local capacity for proper collection, sorting and basic processing for material recovery, across communities of all levels of economic advancement, including Hong Kong and Singapore, two of the world’s wealthiest cities.

In Round 1 of the plastic pollution fight, China announced its intention to cease the acceptance of scrap plastic imports in early 2017. Western industry insiders said, ""It would never happen."" They trusted market forces, expecting that such a ban would be viewed as an economic trade barrier.

This was a grave miscalculation, for as we now know, China’s application to the World Trade Organization also opened the door to human and environmental damage. This created the need to manage and limit the importation of plastic waste, where up to 40 percent of a bale shipped to China was unrecoverable, due to contamination and poor-quality material.

In 2018, China formalized its plan and ceased importing a number of materials for recycling, including all unprocessed plastic, leaving plastic exporting nations with enormous volumes of waste on their own front doors, and declaring a ""plastic waste crisis.""

China’s border closure was the modern day ""shot heard ‘round the world"" in terms of Western countries and their abilities to easily offshore their domestic plastic waste. Lack of homegrown capacities and high labor costs helped to shut the door on value-adding opportunities for many developed markets, while commodity traders often grabbed the resources from domestic processors, as the buyers in China paid more for lower-quality material.

With China’s borders closed, Round 2 of the plastic challenge resulted in Western countries turning quickly to find new export markets. Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia became the targets. Joining legitimate and responsible processors of these resources was a groundswell of illegal and irresponsible businesses. Like China, these countries felt, and feared, the harsh impacts of importing poor-quality, contaminated plastics. Their relatively quick actions to slow plastic imports for recycling, following China’s lead, means that most exporters did not find quick sustainable solutions for re-routing their previously China-bound exports.

Round 3 is on the way, as diplomats have been considering a proposal to add mixed plastic waste to a list of materials that require the receipt of a country's informed acceptance of this type of trade under the Basel Convention. If successful, trading mixed plastic waste resources will change from being business-led buying and selling to one of government determination. Plastic waste exporting countries will need the informed consent from recipient countries (such as Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia or China) in order for importation to be approved.

The problem, in short, is shifting to one of sustainable trade.

These topics were among those addressed across the world recently, both in Nairobi at the United Nations Environmental Assembly and at Plasticity Pacific in Fiji. Cutting across the localized need for solutions include the macro questions of whether recycling is really about sustainability, or is it a means for richer nations to shift a problem to poorer ones?

Today, the trade of waste plastic hides under the banner of doing environmental good at home without having to consider the impacts on recipient nations.

With the high publicity and visibility of plastic waste issues today, we all face much tougher questions than trying to decide which recycling bin to use for which type of material. We need plastic to maintain our modern lifestyles (think mobile phones, credit cards, auto parts and medical equipment). And the original concept behind recycling is still valid: to continually reuse materials for the ongoing benefit of all.

However, the mechanics of recycling are trapped in the industrial age where production is optimized with little thought for future consequence, while waste recovery facilities are mainly outdated, built primarily for recycling paper, glass and metal.

Far from shunning the complexity of the issues, many businesses recognize the implications of pleading ignorance, and instead have committed to being leaders in the solution, even if that solution is yet to be defined. Recycling for resource reuse is of paramount importance. Given no single company or nation possibly can reuse all resources that they consume, trade is essential. Trade, however, needs to be responsible, and it needs to be the trading of resources that will be completely used and managed.

The challenge we face is not whether plastic waste resources should be moved between countries for economies of scale and reuse. Instead, it is the question of how do we shift from thought to action, from principle to practical and from me to we.

Over the past eight years, we have held the Plasticity Forum around the world on the topic of plastic circular economies. We have engaged thousands of people from all parts of the value chain for industry-led, fit-for-purpose solutions.

From this diverse and deep exploration, we offer some thoughts on solving the key question: How do we optimize value for plastic in its second life, with localized processing, while allowing the transfer of materials only if needed for creating economies of scale from smaller markets to larger ones, and transferring only value, instead of burden (waste).

1. Continue the pressure: With the disruptive forces already in play, those countries that have been a dumping ground should continue the pressure on waste-exporting nations so that only recovered plastic feedstock is exported. In other words, only high-quality, fit-for-purpose material that has a second life in the recipient country.

2. Business focus on sustainable market opportunities: One Plasticity alumnus recently said that despite that his business collects used materials, processes it, then manufactures new goods for sale, his business is not that of a recycler. Rather, his business is a plastics engineering, design and product manufacturer that happens to specialize in using recovered plastic.

Like many entrepreneurs in this space, he starts with his customers, combining their needs with his strategic strengths to determine which profitable products to make and sell within the specialty market he serves (in this case, agricultural and aquaculture products where there is good market turnover and margin for profit). It is only after this analysis that he turns his mind to where he can source suitable waste plastic, its costs and the processes needed to transform it. Interestingly, he found that his customers are a great source of the very waste plastic he needs.

3. Collaborating for competitive advantage: The market disruption currently experienced globally is an opportunity for industries, countries and regions to apply this thinking from above. Each group knows its manufacturing strengths and weaknesses, and where it has strategic opportunity.

The only part missing is determining where there are viable opportunities to replace virgin plastic with recovered plastic, in order to ensure clear pathways for plastic waste to be transformed into feedstock for re-use.

4. Walking the talk: Governments and businesses wield huge buying power through their own procurement. Adopting policies favoring recovered content is a powerful demand catalyst to stimulate product development using recovered plastic.

5. Extract value from all plastic: Some plastics (such as clean, clear PET) are highly valuable as recovered plastic, yet many, either through lack of volume or high contamination, are perceived as worthless.

In sum, it is obvious that extracting valuable used plastic resources through collection, sorting and processing should take priority over downcycling the materials. Yet the greater challenge is what to do with the rest — the dirty mixed plastics where it is hard to derive value.

These materials can be converted from waste to energy, but increasingly entrepreneurs, scientists and researchers are looking beyond the calorific value to use dirty plastic’s embedded characteristics — for example, extracting the aluminium from chip packets and using a processed form to create a higher-performing building aggregate. Chemical recycling is also a growing opportunity that can yield a pure, high-quality polymer as a by-product, without the contamination burdens which some mechanical recycling processes need to contend with.

This is a growing field of innovation that can be turned in business, industry and country level competitive advantage.

6. Innovative substitutes for non-recoverable hazardous plastics: There are more than 43,000 types and combinations of plastics. While all are technically able to be recovered and reused, it is simply not viable to do so for many of them, given today’s technologies and economies of scale in sorting and collection. Where there is no value, and not even recoverable energy, the innovation challenge should be set globally to identify substitutes or recovery solutions. Over time, the ""too-hard basket"" of plastics will diminish.

7. Engage in the conversation: It is easy to want to blame someone for the global plastic waste problem: Should governments have done more? Are community attitudes the cause? Are corporates the ones at fault? The problem with the blame game is that once started, the finger-pointing rarely ends.

Above all else, new collaborations and shared responsibility that can be created across business sectors can help shift thought to action, embed principle to practice and help to change the focus — from me to we.

388,European Parliament approves 2021 single-use plastics ban,"
• The European Parliament recently voted 560-35 to approve a new law banning a variety of single-use plastic items across the European Union (EU) by 2021. The ban covers about a dozen items, including plastic cutlery, plates, straws, stirrers, balloon sticks, cotton swab sticks, and expanded polystyrene foam food and drink containers.
• All banned products will need to be manufactured from ""sustainable"" alternative materials – which doesn't include oxo-degradable items – once the ban takes effect. European Union countries will be required to reach a 90% collection goal for plastic bottles by 2029, and plastic bottles will need to contain 25% recycled content by 2025 and 30% by 2030.
• The law will also strengthen extended producer responsibility (EPR) for fishing gear and tobacco products, so that manufacturers have to bear the cost of collecting stray nets and cleaning up cigarette butts, respectively.

If this latest advancement receives necessary approval from the European Council of Ministers, the policy could become a major new circular economy model for other countries to follow. The move, as laid out in the policy's introduction, isn't meant to eradicate plastics entirely, but rather to keep its exponential growth in check:

""The high functionality and relatively low cost of plastic means that this material is increasingly ubiquitous in everyday life. While plastic plays a useful role in the economy and provides essential applications in many sectors, its growing use in short-lived applications, which are not designed for re-use or cost-effective recycling, means that related production and consumption patterns have become increasingly inefficient and linear.""

The ban's main objective is preventing plastic litter from ending up in waterways, which has been estimated to cost the European Union economy more than €259 million ($290 million USD) each year. According to the European Commission, 80% of marine litter is plastic, and items included in the new ban make up 70% of all marine litter.

In addition to the material ban and EPR, the measure calls for stronger labeling on certain products — including cigarettes with plastic filters, plastic cups, wet wipes and feminine napkins — to convey their harm to the environment and list proper disposal instructions.

While the EU is considered more advanced than the United States on a number of environmental topics, including EPR for packaging, it might still have trouble getting all member states on board with the new mandates. Last fall, the European Commission released a report revealing that half of EU member countries are in danger of missing their 2020 recycling targets. Upping plastic bottle collection requirements under the new law may not seem feasible to countries already struggling to meet existing mandates.

Still, public support for reducing ocean plastic is quite high — and still growing. Images of single-use plastic heaps on beaches and plastic debris harming wildlife — including a dead whale recently found with 88 pounds of plastic in its stomach — continue to fuel consumer desire for more sustainable products and packaging.",United States,2019.03

394,European Parliament bans certain single-use plastics,"Legislative body cites plastic in oceans in creating new rules; critics worry policy will be unevenly applied in different nations.

The European Parliament has agreed on measures put forward by the European Commission to address marine litter coming from the 10 single-use plastic products cited as having been most often found on European beaches.

The rules on single-use plastic items are part of a wider EU Plastics Strategy, which the EU calls “the most comprehensive strategy in the world adopting a material-specific life cycle approach with the vision and objectives to have all plastic packaging placed on the EU market as reusable or recyclable [as possible] by 2030.”

“Today, we have taken an important step to reduce littering and plastic pollution in our oceans and seas,” states Frans Timmermans, the EP’s first vice president, responsible for sustainable development. “We got this, we can do this. Europe is setting new and ambitious standards, paving the way for the rest of the world.”

The banned items reportedly include plastic plates, balloon sticks, and food and beverage containers made of expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam.

Some European trade associations have raised questions about the policy’s details. Brussels-based Europen, whose members create and sell packaged products, says it “supports the EU’s overarching objectives of taking bold action against litter and marine litter in particular,” also says it is calling on the European Commission and member states “to clarify without delay the provisions in legislation that remain ambiguous, in order to ensure unified implementation across Europe.”

Europen adds that the new legislation does not insist on a “harmonized approach, presenting a serious risk [it] will allow member states to adopt unilateral bans on specific packaging applications to reduce consumption of certain items which remain poorly defined in legislation.”

Adds the group, “Therefore, there is a risk that different national interpretations will impede the internal market. We call on EU policymakers to develop evidence-based implementation guidance on the unclear terms without delay.”

“Looking ahead, our collective priority must now be to ensure as much uniformity as possible in the implementation of the SUP and resolve these legal uncertainties resulting from an unprecedentedly rushed legislative procedure,” states Hans van Bochove of Coca-Cola European Partners and Europen’s chairman.

Adds van Bochove, “The packaging value chain is committed to innovating for sustainability. This will require investments at scale. For this to happen, business needs clarity on the applicable rules and a coherent, long-term and stable EU policy framework. One single EU Circular Economy is preferable to 28 or 27 different ones.”

The Brussels-based European Plastic Converters (EuPC) association is more directly critical of the policy. “We regret the adoption of such a regulatory act, discriminating a material that has a crucial role in solving the current challenges for society globally in the decades to come,” states Alexandre Dangis, the EuPC’s managing director.

Continues Dangis, “This vote will have a direct negative environmental impact and thousands of job losses all over Europe. It furthermore dictates countries and people how to live and change consumption habits without focusing on what’s key, namely education and anti-littering behavior. Littering will continue but with other products. Regrettably, no proper impact assessment or [life cycle analyses] have been done within the extraordinary short timeframe, as EU politicians carried on the wave of fighting for a so-called good cause.“",United States,2019.03
395,This project is turning abandoned fishing gear into volleyball nets,"This article is brought to you thanks to the collaboration of The European Sting with the World Economic Forum. A team of environmentalists is turning “ghost nets” into sports nets, giving new life to abandoned fishing gear adrift in the world’s oceans. The organisation responsible for world volleyball (FIVB) has teamed up with marine conservation group the Ghost Fishing Foundation to launch Good Net. Supported by collaborators like the Healthy Seas initiative, World Animal Protection and Greenpeace, the project is designed to rid the seas of discarded fishing nets, with many becoming recycled into volleyball nets for local community use around the world. According to United Nations figures, up to 800,000 metric tons of discarded, abandoned or lost fishing nets go adrift in our oceans each year.

Ghost nets are often lost during storms or in strong currents and can drift for many months, even years, entangling fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Drifting fishing gear can travel great distances and can continue to fish long after it has been abandoned. It’s a problem that doesn’t recognise international territorial waters or distinguish between the types of species that become ensnared.

Some discarded nets become snagged on reefs, choking the coral and killing marine life. Others drift with the ocean current into open water, where they trap fish, turtles and larger mammals like dolphins, seals and whales. In US coastal waters alone, there were 76 large whale entanglements reported in 2017. Laden with dead marine life, the nets eventually sink to the ocean floor where scavengers feed on the entangled carcasses. After being freed of their ballast, the abandoned nets rise to the surface and resume fishing. Net impact

 

 Human intervention in removing the nets from our oceans breaks this destructive cycle. And because most modern nets are made of durable synthetic fibres, they can be broken down into nylon yarn, which can be used for any number of new applications. Some of the nets are repaired using traditional techniques and are turned into volleyball nets for local communities to enjoy. With the circular economy at work in this way, the once hazardous nets play a small part in helping sustainability efforts.

The first sporting event using recycled nets took place on Brazil’s famous Copacabana beach, which was also the setting for the 2016 Rio Olympic Games’ beach volleyball tournament. This was the first of a series of FIVB-endorsed volleyball matches planned for different venues around the globe, which aim to raise awareness of the damage caused to marine life and habitats by abandoned fishing gear.

“When there is a large amount of fishing gear out there, it affects fishermen’s bottom lines, it affects the future sustainability of otherwise harvestable catch, and often it prevents fishermen from spending more time on the water,” he states.",United States,2019.03
399,Are circular economies the answer? –,"Throughout the 20th century the prevailing assumption was that the solution to pollution is economic growth. The trajectories followed by many developed nations – from widespread poverty through heavily-polluting industrialization to clean technology and good standards of living – support this simplistic relationship. But recent decades have revealed that matters aren’t this straightforward. Now a study has reviewed the links between pollution and economic development and investigates ways to transition towards a more sustainable economy.

Between 1970 and 2006, GDP in the US, adjusted for inflation, grew by 195%. The number of cars and trucks in the country doubled and the total number of miles driven grew by 178%. In theory air pollution should have skyrocketed. Technological innovations and new regulations, however, led to significant decreases in emissions of carbon monoxide (by 37%), nitrogen oxides (30%), sulphur dioxide (52%), particulates (80%) and lead (98%).

This is a classic example of the inverted-U-shaped environmental Kuznets curve. It suggests that economic development initially leads to environmental degradation but once average income reaches a certain point, the curve undergoes a turning point and the environment improves as wages rise further.

The environmental Kuznets curve is a compelling hypothesis but there are lots of exceptions to the rule. Take deforestation. On paper many developed countries have their tree-felling under control and back to sustainable levels. More often the reality is that imports increase, exporting the deforestation elsewhere.

To understand the connections between the environment and economic development in more depth, Saleem Ali from the University of Delaware, US, and Jose Puppim de Oliveira from the São Paulo and Brazilian School of Public and Business Administration, Brazil reviewed six fundamental models.

Recent studies have revealed flaws in the environmental Kuznets curve. Rather than being shaped like an upside-down U, it more commonly has an upward flick at the end that represents the renewed rise of pollution once the easiest pollution challenges have been tackled.

“The key take-home message is that there is no generic environmental Kuznets curve which can be used for policy-making,” says Ali, “and therefore pollution policy is better determined by monitoring and enforcement of standards that are based on the environmental and social impact of pollution.”

Sometimes technology enables countries to “tunnel through” the environmental Kuznets curve, avoiding the environmental degradation associated with the first phase of economic development. The paper industry, for example, traditionally relied on mercury for electrolysis but now tends to use a membrane cell process. As a result, many developing countries can avoid the burden of mercury pollution associated with mass paper production.

If we really want to achieve sustainability, the research suggests we should strive for a “circular economy”.

“A circular economy requires us to mimic biological cycles in terms of reusing waste materials from industrial processes,” says Ali. “It is compatible with economic growth but focuses on reused, re-manufacturerd and recycled material rather than virgin materials.”

Such an economy would need policies that make waste more economically useful and a redesign of manufacturing processes. Finland has taken a leading role in driving its economy towards a circular structure but there are potential negative consequences. In particular, as systems become more resource-efficient, prices start to drop, which can cause a “rebound effect” as people consume more.

“The increased consumption could lead to environmental concerns such as increased greenhouse gas emissions,” says Ali.

There are ways to improve human well-being, achieve sustainable development goals and have a healthy economy but the research to date suggests that keeping a circular economy on track needs constant evaluation and refinement.

Ali and Oliveira reported their review in Environmental Research Letters (ERL).",United States,2019.03
400,Circular economy a topic at International Automobile Recycling Congress,"Big River Steel (BRS), Osceola, Arkansas, is expanding production capacity at its steel mill, which produces tube grade sheet for pipeline construction, silicon steels for a wide variety of energy and electric motor applications and high-strength steels for the U.S. automotive industry. The company has commissioned SMS Group, Germany, to supply mechanical equipment, electrical and automation systems and digitalization for the project. The expansion will increase the plant’s annual output to about 3 million tons.

After the expansion is completed, BRS will have two electric arc furnaces (EAF) and two twin-ladle furnaces. Installation of an additional gas cleaning system will ensure compliance with strict environmental legislation, SMS Group says in the news release announcing the expansion project. A second strand, a second tunnel furnace a further will be added to the CSP continuous strip plant.

Big River Steel’s CSP plant produces up to 76-inch-wide coils, making it one of the widest CSP plants in the world. The hot coil produced in the CSP plant is processed into cold strip in the downstream coupled pickling line/tandem cold mill. As part of this project, the continuous galvanizing line (CGL) will receive an additional coiler. For all the newly installed plants, SMS Group is going to supply the mechanical equipment and the X-Pact electrical and automation systems, including level 3, the company says.

During this construction stage, the PQA (Product Quality Analyzer) system developed by SMS Group company MET/Con will be installed as a central module of the process automation system. By capturing and evaluating relevant production data on a continuous basis, PQA monitors, documents and assures the product quality down to the finished cold strip along the complete production process, SMS Group says. The system uses stored rules to assess the coil quality in a semiautomatic procedure and, based on these assessments, takes “ship” or “block” decisions for the downstream processing of the strip or its dispatch. The system sends instructions for action to the operators to make them aware of any onset of irregularities within the production process and suggest countermeasures to be taken.

The expansion project is rounded out by SMS Group’s technical service, which includes spare part management services.

David Stickler, BRS CEO, says, “I have purchased several technologically advanced steel production facilities from SMS over the past 20 years and I am fully confident that SMS group will again deliver a high-quality mill that sets the standard in terms of product capability, energy efficiency and environmental sustainability.”

Burkhard Dahmen, chairman of the managing board of SMS group, says, “Working closely with the management and staff of Big River Steel, we have succeeded in digitalizing a highly complex steel plant in a way that meets the targets of stable and resource-saving production. We are very pleased about Big River Steel’s decision to also award us the order for the next expansion stage of the steel plant and to continue on the proven successful way with SMS Group as their partner.”",United States,2019.03
401,Life-cycle assessments must better align with circularity | Greenbiz,"We’ve been doing a lot of work and thinking about life-cycle assessment (LCA) and its relationship to the concept of the circular economy.

When I heard Tom Szaky, founder of recycling innovator TerraCycle, talk about his company’s initiatives to eliminate the concept of waste, I asked him about the use of LCA to analyze what they were doing. He was of the opinion that LCA wasn’t the right tool to assess the circular economy.

Previously, I had asked a longtime practitioner about a situation where the use of a recycled material required far less energy than virgin material. In a case like that, shouldn’t there be added incentive for users to recycle? His response was that if landfilling had fewer impacts than the recycling process, they should just landfill the product.

These are just two examples of how current LCA practice and circular economy principles appear to be at odds with one another. But LCA is the best tool we’ve got for analyzing environmental impacts of recycling systems. So, is the circular economy not as good as we think? Do we need a different tool? Or does LCA need to evolve?

Some colleagues and I have been sharing ideas to see if there might be a better way to look at recycling and reuse. Currently, when a typical LCA deals with end-of-life landfill, the analysis is simple: We just add the landfill process, including the required activities of transport and waste burial, and any leachate that may occur. But when we deal with reuse or recycling, we consider the benefit of such actions and account for ""avoided burden.""

How come we tend to look at the implications of one end-of-life action but not others? What if we change the default perspective to reuse, and see that the effects of landfilling, just like recycling, go beyond the direct activities?

Landfill is actually a driver for more virgin product because it removes from circulation material that could have been recycled and put back into the circular stream. We’re working on a method that will flesh that out more fully.

In the meantime, we put on our systems-thinking caps to consider the circular economy more carefully.

By including both the initial product and the product made from recycled material in our functional unit, we can bring the process into better alignment with circular economy thinking. LCA uses lots of tricks to allow us to consider two product lives in one — either benefitting the first life with a credit or the second life with not needing to use virgin material. But rarely is there a significant benefit to both lives.

In reality, when a product is recycled, there are actually two products being produced at different times. Our functional unit is no longer ""one of product V"" (made of virgin material) but ""one of product V and one of product R"" (made with recycled material). If product V isn’t recycled, product R becomes another product V by default. We can then look at this more complete system to understand which is better.



Figure 1 (above) shows the case where Product V is recycled after being supplied at Time 1. Perhaps the ideal case of reuse is my grandmother’s cast iron frying pan, which already has lasted two generations and could endure for five more. For that skillet, the ""recycling"" process would be a thorough cleaning and the manufacturing process could be skipped.



Figure 2 (above) shows what happens if Product V supplied at Time 1 is landfilled instead of being recycled. It is clear that there is both a landfill step and a need to obtain virgin material to create the product to be supplied at time 2.

Requiring both products to be included in a single model eliminates the need to split the impacts between them, and clearly shows the change in system-wide impacts. At the same time, it requires a manufacturer to understand the impacts of its products beyond placement in the recycle bin. Is the product really recycled? What is Product R? Is Product R really equivalent to the Product V it replaces?

The goal of circular economy concepts is to help us make the world a better place. Fulfilling that aspiration will require assessment methods that can distinguish good circular economy ideas from bad ones — to answer, for example, the question of whether recycling a particular product in a particular way is actually beneficial.

LCA is a potentially good tool for that but, to date, it has been providing mixed messages. By including both the initial product and the product made from recycled material in our functional unit, we can bring the process into better alignment with circular economy thinking and gain a clearer picture of what’s really happening.

We’re not quite finished with all of this work and thinking. So if you have ideas or a project you want us to work on, please contact us.",United States,2019.03
402,Solving the e-waste challenge requires global action,"An international team of experts have highlighted the urgent need for global cooperation to reform the e-waste recycling industry and counteract the harm it poses to both human health and environment.

Old mobile phones, computers, and circuit boards are all examples of electronic waste or e-waste.

E-waste often contains toxic components and is a major problem on the world stage. Even more concerning is the alarming rate at which e-waste is growing with almost 45 million metric tonnes recorded in 2016.

Huge volumes of e-waste are shipped around the world illegally or sent for processing to countries with underdeveloped and unsafe recycling capabilities. These practices pose a significant risk to human health and the environment.

The collaborative study, which involves Professor Lenny Koh from the University of Sheffield's Management School and a team of researchers from the USA and China, is published in Nature Electronics.

The authors of the paper aim to transform today's rudimentary recycling practices so that they become advanced, safe, and a profitable part of the global circular economy – an economic model where we extract the maximum use from a produce before it is recycled entirely or valuable parts are salvaged for future use.

Professor Koh, who is the Director for the Centre of Energy, Environment and Sustainability, and Director of the Advanced Resource Efficiency Centre, said: ""E-waste can be turned into 'gold' and can contribute to the circular economy if it is handled effectively, efficiently and sustainably, thereby avoiding negative impacts on health and the environment.""

Advanced equipment used to manage e-waste recycling such as Apple's iPhone recycling robot ""Daisy' is expensive and unable to deal with the sheer volume of waste material.

Current preventative measures such as the United Nations' Basel Convention are unable to cope with the rapidly increasing quantity of hazardous waste.

However, the international team of experts which includes Professor Oladele Ogunseitan from the University of California, USA, and Professor Jinhui Li and Dr. Abhishek Awasthi from Tsinghua University, China, have developed recommendations to help alleviate the global challenge.

The researchers are calling for international cooperation and engagement from the private sector to tackle the pressing issue urging the best available technologies to be shared internationally and scaled up to deal not only with the e-waste mountain, but also with the safety issues around labour practises in this nascent industry.

The study also highlights standards in the e-waste industry which need to be improved. Profit margins for recyclers can be so small that they resort to using unsafe and environmentally damaging practices to meet demand. The researchers flag the need for oversight from governmental agencies to advance e-waste collection and strengthen recycling infrastructure.

Furthermore, financial incentives for this industry should be introduced. The academics point to an example of good practice where Indian banks have provided capital to promote sustainable development in rural regions which supports particular industries.

The researchers argue that this model can be applied to the e-waste industry to establish self-help group parks or cooperatives under the umbrella of the environmental regulatory authority of a country. This strategy aims to professionalise the industry, develop workers' skills, and sure up safe labour practises across countries.

Professor Koh added: ""Accessible best available technologies, sustainable standards for e-waste recycling, and financial incentives will pave the way forward for global actions in solving the e-waste challenge. Our research and recommendations shown in this paper can be used directly by governments and industry globally in designing e-waste recovery and circular economy models and policy.""

405,"Growthism: its Ecological, Economic and Ethical Limits","We have many problems – poverty, unemployment, environmental destruction, climate change, financial instability, etc. – but only one solution for everything, namely economic growth. We believe that growth is the costless, win-win solution to all problems, or at least the necessary precondition for any solution. This is growthism. It now creates more problems than it solves.

A journey of no return, not a circular economy

The economic process is not a mechanical analog that can be run forward and backward, nor a circular process that can return to any previous state. Rather it is an irreversible and irrevocable process moving in the direction of time’s arrow of increasing entropy.[1]Finitude and entropy guarantee that the economic life of our species will be a journey of no return. Therefore even a stationary economy, in the classical sense of constant population and constant capital stock, is ultimately a journey of no return, because the metabolic throughput of matter and energy required to maintain constant stocks of people and physical capital, in the face of depreciation and death, is an entropic flow from ever less concentrated sources to ever filling sinks – and both sources and sinks are finite. Consequently, technology must change qualitatively to adapt to entropy increase, to depletion and pollution of the environment, even in the stationary, or “steady-state economy” as it has been more recently called. Relative to the growth economy the steady-state economy is a slower journey of no return, one that values longevity with sufficiency, and seeks qualitative improvement rather than quantitative increase. The many advantages of a slower journey were emphasized by John Stuart Mill, the champion of the classical stationary state:[2]

In contrast to Mill’s vision of the steady state, the reality of today’s growthist economy is one of harried drivenness, of frantic adaptation to the unforeseen, unwilled, and out of control consequences of maximized, subsidized growth, pushed by ever larger scale and more dangerous technologies. Such growth is now threatening the capacity of earth to support life.

Many are not content with a slower more careful journey of no return. They want a so-called “circular economy” that can presumably live, and continue to grow, by ingesting only its own waste products. They assume that what they consider desirable must therefore be possible.

For anyone who has taken the first course in economics the recently revived term “circular economy” calls to mind the famous diagram of the circular flow of exchange value between firms and households found in the first pages of the standard textbooks. That diagram shows goods and factors of production flowing in a closed circle between firms and households with money flowing in the opposite direction. The economy is represented as an isolated system – nothing enters from the outside, nothing exits to the outside. There are no natural resources entering from the ecosphere, no wastes exiting back to the ecosphere. Indeed there is no ecosphere, no containing and constraining environment of any kind. This abstract vision is useful for studying exchange (supply, demand, prices, and national income), but worthless for studying environmental costs of economic growth because there is no finite environment to constrain growth.

This picture however is not what most advocates today mean by “circular economy”, but it has a similar name of long standing, and is a source of confusion. By “circular economy” they mean an economy that recycles material natural resources to a high degree, and increases product lifetimes, and uses mainly renewable resources – all good policies, but destined to fall short of their goal of “sustainable growth”. It might better have been called a “recycling economy” or an economy that maximizes natural resource productivity rather than labor or capital productivity. Increased resource efficiency is also referred to as “decoupling” as in disconnecting the output of goods and services from the throughput of resources. In the limit a totally “decoupled economy” would take us back to the neo-classical circular flow representation of the economy as an isolated system. For this reason I prefer to avoid this reborn notion of “circular economy,” and the related term “decoupling” because” they greatly overstate the degree of separability of production from resource throughput, further encouraging the unrealistic quest for “sustainable growth” in physical scale of the economic subsystem relative to the biosphere.

The heavy emphasis on circularity casts a deep shadow over the more basic fact that the metabolic throughput is fundamentally a linear one-way entropic flow. Yes, the overall linear flow can contain important countercurrents and reverse eddies of recycling, and it is important to take advantage of that. But the river itself flows from the mountains to the sea, and never backwards. True, the hydrologic cycle powered by the sun, can evaporate the water to rain again in the mountains, but that happens in the ecosphere, outside the economy. If the “circular economy” relies on natural biophysical cycles powered by the sun, and does not grow in scale beyond the regenerative and absorptive capacities of the containing biosphere, then it approximates a steady-state economy – not a sustainable growth economy. In addition to a circulatory subsystem (recognized since the Physiocrats’ analogy with blood circulation) the economy also has a digestive tract that ties it to its environment at both ends. That second more basic metabolic analogy has been neglected in economic theory.

Recycling is limited, first because it costs energy to carry out the recycle of materials; and second because energy itself is not subject to recycling (entropy means that it always takes more energy to effect the recycle than the amount of energy recycled – regardless of the price of energy!). The extra energy for the recycling also requires material instruments, trucks etc. So materials can be reduced, but at the cost of an increase in energy (and material) throughput, which after some number of cycles (how many?) becomes prohibitive, as remaining materials are ever more dispersed. Even expensive metals like gold, silver, and copper are currently only about one-third recycled and two-thirds newly depleted. Writers who expound the circular economy seem to be aware of this fact, but do not give it sufficient emphasis. Also it is important to distinguish prompt materials recycling that is internal to the economic subsystem, from long run external recycling through the containing ecosphere. While increased reliance on renewable resources is a good feature of the “circular economy”, one must remember that, when exploited beyond sustainable yield, renewable resources effectively become nonrenewable. There is always a scale limit to a sustainable economic subsystem, beyond which growth, even in a “circular” economy, breaks down and sustainability requires a steady-state economy.

The basic issue of limits to growth that the Club of Rome did so much to emphasize in the early 1970s needs to remain front and center, with recycling considered as a useful accommodation to that limit, but not a path by which the growth economy can continue. Well before becoming physically impossible the growth of the economic subsystem becomes uneconomic in the sense that it costs more in terms of sacrificed ecosystem services than it is worth in terms of extra production. That richer is better than poorer is a truism. No dispute there. But is growth in GDP in wealthy countries really making us richer by any inclusive measure of wealth? That is the question. I think it is likely making us poorer by increasing unmeasured “illth” faster than measured wealth. Even a steady-state economy can be too big relative to the ecosphere. The neoclassical circular flow picture can never be too big by virtue of its being an isolated system. However, neoclassical economists do recognize that the economy can grow too fast (over-allocation of resources to investment relative to consumption), even though its scale can never be too big.

Inevitably national growth economies reach a point where many citizens begin to suspect that growth is no longer worth the cost of excessively rapid adaptation to an accelerating economy of no return – that so-called economic growth has in reality become uneconomic growth. John Stuart Mill recognized that long ago. Why have not more recognized it? Why is growth still the summum bonum of economists and politicians? Probably because growth is our substitute for sharing as a cure for poverty. And because our national accounts (GDP) are incapable of even registering uneconomic growth because they count only value added by labor and capital, and omit entirely the cost of using up that to which value is added, namely the entropic flow of natural resources, the very sap of life and wealth.

Globalization as an extension of growthism

Those of us old enough to remember the Cold War know that it was basically a contest between Socialism and Capitalism to see who could grow faster, and thereby accumulate more wealth and military power. The audience was the uncommitted countries of the world who would supposedly adopt the economic system of the winner of the growth race. What happened? Basically, Socialism collapsed, and Capitalism won by default. The losers (Russia, China, Eastern Europe) got back in the growth race by adopting State Capitalism, and China has become the growth champion. The present system of world growthism, in the broadly capitalist mode, is triumphant. But growthism itself has turned out to be a false god because growth in our finite and entropic world now increases ecological and social costs faster than production benefits, making us poorer, not richer (except for the top few percent). Recognition of this reversal is obscured by the fact that our national accounts (GDP), do not subtract the costs of growth, but effectively add them by counting the expenditures incurred to defend ourselves from the un-subtracted costs of growth. Even more egregiously, GDP counts the consumption of natural capital as income. Growthism is consuming the life support capacity of the biosphere for the benefit of a small minority of the present generation, while shifting the real but uncounted costs on to the poor, future generations, and other species.[3]

As national economies confront limits to their growth aspirations imposed by the carrying capacity of their territory and the extent of their national markets, they strive, by globalization, to grow into the ecological and economic space of all other countries, as well as into the remaining global commons. While this certainly provides extra degrees of freedom for individual nations to continue growing for a while, it does not remove global limits. It simply ensures that those limits will be met more simultaneously and less sequentially. Consequently there will be less opportunity for one country to learn from the experience of others in adapting to limits.

Furthermore, the ability of nations to enact independent policies for coming to terms with limits is undercut, because the net result of globalization is to convert many difficult, but tractable, national problems into one simultaneous intractable global problem, by speeding up and generalizing the economic journey of no return. At the same time, however, increasing energy costs will raise the cost of transport which acts as a general tariff on international trade and will promote national and local production, thereby weakening somewhat long distance trade and globalization.

The key to understanding globalization, I believe, is to clearly distinguish it from internationalization:

Internationalization refers to the increasing importance of relations between nations: international trade, international treaties, alliances, protocols, etc. The basic unit of community and policy remains the nation, even as relations among nations, and among individuals in different nations, become increasingly necessary and important.

Globalization refers to global economic integration of many formerly national economies into one global economy, by free trade, especially by free capital mobility, and also more recently by easy or uncontrolled migration. Globalization is the effective erasure of national boundaries for economic purposes. National boundaries become totally porous with respect to goods and capital, and increasingly porous with respect to people, viewed in this context as cheap labor, or in some cases cheap human capital.

In sum, globalization is the economic integration of the globe. But exactly what is “integration”? The word derives from “integer”, meaning one, complete, or whole. Integration means much more than “interdependence” – it is the act of combining separate albeit related units into a single whole. Interdependence is to integration as friendship is to marriage. Since there can be only one whole, only one unity with reference to which parts are integrated, it follows that global economic integration logically implies national economic disintegration – parts are torn out of their national context (dis-integrated), presumably to be re-integrated into the new whole, the globalized economy. As the saying goes, to make an omelette you have to break some eggs. The disintegration of the national egg is necessary to integrate the global omelette. The benefits of global integration are extolled while the costs of national disintegration are neglected.

Of course globalization is far from complete, but the tendency is well advanced. What we have now is a collection of disintegrating national economies whose policies regarding international trade, capital mobility, and migration are taken over by monopoly global corporations, giant international banks, and a free-for-all of illegal migration of both cheap labor and human capital.

All that I have just said was expressed with admirable clarity, honesty, and brevity by Renato Ruggiero, former director-general of WTO: “We are no longer writing the rules of interaction among separate national economies. We are writing the constitution of a single global economy.”[4] This is a clear affirmation of globalization and rejection of internationalization as just defined. It is also a radical subversion of the Bretton Woods Charter. Internationalization is what the Bretton Woods Institutions were designed for, not globalization.

Everyone recognizes the desirability of community for the world as a whole– but we have two very different models of world community: (1) a federated community of real national communities (internationalization), versus (2) a cosmopolitan direct membership of individuals in a single global abstract community (globalization).

If the IMF-WB-WTO are no longer serving the interests of their member nations as per their charter, then whose interests are they serving? The interests of the integrated “global economy” we are told. But what concrete reality lies behind that grand abstraction? Not real individual workers, peasants, or small businessmen, but rather giant pseudo-individuals, the transnational corporations.

Consider a few pattern-changing consequences of globalization, of the erasure of national boundaries for economic purposes. Briefly, they include: (1) standards-lowering competition to externalize social and environmental costs to achieve a competitive price advantage–a race to the bottom in terms of both efficiency in cost accounting and equity in income distribution; (2) increased tolerance of mergers and monopoly power in domestic markets in order to be big enough to compete internationally; (3) more intense national (regional) specialization according to the dictates of competitive advantage, with the consequence of reducing the range of choice of ways to earn a livelihood, and increasing dependence on other countries. Free trade and intense specialization negate the freedom not to trade; (4) world-wide enforcement of a muddled and self-serving doctrine of “trade-related intellectual property rights” in direct contradiction to Thomas Jefferson’s dictum that “knowledge is the common property of mankind”. Let us look at each of these in a bit more detail.

The country that does the poorest job of internalizing all social and environmental costs of production into its prices gets a competitive advantage in international trade. More of world production shifts to countries that do the poorest job of counting costs – a sure recipe for reducing the efficiency of global production. As uncounted, externalized costs increase, the positive correlation between GDP growth and welfare disappears, or even becomes negative.

Another dimension of the race to the bottom is the increasing inequality in the distribution of income in high-wage countries, such as the US, fostered by globalization. In the US there has been an implicit social contract established to ameliorate industrial strife between labor and capital. Specifically, a just distribution of income between labor and capital has been taken to be one that is more equal within the US than it is for the world as a whole. Global integration of markets necessarily abrogates that social contract. US wages will fall drastically because labor is relatively much more abundant globally than nationally. It also means that returns to capital in the US will increase because capital is relatively scarcer globally than nationally. US distribution of income then tends to the more unequal global distribution, thus breaking the implicit social contract.

Free trade, and by extension globalization, is often defended by appeal to Ricardian comparative advantage. The logic of comparative advantage assumes that factors of production, especially capital, are immobile between nations. Only products are traded.[5]With capital mobility now the major defining feature of globalization we have left the world of comparative advantage and entered a regime of absolute advantage, which guarantees gains from trade to the world as a whole, but does not guarantee that each nation will share in those gains, as was the case under comparative advantage. Global gains under absolute advantage are theoretically greater than under comparative advantage, but there is no reason to expect these gains to be shared by all trading partners. Mutual gain could be restored under absolute advantage by redistributing some of the global gains from trade. But I have never heard that idea discussed by globalization advocates. Often they appeal, quite illogically, to the doctrine of comparative advantage as a guarantee of mutual benefit, conveniently forgetting that the logic of comparative advantage requires immobile capital, and that capital is not immobile.[6] Indeed, some even argue for free capital mobility by extension of the comparative advantage argument – if free trade in goods is mutually beneficial then why not also have free trade in capital? However, one cannot use the conclusion of an argument to abolish one of the premises upon which the argument is based! Similar illogical arguments are made in defense of free labor mobility between nations.

Fostering global competitive advantage is used as an excuse for tolerance of corporate mergers and monopoly in national markets so that domestic firms are big enough to compete globally (we now depend on international trade as a substitute for domestic trust busting to maintain competition). It is ironic that this is done in name of deregulation and the free market. Chicago School economist and Nobel laureate Ronald Coase said, “Firms are islands of central planning in a sea of market relationships”.[7] The islands of central planning become larger and larger relative to the remaining sea of market relationships as a result of merger. More and more resources are allocated by within-firm central planning, and less by between- firm market relationships. And this is hailed as a victory for markets! It is no such thing. It is a victory for corporations relative to national governments, which are no longer strong enough to regulate corporate capital and maintain competitive markets in the public interest. Of the 100 largest economic organizations roughly 52 are corporations and 48 are nations. Approximately one-third of the commerce that crosses national boundaries does not cross a corporate boundary, i.e. is an intra-firm, non-market transfer. The distribution of income within these centrally planned corporations has become much more concentrated. The ratio of salary of the Chief Executive Officer to low-level employees has passed 500 on its way to infinity–what else can we expect when central planners set their own salaries!

Free trade and free capital mobility increase pressures for specialization according to both comparative and absolute advantage. Therefore the range of choice of ways to earn a livelihood becomes greatly narrowed. In Uruguay, for example, everyone would have to be either a shepherd or a cowboy in conformity with the specialization dictated by competitive advantage in the global market. Everything else should be imported in exchange for beef, mutton, wool, and leather. Any Uruguayan who wants to play in a symphony orchestra or be an airline pilot should emigrate. Uruguayans have sensibly resisted such excessive specialization.

Most people derive as much satisfaction from how they earn their income as from how they spend it. Narrowing that range of choice is a welfare loss uncounted by trade theorists. Globalization assumes either that emigration and immigration are costless, or that narrowing the range of occupational choice within a nation is costless. Both assumptions are false.

While trade theorists ignore the range of choice in earning one’s income, the range of choice in spending one’s income receives exaggerated emphasis. For example, the US imports Danish butter cookies and Denmark imports US butter cookies. The cookies cross each other somewhere over the North Atlantic. Although the gains from trading such similar commodities cannot be great, trade theorists insist that expanding the range of consumer choice to the limit increases the welfare of cookie connoisseurs. Perhaps, but could not those gains be had more cheaply by simply trading recipes? One might think so, but recipes (trade related intellectual property rights) are the thing that free traders most want to protect.

Of all things, knowledge is that which should be most freely shared, because in sharing it is multiplied rather than divided. Knowledge is a non-rival good and should be also non excludable. Yet, as already noted, our trade theorists have rejected Thomas Jefferson’s dictum that “Knowledge is the common property of mankind” in exchange for a muddled doctrine of “trade related intellectual property rights” by which they are willing to grant private corporations monopoly ownership of the very basis of life itself–patents to seeds (including the patent-protecting, life-denying terminator gene) and to knowledge of basic genetic structures.

The argument offered to support this enclosure of the knowledge commons is that, unless we provide the economic incentive of monopoly ownership for a significant period of time, little new knowledge and innovation will be forthcoming. Yet, as far as I know, James Watson and Francis Crick, who discovered the structure of DNA, do not share in the patent royalties reaped by the second rate gene-jockeys who are profiting from their monumental discovery. Nor of course did Gregor Mendel get any royalties – but then he was a monk motivated by mere curiosity about how Creation works! Nor did Jonas Salk try to patent the polio vaccine. He thought it would be like trying to patent the sun.

Once knowledge exists, its proper allocative price is the marginal opportunity cost of sharing it, which is close to zero, since nothing is lost by sharing it. Yes, of course you do lose the monopoly on the knowledge, but then economists have traditionally argued that monopoly is inefficient as well as unjust because it creates an artificial scarcity of the monopolized item. Furthermore, the main input to the production of new knowledge is existing knowledge, and keeping the latter artificially expensive is bound to slow down the production of the former.

Of course the cost of production of new knowledge is not zero, even though the cost of sharing it is. This allows biotech corporations to claim that they deserve a fifteen or twenty year monopoly for the expenses they incur in research and development, even though they spend more on advertising than research. Of course they deserve a profit on their efforts, but not on Watson and Crick’s contribution without which they could do nothing, nor on the contributions of Gregor Mendel, and all the great scientists of the past who made the fundamental discoveries.[8] As economist Joseph Schumpeter emphasized, being the first with an innovation already gives one a temporary monopoly. In his view these recurring temporary monopolies were the source of profit in a competitive economy whose theoretical tendency is to compete excess profits down to zero.

As the great Swiss economist, Sismondi, argued long ago, not all new knowledge is a benefit to mankind. We need a social and ethical filter to select out the beneficial knowledge. Motivating the search for knowledge by the purpose of benefiting mankind rather than by securing monopoly profit provides a better filter. Perhaps the greatest virtue of the steady- state economy is that because it is a slow rather than a fast journey of no return, we would have time to evaluate and experiment with new technologies, rather than blindly accepting anything in order to keep growth from slowing.

This is not to say that we should abolish all intellectual property rights – that would create more problems than it would solve. But we should certainly begin restricting the domain and length of patent monopolies rather than increasing them so rapidly and recklessly. And we should become much more willing to share knowledge. Shared knowledge increases the productivity of all labor, capital, and resources. International development aid should consist far more of freely shared knowledge, and far less of foreign investment and interest-bearing loans.

John Maynard Keynes, one of the founders of the recently subverted Bretton Woods Institutions, recommended the following pattern for our international economy:

Growth-driven globalization will maximize economic entanglement between nations in pursuit of trading advantage, of monopoly power, of privatizing the remaining commons, especially that of knowledge, and of concentrating income to an extreme degree. These are the patterns that growthism solves for by way of globalization. Globalism is not the realization of world community. Rather it is individualism writ large – corporate feudalism in a global open-access commons.

On the importance of boundaries in life and logic

John Lennon asked us to imagine a world without boundaries, singing wistfully “imagine there’s no countries”, and we all know what he meant – a world of human solidarity, peace, and cooperation. Conflicts and war usually involve disputes over borders. So why not just get rid of these troublesome boundaries? Let’s have globalization – deregulated trade, capital mobility, and migration – only let’s bless them each with the adjective “free” rather than “deregulated”.

Neoclassical economists assure us that this will lead to peace and prosperity among rational utility-maximizing individuals, minimally governed by a benevolent World Democracy, dedicated to the post-modern values of scientific materialism, eloquently communicated in Esperanto. This vision has its serious appeal to many, but not so much to me, as the reader will by now have guessed.

Economic and political boundaries are necessary to achieve both national community, and a global federation of national communities living in peace and ecological sustainability. Boundaries are both biologically and logically necessary. Skin and membranes are organic boundaries. Within-skin versus outside-skin is a basic boundary condition for life. The skin boundary must be permeable, but not too permeable. If nothing enters or exits the organism it will soon die. If everything enters and exits, then the organism is already dead and decaying. Life requires boundaries that are neither completely closed nor completely open. A nation’s borders are in many ways very different from the skin of an organism, yet neither permits complete closure or complete openness. Both must be qualitatively and quantitatively selective in what they admit and expel, if their separate existence is to continue rather than be dissolved into entropic equilibrium with its environment.

Logically boundaries imply both inclusion and exclusion. A world without boundaries includes everything and is often therefore thought to be warm and friendly. But “everything” must include the cold and the unfriendly as well, or it is not everything. Also, without boundaries, B can be both A and non-A, which makes definition, contradiction, and analytical reasoning impossible. So both life and logical thinking require boundaries. While “a world without boundaries” may be a poetic expression of a desired unity, and while it is possible to reason dialectically with overlapping boundaries, it is a major delusion to think that boundaries are not necessary.

It is understandable, yet ironic, that the most fundamental and dramatic boundary of all – that separating the earth from outer space – made clear in the iconic photo of the earth from the moon – seems to have led to a reaction against the very concept of boundaries on our spherical planet, since it is so obviously one whole and unified thing. Yet that beautiful and powerful vision of overall unity hides a world of diversity and difference. And we live on the earth, within that complex living diversity, not on the dead moon with no need for life-defining boundaries.

The illth of nations and the weakness of policy

Our traditional economic problems (poverty, overpopulation, unemployment, unjust distribution) have all been thought to have a common solution – namely an increase in wealth. All problems are easier if we are richer. The way to get richer has been thought to be by economic growth, usually as measured by GDP. I do not here question the first proposition that richer is better than poorer, other things equal. But I do question whether what we persuasively label “economic growth” is any longer making us richer. I suggest that physical throughput growth is, at the present margin and in the aggregate, increasing illth faster than wealth, thus making us poorer rather than richer. Consequently our traditional economic problems become more difficult with further growth. The correlation between throughput growth and GDP growth is sufficiently strong historically so that in the absence of countervailing policies even GDP growth increases illth faster than wealth.

What we conventionally call “economic growth” in the sense of “growth of the economy” has ironically become “uneconomic growth” in the literal sense of growth that increases costs by more than it increases benefits. I am thinking here of the North rather than the South, because in many poor countries where the majority lives close to subsistence the benefits of production growth, even if badly distributed, justify incurring large costs. But since the South is striving, with encouragement from the IMF and World Bank, to become like the North, I am not really neglecting the South by focusing on the North, but rather raising a caution for the South.

One will surely ask, “how do I know that growth has become uneconomic for many Northern countries?” Some empirical evidence is referenced below.[10] But more convincing to me is the simple argument that as the scale of the human subsystem (the economy) expands relative to the fixed dimensions of the containing and sustaining ecosphere, we necessarily encroach upon that system and must pay the opportunity cost of lost ecosystem services as we enjoy the extra benefit of increased human scale. As rational beings we presumably satisfy our most pressing wants first, so that each increase in scale yields a diminishing marginal benefit. Likewise, we presumably would sequence our takeovers of the ecosystem so as to sacrifice first the least important natural services. Obviously we have not yet begun to do this because we are just now recognizing that natural services are scarce. But let me credit us with capacity to learn. Even so, that means that increasing marginal costs and decreasing marginal benefits will accompany increasing human scale. The optimum scale, from the human perspective, occurs when marginal cost equals marginal benefit. Beyond that point growth becomes uneconomic in the literal sense of costing more than it is worth.

It is interesting to know empirically if we have reached that point (I think we have, both globally and in many countries), but even if we have not, it is obvious that continued growth of a dependent subsystem relative to a finite sustaining total system will inevitably reach such an optimal scale. If we add to the limit of finitude of the total system the additional limits of entropy and complexity of ecological interdependence, then it is clear that the optimal scale will be encountered sooner rather than later. Additionally, if we expand our anthropocentric view of the optimum scale to a more biocentric view, by which I mean one that attributes not only instrumental but also intrinsic value to other species, then it is clear that the scale of the human presence should be further limited by the duty to reserve a place in the sun for other species, even beyond what they “pay for” in terms of their instrumental value to us. And of course the whole idea of “sustainability” is that the optimal scale should exist for a very long time, not just a few generations. Clearly a sustainable scale will be smaller than an unsustainable scale. For all these reasons I think that for policy purposes we do not need exact empirical measures of the optimal scale. If one jumps from an airplane it may be nice to have an altimeter, but what one really needs is a parachute.

So what policies constitute a parachute? Briefly, they are policies that limit aggregate throughput, while allowing the market to allocate that limited throughput – assuming the market is competitive and confined to some limited degree of inequality in the distribution of wealth and income. Such policy instruments are evolving now – e.g., cap-auction-trade systems for extraction rights, pollution emission rights, fishing rights, etc. Also ecological tax reform limits throughput by making it more expensive. It shifts the tax base from value added (something we want more of) on to “that to which value is added”, namely the resource throughput (something we want to use less of). In differing ways each of the above “parachutes” would limit throughput and expansion of the scale of the economy into the ecosystem, and also provide public revenue. I will not discuss their relative merits, having to do with price versus quantity interventions in the market, but rather emphasize the advantage that both have over the currently favored strategy. The currently favored strategy might be called “efficiency first” in distinction to the “frugality first” principle embodied in both of the throughput-limiting mechanisms mentioned above, but more stringently in the second.

“Efficiency first” sounds good, especially when referred to as “win-win” strategies, or more picturesquely as “picking the low-hanging fruit”. But the problem of “efficiency first” is with what comes second. An improvement in efficiency by itself is equivalent to having a larger supply of the factor whose efficiency increased. The price of that factor will decline. More uses for the now cheaper factor will be found. We may end up consuming more of the resource than before, albeit more efficiently. Scale continues to grow. This is sometimes called the “Jevons effect”. A policy of “frugality first”, however, induces efficiency as a secondary consequence; “efficiency first” does not induce frugality – it makes frugality less necessary, nor does it give rise to a scarcity rent that can be captured and redistributed by tax or auction.

So far I have briefly outlined what I take to be the problem of the “illth of nations” (apologies to both Adam Smith and John Ruskin), and indicated some policy guidelines for avoiding the uneconomic growth that increases illth faster than wealth. These views do not find favor with mainstream economists. The concepts of throughput, of entropy, and even of optimal scale of the macroeconomy are foreign to them. The last is especially odd since in microeconomics the concept of the optimal scale of each micro activity is central. Yet the sum of all micro activities, the macro economy, is not thought to have an optimal scale relative to its sustaining ecosystem. Probably this is because macroeconomists think of the macroeconomy as the Whole, not as a Part of some larger Whole. For them nature is not a containing envelope, but just a sector of the macroeconomy – mines, wells, croplands, pastures, and fisheries. When the Whole grows it expands into the Void encroaching on nothing and incurring no opportunity cost. But of course the real economy is a Part and it grows not into the Void, but into the rest of the biosphere, and really does incur opportunity costs. I have long considered this Whole versus Part difference to reflect different pre-analytic visions (Schumpeter) or different paradigms (Kuhn). Different pre-analytic visions cannot, of course, be reconciled by further analysis, and they have different policy implications.

Even if we could agree on the right pre-analytic vision of the basic way the world is, would we then be able to enact and follow effective policies? So far, our capacity to enact policies of “frugality first” seems very weak. Indeed, even “efficiency first” policies are still resisted. So let us turn our attention to the question of policy in general, and policy fecklessness in particular.

What are the presuppositions we must make before we can reasonably and seriously discuss policy – policy of any kind? There are two that I can see.

First, we must believe that there are real alternatives among which to choose. If there are no alternatives, if everything is determined, then it hardly makes sense to discuss policy–what will be will be. No options, no responsibility, no need to think.

Second, even if there were real alternatives, policy dialogue would still make no sense unless there was a real criterion of value by which to choose from among the alternatives. Unless we can distinguish better from worse states of the world then it makes no sense to try to achieve one state of the world rather than another. No value criterion, no responsibility, no need to think.

In sum, serious policy must presuppose: (1) nondeterminism – that the world is not totally determined, that there is an element of freedom which offers us real alternatives; and (2) nonnihilism – that there is a real criterion of value to guide our choices, however vaguely we may perceive it.

To be sure, not every conceivable alternative is a real alternative. Many things really are impossible. But the number of viable possibilities permitted by physical law and past history is seldom reduced to only one. Through our choices, value and purpose lure the physical world in one direction rather than the other. Purpose is independently causative in the world.

This seems pretty obvious to common sense – so what is the point of stating the obvious? The point is that many members of the intelligentsia deny one or both presuppositions, and yet want to engage in policy dialogue. I don’t mean that we disagree on exactly what our alternatives are in a particular instance, or about just what our value criterion implies for a concrete case. That is part of the reasonable policy dialogue. I mean that determinists who deny the effective existence of alternatives, and nihilists or relativists who deny the existence of value beyond the level of subjective personal tastes, have no right to engage in policy dialogue – and yet they do! This is my cordial invitation to them to shut up – at least about policy.

Who are these people? In the sciences I am thinking about the materialist neo-Darwinists and socio-biologists; in the humanities, the post-modern deconstructionists; and in the social sciences, those economists who reduce value to subjective individual tastes any one of which is as good as another.

No one can in practice live by the creed of determinism or nihilism. In this sense no one takes them seriously, so we tend to discount any effect on policy of these doctrines. We tend to dismiss them as academic posturings. However, we may halfway suspect that the many learned people who publicly proclaim these frequently unopposed views might be right–and that is sometimes enough to enfeeble policy. For example, many people tell me that globalization is inevitable; any attempt to counter global economic integration is futile, or “on the wrong side of history”, etc. If I manage to convince them that globalization is the result of past policy choices, and therefore might not be inevitable, the next line of defense is, how do we know that globalization will be any worse than the alternative? We cannot tell, we don’t really know that globalization won’t be good for us (because we don’t know what is good in the first place), so there is no point in opposing it. Either it is inevitable, or if not then we can have no reason to believe that any alternative would be better. Forget policy, go back to sleep.

Perhaps I can clarify this controversial point by distinguishing four categories based on acceptance or non-acceptance of each of the two presuppositions identified.
• The traditional Judeo-Christian view – there exist real alternatives from which to choose by reference to objective criteria of value.
• Criterionless choice – alternatives are real options, but there is no objective criterion for choosing among them. (Existentialist angst)
• Providential determinism – there are no real options, but there is an objective criterion of value by which to choose, if only we had a choice. Fortunately providence has chosen for us according to the objective criterion, which we would not be wise or good enough to have followed on our own. (Theological predestination; technological providentialism)
• Criterionless determinism – there are no real alternatives to choose from, and even if there were, there is no objective criterion of value by which to choose. All is mechanism – random variation and natural selection, as claimed by the neo-Darwinist materialists.

People engaged in policy, yet holding to positions (2), (3), or (4) are in the grip of a severe and debilitating inconsistency. Their participation in policy dialogue should be subject to the injunction of “estoppel” – a legal restraint to prevent witnesses from contradicting their own testimony. It should be applied in academia as well as in the courtroom!

Avoiding the uneconomic growth that is increasing the illth of nations will require clear and forceful policy to limit growth. All policy, especially such a radical one, requires a belief in both objective value and real alternatives. The fact that many people engaged in discussing and making policy reject one or both of these presuppositions is, in A. N. Whitehead’s term, “the lurking inconsistency”, a contradiction at the basis of the modern worldview which enfeebles thought and renders action feckless.[11] If we even halfway believe that purpose is an illusion foisted on us by our genes to somehow make us more efficient at procreation, or that one state of the world is, for all we can tell, as good as another, then it is hard to get serious about policy. Whitehead noted, “Scientists animated by the purpose of proving that they are purposeless constitute an interesting subject for study”. He went on to say that, “It is not popular to dwell on the absolute contradiction here involved”.

I think, 85 years later, that it is high time we dwelt on this absolute contradiction. We pay a price for ignoring contradictions – in this case the price is feebleness of purpose and half- heartedness in policy. Citizens really must affirm that the world offers more than one possibility to choose from, and that some choices really are better than others. Determinists and nihilists have a right to exist, but an obligation to remain silent on policy!

This willful neglect has allowed the lurking inconsistency to metastasize into the marrow of modernity. The Enlightenment, with its rejection of teleology, certainly illuminated some hidden recesses of superstition in the so-called Dark Ages. But the angle of its cold light has also cast a deep shadow forward into the modern world, obscuring the reality of purpose. To conserve Creation we will first have to reclaim purpose from that darkness. I say Creation with a capital “C” advisedly, and certainly not in denial of the established facts of evolution. If our world and our lives are not in some sense a Creation, but just a purposeless happenstance – a random statistical fluke of multiplying infinitesimal probabilities by an infinite number of trials – then it is hard to see from where we will get the will and inspiration to care for it.

Indeed, our decision-making elites may already tacitly understand that growth has become uneconomic. But apparently they have also figured out how to keep the dwindling extra benefits for themselves, while “sharing” the exploding extra costs with the poor, the future, and other species. Why not, if it is all just a purposeless happenstance? The elite-owned media, the corporate-funded think tanks, the kept economists of high academia, and the World Bank – not to mention Goldman-Sachs and Wall Street – all sing hymns to growth in harmony with class interest and greed. The public is bamboozled by technical obfuscation, and by the false promise of growthism that one day we will all be rich. Intellectual confusion is real, but moral nihilism, abetted by naturalistic scientism, is the more basic problem. Such nihilism is hard to counter without strong appeal to the idea of purpose, of telos, and without raising its cosmic and religious implications. Many policies are being offered. But until the presuppositions of policy have been met they will remain just academic exercises.

If annual growth in Gross World Product is around 2.2%, and cost due to pollution is 6.2%, then with reasonable accounting we would have a net financial decline of some 4% annually. If that financial decline represents welfare loss, and it surely does since we are talking about reduced health and life expectancy, then the benefits of production growth are being more than cancelled out by the costs of the pollution generated by that growth. In other words, so-called “economic” growth has become uneconomic. That seems to have escaped the notice of economists.

406,"The Construction Industry in Sweden & Denmark, 2018-2019 - Focus on Circular Economy in Construction Pushing the Use of Environmental Certification Schemes in Europe","Dublin, March 28, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""The Impact of Environmental Certification Schemes on the Construction Industry in Sweden and Denmark, 2018"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.



The construction industry in Europe is expected to be bolstered by the re-development and renovation activities in Western Europe and new construction activities in Eastern Europe, on account of greater economic stability in the continent.



Increasing construction activity augurs well for the prefabricated construction market and high growth in adaptability for prefabricated materials such as wood and concrete can be expected. Germany is the biggest market for prefab constructions in Europe, followed by Scandinavian countries and the United Kingdom.

Despite Scandinavia being a key market for prefabricated homes, the prefabricated concrete market is expected to have limited growth, due to preference for wood as a prefab material. The setting time of concrete is a major factor that drives preference for other construction materials, especially in cold countries such as Denmark and Sweden. Setting of concrete is delayed in cold weathers, leading to delay in construction activities.



There is increased focus on developing construction projects in a more sustainable manner, so that the buildings constructed or re-developed have minimal environmental impact over the course of their lifecycle-right from construction until demolition. This has resulted in the development of a circular value chain for the construction industry in Europe, which is being adopted as a pilot project in countries such as Germany and the Netherlands. The focus on green development has also led to the adoption of practices such as certification of buildings as green buildings and certification of materials used in building and construction as green materials.

Green building certifications adopted in Europe primarily constitute LEED and BREEAM and local certifications in individual countries such as Miljbyggnad in Sweden and DGNB in Denmark. Regulations by entities such as Conformit Europene (CE) and EcoLabel in Europe affect the building materials market. These specifications aim to restrict the use of environmentally harmful chemicals to ensure product lifecycle sustainability.



Denmark and Sweden are Scandinavian countries with their individual focus on sustainable construction, as evident from the development of sustainable construction in Stockholm Port in Sweden and Sonderborg in Denmark. These have been identified as cities that have reduced carbon emissions by up to 25% by 2015 from that in 2008. The development of such cities is expected to drive the growth of passive homes in Europe, which are typically prefabricated using energy-efficient materials and fittings. Both Denmark and Sweden are compliant with Nordic Swan EcoLabel when it comes to regulations pertaining to the usage of green building materials for the construction of buildings.

Amy Will Partner with Two U.S. National Labs and Leading U.S. Universities

SURREY, BC / ACCESSWIRE / March 28, 2019 / American Manganese Inc. (AMY) is pleased to announce that that the Company will participate in a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) project to advance the economic recovery of Lithium-ion battery materials from electric vehicles and other consumer goods.

The project, formally titled “Lithium Ion Battery Disassembly, Remanufacturing, and Lithium & Cobalt Recovery Project,” focuses on developing an economic recovery strategy for critical materials in end-of-use lithium-ion batteries from electric and hybrid electric vehicles and other consumer goods such as electric bicycles and power tools. The project commences immediately, under the aegis of the Critical Materials Institute (CMI), an Energy Innovation Hub, led by Ames Laboratory and supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Advanced Manufacturing Office.

“AMY is very pleased to become the first private-sector company to participate in this project,” said Larry Reaugh, CEO of American Manganese. “We’re honored to be working with world-renowned national labs and leading U.S. universities on an issue that will dramatically impact our ability to meet rising material demand for lithium, cobalt, manganese and nickel.”

Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, ORNL is the largest multidisciplinary science and energy national laboratory in the DOE system.

Idaho National Lab (INL). Located in Idaho Falls, Idaho, the nation’s leading center for nuclear energy research and development performs work in energy systems, national security, science and environment.

Purdue University and Case Western Reserve University are also project partners.

American Manganese Inc. is a critical metal company with a patent approved process for the recovery of metals from lithium-ion batteries such as cobalt, lithium, nickel, manganese, and aluminum. Using a novel combination of reagents and unit operations, AMY can provide 100% extraction of cathode metals at battery grade purity. American Manganese Inc. aims to capitalize on its patent approved technology and proprietary know-how to become the industry leader in recycling spent electric vehicle lithium-ion batteries ( Please see the Company’s December 14, 2018 Business Plan for further details ).

413,Reverse logistics: How can retailers support the circular economy?,"The birth of the “circular economy” is forcing retailers and brands to consider not only how to get products to customers but how to get them back again.

The circular economy is a proposed alternative to the traditional “linear” one in which products are made, used and disposed of. The aim is to try and keep resources in use as long as possible to extract the maximum value from them and then recover materials from them.

This could take a number of forms, from increased usage of recycling to leasing products rather than buying them. Its benefits can include a lower environmental impact and a lower product cost for customers buying second-hand products.

A report by Thredup anticipates that the resale market will reach $41 billion by 2022, with apparel accounting for 49% of this. One in three women shopped second hand last year. Another survey found that 78% of consumers said they always recycle their unwanted possessions, with 26% strongly agreeing with the statement.

To achieve this, companies will have to find ways of recovering products from customers in a convenient and cost-effective way.

One prominent company with ambitious recycling targets in Nespresso, which first began recycling capsules in 1991. The beverage company uses aluminium in its capsules but the majority of this can be repurposed for use in new ones.

Nespresso offers pre-paid recycling bags from UPS so that consumers can send back capsules to be recycled. Customers can request the bags from a Nespresso boutique, order them online or call the customer service centre. They then simply give them to a UPS driver or take them to dedicated drop-off points.

The coffee brand also recently made a $1.2 million commitment to enable the recovery of its aluminum coffee capsules through New York City’s curbside recycling programme. This means that customers can simply place them with their normal recycling.

John Lewis is another company allowing customers to hand products over at the door. Berangere Michel, operations director at John Lewis, explained in a panel at Retail Week Live that sustainability is increasing as a theme in terms of how much it is being talked about. However, she believes it is unproven whether this translates to changes in actual consumer behaviour.

An innovative partnership with sister company Waitrose allows customers to hand over a John Lewis return to a Waitrose driver. Benefits include the cost savings of only having one driver going to the home and the fact it encourages customers to become customers of both.

She is hopeful this partnership could expand to other areas in the future.

Click and return is also becoming a popular channel for consumers to send products back to retailers. Click and collect provider CollectPlus works with SodaStream, which makes machines for carbonating water at home. These come in canisters which the company is able to refill if they are returned.

“The click and collect returns service can work in a multitude of ways for recycling and, crucially, it means that customers can do this on their terms,” says Neil Ashworth, CEO at CollectPlus. The company has 7000 points across the UK, located in the likes of corner stores.

Ashworth highlights the appeal of the circular economy to the millennial cohort in particular.

“Two key purchase-decision-making factors for this demographic are sustainability, to reduce the environment impact of purchases, and convenience, so that customers can fit shopping around their busy lifestyles.”

These various experiments with reverse logistics all have one thing in common: convenience. To truly participate in the circular economy, customers will have to be able to send products back at their convenience with the minimum of fuss.",United States,2019.03
417,Engel Signs New Plastics Economy Global Commitment,"In mid-March 2019, Engel was one of the first plastic machine manufacturers to sign the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. The aim of the initiative is to create a circular economy. In cooperation with more than 350 other companies, universities and organizations, Engel has committed itself to actively contributing to the transfer of plastics into closed material cycles.

The New Plastics Economy Global Commitment is led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, in collaboration with UN Environment, and is signed by many of the worlds largest packaging producers, brands, retailers and recyclers, as well as governments and NGOs. Signatories include well-known consumer businesses such as Danone, H&M Group, L’Oreal, Mars, Incorporated, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, and Unilever; major packaging producers such as Amcor; plastics producers including Novamont, and resource management specialist Veolia.

Engel supports its customers in designing and producing packaging according to the rules of the circular economy and in opening up a wider range of applications for recycled materials. In this regard, the focus is on the following topics:
• To guarantee a high process consistency and to prevent rejects with the help of intelligent assistant systems, even when the raw material is subject to strong quality fluctuations, as is often the case with recycled materials.
• To further increase the proportion of recycled material in sandwich components with the aid of innovative processing technologies.
• Working closely with processors in the course of product development with the goal of reducing material usage and enabling the subsequent recycling of products.
• To further strengthen the consulting services in the area of upstream processes in order to optimize the processing of recycled materials for injection molding.

The Global Commitment aims to create ‘a new normal’ for plastic packaging. Targets will be reviewed every 18 months, and become increasingly ambitious over the coming years. Businesses that sign the commitment will publish annual data on their progress to help drive momentum and ensure transparency.

“As a member of the international plastics industry, we are not only responsible for our own products, but also for the products that are produced on our machines,"" says Stefan Engleder, CEO of the Engel Group, headquartered in Schwertberg, Austria. “It is important to us to utilize our experience and knowledge to ensure that people in all regions of the world will handle plastics responsibly and that the conditions are created for plastic products to be returned to the material cycle at the end of their useful life. As an individual company, our influence is limited. This is precisely why we are involved in the New Plastics Economy Initiative. It networks the global players and makes our common concern more heard.""",United States,2019.03
420,Fortum Process Recycles 80% Of EV Battery Materials,"Fortum, a Finland-based clean energy and electric vehicle charging company that is involved with a plan to install wireless EV chargers for taxis in Oslo, has also created a new process that makes more than 80% of EV battery materials recyclable. In particular, it focuses on recapturing the nickel, cobalt, and other metals that are associated with environmental or humanitarian concerns. Current EU rules only require 50% of battery materials to be recycled.

In a press release, Kalle Saarimaa, vice president of Fortum Recycling and Waste, says, “There are very few working, economically viable technologies for recycling the majority of materials used in lithium-ion batteries. We saw a challenge that was not yet solved and developed a scalable recycling solution for all industries using batteries.”

To achieve a recycling rate of more than 80%, Fortum uses a low-CO2 hydro-metallurgical recycling process. First, the batteries are made safe for mechanical treatment, then the plastics, aluminium, and copper inside are separated and directed to their own recycling areas.

The chemical and mineral components of the battery form a “black mass” that is a mixture of lithium, manganese, cobalt, and nickel in different ratios. Nickel and cobalt are the most valuable, but are also the most difficult to recover. Using technology developed by Finnish company Crisolteq, Fortum uses chemical precipitation methodology that allows these minerals to be recovered and delivered to battery manufacturers for use in new batteries.

Crisolteq and Fortum have built a hydro-metallurgical recycling facility in Harjavalta, Finland, where that “black mass” is treated on an industrial scale. “Circular economy in its strictest sense means recycling an element to its original function or purpose. When we discuss the recycling of lithium ion batteries, the ultimate aim is for the majority of the battery’s components to be recycled to new batteries,” Saarimaa says.

If some forecasts for the number of EVs on the road 10 years from now are accurate, there will be an 800% increase in the demand for nickel and manganese and a 150% increase in the demand for cobalt for the production of new batteries. Mining operations to obtain those elements would see an increase in greenhouse gas emissions of 500% from this sector. By using recycled materials, CO2 emissions from battery production can be reduced by as much as 90%.

“Limited availability and the environmental impacts of mining mean that recycling these scarce elements back to battery manufacturing is key to reducing the environmental impacts of battery use throughout the lifecycle. If we don’t get the materials back into circulation, we will run out of materials,” Saarimaa suggests.

Not content to focus just on recycling, Fortum is also working on “second life” applications for batteries that are no longer satisfactory for use in vehicles but can still be used in energy storage roles. The company is work to promote more storage functions for depleted EV batteries.

Perhaps the most valuable lesson from what Fortum is doing is its focus on promoting a circular economy. If the Earth has any chance of addressing the perils of warming temperatures, a paradigm shift in how business is transacted will be essential. Business as usual is killing us all. It’s amazing how many people are okay with that and can’t be bothered to understand what is happening right in front of their eyes.",United States,2019.03
421,Fortum boosts Li-ion battery recycling rate to more than 80%,"A new solution by Nordic clean energy company Fortum makes more than 80% of an electric vehicle (EV) battery recyclable, returns the scarce metals back into circulation and resolves the sustainability gap by reducing the need to mine cobalt, nickel, and other scarce metals.

Fortum achieves the recycling rate of over 80% with a low-CO hydrometallurgical recycling process. The current recycling rate for batteries is approximately 50%.

The batteries are first made safe for mechanical treatment, with plastics, aluminum and copper separated and directed to their own recycling processes.

The chemical and mineral components of the battery form a “black mass” that typically consists of a mixture of lithium, manganese, cobalt and nickel in different ratios. Of these, nickel—and especially cobalt—are the most valuable and most difficult to recover.

Fortum is using use a unique recovery process involving a chemical precipitation methodology that allows these minerals to be recovered and delivered to battery manufacturers for reuse in the production of new batteries. This technology was developed by the Finnish growth company Crisolteq Oy.

Crisolteq has a hydrometallurgical recycling facility in Harjavalta, Finland, that is already able to operate on an industrial scale.

Fortum is also piloting second-life applications for batteries in which the EV batteries are used in stationary energy storages after they are no longer fit for their original purpose.

According to one forecast by the International Energy Agency, the number of electric vehicles on the world’s roads will increase from 3 million to 125 million by 2030. Batteries powering electric vehicles consume huge amounts of plastics, metals and rare minerals. The current EU regulation on the recycling rate for batteries is only 50% of the total weight of the battery.

If the IEA’s EV forecast holds true, it would mean an 800% increase in the demand for nickel and manganese and a 150% increase in the demand for cobalt for the production of new batteries. These scarce minerals, mined from very few locations, would increase the greenhouse gas emissions from their production by 500%. Using recycled materials also reduces the CO emissions from production up to 90%.

Limited availability and the environmental impacts of mining mean that recycling these scarce elements back to battery manufacturing is key to reducing the environmental impacts of battery use throughout the life cycle, Fortum says.",United States,2019.03
422,Target Sets Its Sights on Scope 3 Emissions with New Climate Goals,"Today, Target announced its most ambitious climate goals to date — to reduce its absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions. The new goals will reduce the retail giant’s carbon footprint from source to shelf, as it works alongside its supply chain partners to lower emissions throughout its value chain.

Target has made the following commitments:
• To reduce its absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent below 2017 levels by 2030.
• 80 percent of its suppliers will set science-based reduction targets on their Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2023.
• Join us to hear how major brands including CVS, Nestlé, Pepsi, P&G, SAP, Target, Visa and more are using their brand influence to foster and support more sustainable consumer behaviors — at the SB Leadership Summit, SB's first virtual event, June 1-2. Tell me more! These goals have been approved by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi).

This is the first time that Target has put its entire supply chain under a greenhouse gas reduction goal, from which 96 percent of emissions related to its business are generated; Target is one of only a few US retailers to have an SBTi-approved Scope 3 goal, setting a bar for the industry — as Levi Strauss did for the apparel industry with its similarly ambitious goals last year.

The new goals build on — and increase the impact of — Target’s previous science-based climate goals, set in 2017. In a blog post this morning, Target says the key will be unifying its suppliers around these same goals.

“Our new climate goals will reduce our carbon footprint from source to shelf, as we work alongside our partners within our supply chain to lower emissions and help create a better tomorrow,” said Target chairman and CEO Brian Cornell. “We have a responsibility to our guests and the environment to set high expectations and encourage ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, promoting positive change throughout the industry to have an even greater impact for generations to come.”

To refresh, greenhouse gas emissions are broken down into three categories:
• Scope 3: Emissions generated from the entire supply chain, such as the creation of the products and services sold at Target

Target partnered with industry expert Anthesis for guidance to ensure these goals met the rigorous requirements of the SBTi.

“It’s vital for companies, particularly major retailers, to lower the emissions in their supply chain if they are serious about addressing their environmental impact,” said Dexter Galvin, Global Director of Corporations & Supply Chains at CDP, an SBTi partner. “We applaud Target for setting ambitious goals covering their entire supply chain, and hope more companies can follow in their footsteps to boldly address and combat climate change, to create a thriving economy for people and planet.”

To reduce its Scope 1 and 2 emissions, Target says it will continue to ramp up investments in renewable energy and energy-saving efforts across the business — including installing LED lights in stores and offices, offsetting the electricity use of 60 area stores with its Texas wind power project, and adding solar rooftop panels at 500 locations by 2020.

To reduce Scope 3 emissions, the retailer says it will work with its suppliers to transition to renewable energy sources and implement their own emissions-reduction projects. It will also expand its Clean by Design initiative, by partnering with the Apparel Impact Institute to scale performance improvement programs that focus on reducing energy use and emissions in our suppliers’ factories; and leverage its Vietnam Improvement Program in partnership with the International Finance Corporation as it increases factories’ energy and water efficiency.",United States,2019.03
423,Financing the Circular Economy,"A new report released by the European Commission’s Expert Group on Circular Economy Financing outlines the ways in which access to finance for circular economy projects can be improved. The report provides specific recommendations for key stakeholders: financial institutions, project promoters and policy makers.

It is broadly recognised that current production and consumption patterns are unsustainable. Our current linear model, where we expend natural resources to create products, consume and then discard them is creating severe consequences for the environment. Projected population growth heightens the need to institute a new economic paradigm, where we reuse, recycle, repair and share. Known as the circular economy, it means an end to the waste culture and offers the chance to create a more sustainable type of growth.

Instituting a circular economy will reduce industrial emissions, reduce the production of, and exposure to, hazardous materials and contribute to climate change mitigation. In the European Union (EU), the circular economy is viewed as an opportunity for the (relatively) resource-poor continent to secure access to vital resources, maintain global competitiveness and ensure a high quality environment for Europe, and the world for that matter. However, achieving systemic change is no insignificant task. Successfully negotiating the transition to a more circular economy will require the combined efforts of governments, businesses, investors, businesses, innovators and consumers.

The EU is already on the way, having launched its Circular Economy action plan in 2015 and since then devoted almost EUR 2 billion to circular economy research and innovation projects, as well as substantial sums to support eco-technologies and the implementation of EU waste legislation.

As a member of the EU, Denmark has supported these developments and is itself aiming to become a circular economy hotspot. The Danish government released a national strategy for circular economy based on recommendations from the government’s circular economy advisory board. To ensure the strategy is implemented, the government has set aside EUR 16 million. Furthermore, Denmark has entered into a partnership with the World Economic Forum to accelerate the transition.

While many businesses in the EU are ready with projects that advance the circular economy, gaining financing is proving challenging. It is estimated that EUR 320 billion will be needed between now and 20255 to implement projects that put the European economy on the path to transition. The main barrier in obtaining financing for these types of projects centres around the role of risk: perceptions of it and how it is assessed. From a business perspective, the financial sector is overstating the risks associated with financing circular economy projects, while the financial sector deems these types of projects as inherently risky and therefore not always bankable.

To help bridge the financing gap, the European Commission has established Expert Group on Circular Economy Financing. Consisting of a broad range of experts from government, civil society, the business community and the financial world such as the European Investment Bank and national banks from several member states, the group has met for over a year to formulate recommendations on how to overcome the financing challenge and which incentives should be put in place.

Specific recommendations for policy makers, financial institutions and project promoters

The group’s work has culminated in a series of specific recommendations to three key stakeholder groups, namely financial institutions, project promoters and policy makers. The recommendations and a summary of the group’s discussions are presented in a report released this month by the Commission. Titled ‘Accelerating the transition to the circular economy – Improving access to finance for circular economy projects’, the report proposes three sets of recommendations that, if implemented, should together provide a framework that significantly improves access to finance for circular economy projects.

Recommendations range from measures aimed at increasing awareness of the circular economy in the financial sector, developing a definition of what constitutes a circular economy project etc to more longer-term actions such legislative changes at the EU and national level, thereby ensuring public actors facilitate the transition to a circular economy.

Main areas where incentives need to be provided to improve financing for circular economy projects include the issue of a level playing field, improving value-chain collaboration, ensuring long-term value creation, better market participation from consumers, integration of the public good, educating finance professionals within circular business models, knowledge build-up and first-mover action.

It is expected that the recommendations will contribute to the ongoing work of the European initiative on sustainable finance. Currently sustainable finance initiatives in the EU are focused on climate change and adaption, but will be expanded to include circular economy in the future.

425,Closed Loop Partners' Ron Gonen on investing in circularity | Greenbiz,"This article has been adapted from the Circular Weekly newsletter, running Fridays. Subscribe here.

Every emerging industry needs champions. Over the coming months, I’ll be running a series of brief interviews with circular economy leaders that are showing the way.

This week, I spoke with Ron Gonen, co-founder and CEO of Closed Loop Partners, an investment firm focused on developing the circular economy through investments in sustainable consumer goods and packaging companies, innovative recycling technologies and advanced supply chains. With investors including Amazon, Procter & Gamble, Unilever and Coca-Cola, the fund has deployed $50 million across 21 projects and secured $210 million in additional co-investment to date, according to its 2018 Impact Report, released this week.

The following conversation has been edited for clarity and length.

Lauren Phipps: What are you excited about right now?

Ron Gonen: I’m excited about the recognition among the CEOs of major consumer goods companies that circular supply chains are opportunities for them to significantly reduce costs. That recognition is what’s going to lead to updating their supply chains from linear ones that rely on a lot of extraction and landfills, to circular ones that benefit their bottom line and the environment.

Phipps: What’s the biggest obstacle you see in advancing your work?

Gonen: The biggest obstacle to advancing the circular economy is the flow of capital. We need more capital flowing into the circular economy space in order to finance the infrastructure required. We need major banks and major investment firms to better understand the opportunity, and to start investing.

Phipps: What will it take to get these players to understand that opportunity?

Gonen: We in the circular economy space are first responsible to make sure we communicate the opportunity well to those financial players so that they clearly see why it’s in their best interest to invest. I think that’s No. 1. I think No. 2 is we need to have some nice wins in the circular economy space so investors see the opportunity.

We view SodaStream as the perfect example of an investment in the circular economy that made a lot of money for the investors and the employees at SodaStream. A great example of that is the SodaStream acquisition by PepsiCo. We view SodaStream as a great example of sustainable product design and circular economy where you’re able to deliver flavored beverages to consumers without all of the plastic packaging and water that’s traditionally used in the delivery of beverages to consumers. It’s the perfect example of an investment that made a lot of money for the investors and the employees at SodaStream, and it was a great, strategic acquisition by PepsiCo in terms of where they are going in the future. The more we see these sorts of success stories, the more and more people will take note.

Phipps: What’s keeping you up at night?

Gonen: Making sure that our firm is focused on the right areas, backing the right companies and ensuring that we’re able to get the right amount of capital to flow into this space. I’m not sure it keeps me up at night necessarily, but it’s something that’s top of mind.

We’re battling some very powerful legacy industries. There’s the petrochemical industry that wants to continue to use virgin plastics, and there’s the landfill industry that wants to continue to put these materials in the landfill. In order to counter their growth, we need sufficient amounts of capital to flow into the circular economy space so our initiatives can grow.",United States,2019.03
426,PET in the Circular Economy: Member states to meet EU PET recycling capacity,"Since 1993, the entire PET value chain has been ready to industrially recycle PET to an extent that the PET recycling companies have always been in overcapacity in the EU.

Ambitious recycling targets have been set by the EU Plastics Strategy to ensure collection and sorting meets recycling capacities. Petcore Europe and the Parliament Magazine therefore organised two roundtable discussions in the European Parliament.

During the first discussion on 19 February, the PET industry shared best practices with EU policymakers, NGOs and stakeholders.

The second event on 20 March, hosted by MEP Mark Demesmaeker, Belgium, focused on ways forward regarding collection and sorting; Patrick Laevers from Fost Plus presented Belgium's curbside collection system; Wolfgang Ringel from Tomra focused on the strong sides of deposit schemes; and Gian De Belder from Procter & Gamble presented the Pioneer project HolyGrail, where brand owners work on tagging plastic packaging for accurate sorting.

Executive Director of Petcore Europe Christian Crépet said: ""European PET recyclers lack material to reprocess, to an extent that there is an unused capacity of 296,400 tonnes. Insufficient quantity and quality of collection can be observed in several EU countries. Increased collection and sorting of PET bottles and trays, be it via curbside collection or deposit schemes, would ensure sustainability and circularity of PET packaging.""

Demesmaeker pointed out that the Single Use Plastics Directive will bring separate collection targets of 90 per cent for PET beverage bottles by 2029, which is an important achievement and a necessary, binding target.

Grzegorz Raziejewski, Member of Cabinet of Commissioner Jyrki Katainen and Malgorzata Golebiewska from DG ENVI shared the European Commissions plan to drive collection and sorting.

Industry representatives from the entire PET value chain and policymakers will contimnue to collaborate to reach the ambitious collection and recycling targets.

428,Sustainable RAUM pavilion by Overtreders W can be recycled or reused,"Overtreders W employed the principles of a circular economy when designing the temporary RAUM pavilion in Utrecht, the Netherlands.

Located at the public exhibition square RAUM, the pavilion offers a meeting space and restaurant for people to reside between attending exhibitions, lectures or workshops – but it is only required for three years.

Amsterdam studio Overtreders W therefore developed the structure to be easily disassembled and rebuilt in a new location, or completely recycled and composted at the end of its lifespan.

""Building for the circular economy is very important for us. It means we always think beforehand of what will happen to our projects after their lifespan, and use materials from renewable sources, either new or second hand,"" the studio's co-founder Hester van Dijk told Dezeen.

""The RAUM pavilion can be taken apart and moved to a new location. If it does become derelict after a decade or so, it can be easily dismantled.""

RAUM pavilion was required to accommodate different sized groups, varying from two to 80 people. Therefore, it is made from three adjoining volumes that can be separated or used as one open space.

Alongside the restaurant, it contains a kitchen, storage area and bathroom, and an elevated meeting area that can closed by a curtain to hold events.

The pavilion's structure is made from wood, and clad with polycarbonate panels that attach to the wooden frame with bright yellow bolts. These are designed to be easily separated.

Splashes of colour decorate the polycarbonate, where the studio has slotted pieces of waste perspex inside the hollow core of the panels.

Alongside photovoltaic panels, the RAUM pavilion also features a Trombe wall – a building technology that combines thermal mass and glazing to passively heat buildings.

""The pavilion is very energy efficient, it makes use of passive cooling and heating, photovoltaic panels on the roof help to keep the energy use very low,"" added Dijk.

Inside, the pavilion has a staggered, insulated floor lined with recycled plastic panels, which rest on wooden beams atop a concrete foundation.

Meanwhile, chunky wooden trusses with bright yellow gusset plates characterise the space, and are decorated with hanging plants.

Overtreders W is a small Amsterdam spatial design agency founded by Design Academy in Eindhoven graduates Reinder Bakker and Hester van Dijk, which specialises in temporary structures.

In 2017, the studio collaborated with Bureau SLA to create the People's Pavilion at Dutch Design Week, which used only borrowed or recycled materials and had ""almost no ecological footprint"". More recently, it completed a zero-waste barn and restaurant for a Dutch festival.",United States,2019.03

431,Retooling Recycling and Saving the Earth: A Practice Advisory for all Nonprofits,"It was always a little dubious that US cities, in the name of recycling, would ship millions of tons of recyclable material, often mixed in with trash, to China—as if moving these items thousands of miles did not require a significant expenditure of fossil fuels. But now that China has said “no more” to these imports, local communities are having to change their practices, notes National Public Radio reporter Christopher Joyce.

The result of the upheaval: Recycling centers across the US—both nonprofit and otherwise—have been losing funding, rethinking collections, and sometimes burning plastics that can no longer be shipped overseas.

Why should the nonprofit sector care, especially organizations outside of the environmental movement? Just as all nonprofits are part of the same global community, every sector has a stake in the increasingly bleak outlook for the world’s shared climate. And, if diversity, equity and inclusion are everyone’s business, so is climate change. (Not to mention the fact that even in the US, “air pollution is disproportionately caused by white Americans’ consumption of goods and services, but disproportionately inhaled by black and [Latinx] Americans,” as NPR reported recently.)

As Joyce summarizes, the tipping point has been a long time coming. In fact, the system has even perpetuated inequality, as wealthier countries relied on China’s cheap labor to dispose of plastic waste:

For years, America sold millions of tons of used yogurt cups, juice containers, shampoo bottles and other kinds of plastic trash to China to be recycled into new products. And it wasn’t just the US. Some 70 percent of the world’s plastic waste went to China—about 7 million tons a year… But last year the Chinese government dropped a bombshell on the world recycling business: It cut back almost all imports of trash. And now a lot of that plastic gets shipped to other countries that don’t have the capacity to recycle it or dispose of it safely.

Joyce also profiles Recycling Partnership, a nonprofit that aims to improve recycling rates but has seen its mission compromised by the confusion over new policies that aim to capitalize on certain types of recyclables when rates rise. The organization launched the “largest recycling campaign in history” last fall in response to the US recycling crisis.

But, instead of trying to reverse the trend, Joyce reports that US shipments of plastic waste are being redirected to other Southeast Asian countries, including Malaysia and Thailand.

“Recycling experts say it’s a time of reckoning for their industry and that wealthy countries need to stop exporting to countries that can’t handle it,” Joyce writes.

Indeed, as the executive director of Recycling Partnership, Keefe Harrison, acknowledged recently, “In many ways, after decades of effort, the US recycling system is barely more than the sum of its thousands of parts, delivering a frustratingly low 30ish percent recycling rate. When it comes to oceans and the health of our planet…That. Will. Not. Work.”

Given the scale of the climate crisis, it’s easy to see why thinking bigger—à la the Green New Deal—is catching on. (See also: Housing policy is climate policy; foreign policy is climate policy; etc.)

NPQ has covered an emerging economic framework called the circular economy that goes beyond the “out-of-sight, out-of-mind” thinking that recycling has fostered in the wealthier countries. In part, it focuses on conservation—designing waste and pollution out of production systems —and reuse—that is, keeping existing materials in use or repurposing them.

Further, companies can be held accountable for the waste created by manufactured products. For example, a new shopping platform called Loop operates like a 21st-century milk delivery service to deliver your laundry detergent and shampoo in reusable, returnable containers.

However, David Wallace-Wells, author of The Uninhabitable Earth: Life after Warming, recently reframed the recycling mindset on the podcast Still Processing, arguing that political action is more critical than conscious consumption. It will take political action, for instance, to enforce labeling of “carbon neutral” products, just as it did to get the US Department of Agriculture “organic” program approved by Congress nearly three decades ago.

Taking the idea one step further, how could nonprofits embrace a “carbon-neutral” badge of honor? Could employees’ transportation be measured and offset? Could organizations commit to radically reducing cross-country travel to conferences? Could human services organizations advocate for local policies on renewable energy with fervor equal to the national struggle against the elimination of the charitable deduction for donors? The time is now, so let us know what you think.—Anna Berry",United States,2019.03
432,"Odyssey Innovation Makes Kayaks Out Of Sea Plastic, Uses Kayaks To Collect More","Rob Thompson wants to teach big business a thing or two about the circular economy. Thompson runs a startup that collects discarded plastic from the ocean, along with used fishing nets from commercial anglers. The plastic and nets are used to make kayaks, and the kayaks are used to help harvest more ocean plastic. His company, Odyssey Innovation, sells kayaks made from recycled marine plastic for a small profit.

""For me, part of the solution could be people realizing the value of plastic,"" Thompson says.

He's talking about plastic waste that washes into coves in his part of Cornwall, England. Five years ago, Thompson began collecting plastic from remote coves where he went kayaking, later enlisting a volunteer group of divers to assist.

The effort took off from there. As the kayak harvests continued, he started collecting old fishing nets and gear from local anglers, working with a group called Keep Britain Tidy.

Today he runs a Paddle for Plastic campaign with kayaks, part of a deal with kayak manufacturer Palm Equipment to give back to the community.

Thompson says he doesn't make money on the recycling, but tries to make money at the end of the process, by selling recycled plastic kayaks for 10% above cost.

Plastic and fish nets collected by his operation are trucked to a plant in Denmark for processing, then sent to Palm Equipment, where one- and two-seat kayaks are made.

Odyssey Innovation started selling the kayaks in January. The basic model goes for about $600 U.S.

About 100 have been sold through Palm Equipment, Thompson says.

""It seems to be going OK. I don't know if I'm going to make my fortune. That wasn't really the intention anyway. The intention was trying to find a solution ... I think that using business could be a real solution to the plastic pollution problem.""

Even today, ""it's ridiculously easy"" to find plastic in his part of England, Thompson says. ""There's just so much material out there.""

He says most of the plastic products that he and others find on beaches have recycling labels on them. He hopes projects like his help show the value of plastic and that it shouldn't be discarded.

""It's absolutely crazy, in a society, that you end up with a resource causing an environmental problem.""",United States,2019.03
433,"Secondhand Could Supplant Fast Fashion in a Decade, ThredUp & The RealReal Are Leading the Way","My wife and I recently drove from Minneapolis to Chicago to visit our youngest daughter, who is in PR and social media marketing, she is also a life-long fashionista. So besides hitting a few of Chicago’s many terrific eateries, we indulged in some retail therapy; primarily in the trendy Wicker Park neighborhood. For those not familiar with this area, it’s a magnet for GenY professionals, and has a rich mix of upscale indie retailers, digital native brands, and an unexpectedly large offering of resale and consignment stores.

It became clear to me that much of what I’d been reading about the ‘second hand economy’ was alive and thriving here. Also, the notion that this segment was a one-note play on the rummage or thrift store of the past was quickly negated. A high level of merchandising and creative display made many of these stores highly engaging; and it’s clear that in watching the customers immersed in the hunt, that there is something special, even primal, going on in these highly curated shops.

While the early years of the resale market growth may have been driven by early adapters, it's fair to say the whole phenomenon has gone very mainstream. It’s been reported that in 2018, the secondhand market accounted for $28 billion, compared to $35 billion for fast fashion. However, what’s more startling is the fact that within ten years the secondhand market is expected to nearly triple, reaching $64 billion, while fast fashion is predicted to only rise to $44 billion. Not surprisingly, Gen Y’s and Gen Z’s are fueling the growth, yet Boomers are not sitting it out.

As I’ve written in the past, these kind of market fluctuations are always a result of multiple factors, or converging trends. In the case of the secondhand phenomenon, it’s impacted by a shift from top-down style influence, which used to be directed by the fashion industry, to bottom-up forces, led by influencers, and social media’s encouragement to cultivate one’s personal style. The other factors at play are consumer’s increasing sustainability consciousness, and how the newly refined buy/wear/sell model enables fashion conscious consumers to change out their wardrobe easily.

Of equal importance is the fact that some major players have emerged, refining the methodology, perfecting the monetization model, and turbocharging the trend. One of the parties responsible for the 56 million women who bought secondhand products in 2018 is ThredUp. They experienced an 80% increase in demand for their “Clean Out Kits” after Netflix’s first airing of Marie Kondo’s show. According to ThredUp’s, 2019 Resale Report, over half of retail-resale customers also expect to spend more over the next five years. In fact, it’s altering the way consumers even think about their clothing purchases.

Research suggests that customers are now thinking of their clothing as a ‘tradable asset’, which is influencing buying decisions around the secondhand (or thirdhand) value of their purchases. Additionally, trending suggests that with this new mindset consumers are reducing the number of items in their closets at the same time they are swapping out their wardrobe more frequently. This is fed by the fact that ThredUp is listing 30,000 new items each day – take that, fast fashion.

This new circular economy has no socio-economic boundaries, in fact the RealReal has been selling luxury consignment online, since its 2011 inception. CEO Julie Wainwright set out to change the perceptions of what luxury resale could be and has managed to raise $288 million to build her stealth web phenomenon, which now also includes two stores and nine drop-off point. Her brands include Stella McCartney, Alexander McQueen, Versace, Rolex, Cartier, and Patek Philippe. Additionally, the online store extended beyond fashion, to include home furnishings.

Beyond just offering the luxury goods a second life The RealReal has taken their role of authentication and restoration very seriously. Wainwright employs gemologists, watchmakers and brand authenticators to guarantee both product authenticity and correct restoration when warranted. Additionally, the company offers free expert evaluation of their customer’s luxury goods. Welcome to fashion's new circular economy.",United States,2019.03
437,AFPM '19: INSIGHT: Petrochemicals growth could slow down sharply on circularity - Accenture,"SAN ANTONIO (ICIS)--Thinking about the petrochemicals industry in terms of demand, from emerging and developed economies, then the world seems set fair.

Advanced, industrial societies generate a certain level of petrochemicals demand as industrial and economic growth provide the backbone on which chemicals demand of all sorts is built.

Developing economies provide the greatest growth for petrochemicals as industries develop and consumers become wealthier and can, on the face of it, consume more.

The growth projections from the major petrochemical players and now, increasingly, from the crude oil majors, pivot on their interpretation of developing economic growth.

In the short term, that means the global economy over this year and next. Longer term, it relies on demographics and a take on core industrial development and economic expansion.

“On the surface, today’s chemical industry looks good,” a 2019 chemicals sector report by consultancy Accenture said.

“But delve deeper and week-by-week hidden pressures are mounting, revealing telltale signs of risk.""

Productivity improvements have been hard to come by. On the other hand, margins have been squeezed by “long, shallow"" cycles.

Rapid growth cycles, driven by emerging economies, are petering out, while merger and acquisitions (M&A) have little impact on core industry fundamentals, Accenture said.

Materials replacement is becoming harder for industry players as consuming markets mature.

'COMPRESSIVE DISRUPTION'

 And there are clear threats as downstream consuming industries, much closer to the end market than chemical players can ever be – or ever want to be – react to fundamental market changes: circularity, greater volatility, shifting market demand, like with combustion-engine driven automobiles, for example.

“Our research shows that while chemical companies are not necessarily in great danger from imminent big bang disruption, the industry is exposed to the ongoing threat of growth and profit erosion,” Accenture said.

“It’s a silent but deadly slow deterioration of performance that creeps up on companies in asset-heavy industries over the years, opening the door to disruptive forces.

""We call this compressive disruption, where the business stagnates, incumbents lose control and new entrants can take the advantage.”

Every chemical company is aware of this: the threat to markets; the arrival of the new; the shifting power battles that could see their markets swamped.

When you are wedded to a significant asset base, however, it is difficult to move fast and the steps you take will necessarily be expensive, possibly disruptive, and will not be taken lightly.

Accenture warned of a false sense of security and situations in which changes in performance can be seen as normal ups and downs.

CIRCULARITY

 Top of the agenda for plastics producers has to be the circular economy. Mandated levels of recycling are one thing. Another is the way in which consuming companies – the retailers and others that determine which plastics are used in which products and packaging, and where – change their usage and buying patterns.

The latest research on the topic from Accenture emphasised that while the petrochemical industry is a high-growth, basic-materials business, growing faster than energy, it faces a significant, specific challenge.

The circular economy could blow a hole in growth projections that underpin the businesses of the world’s major plastics producers and the ambitions of the crude oil majors to shift significantly more towards chemicals and away from transport fuels.

Many of those companies look to above-GDP growth rates for plastics, based on rising income levels and a growing middle class in the world’s developing economies.

Accenture’s research, however, undertaken on an energy-equivalence basis, suggests that petrochemicals growth rates could be reduced by half to less than 1.5% year out to 2024 by the impacts of the circular economy.

That would amount to the loss of 275m tonnes of lost conventional plastics production capacity.",United States,2019.03
438,How Entrepreneur Andrea Rasca Will Grow His Own Vegetables To Get The Quality At A Price He Demands,"A farm on the roof of a new community food market will produce enough fresh vegetables and herbs to feed 100,000 diners in east London. And at a third of their usual price in supermarkets.

Mercato Ilford, the third venue in London run by operator Mercato Metropolitano will open on a former car park behind Ilford town hall in October this year. Thirty food stalls and seating for 600 people will take up the ground floor with the farm covering the entire roof.

Andrea Rasca, the founder and CEO, has opened food markets in the U.K. and Italy, each one offering food from a range of cultures and countries and produced organically.

The business model, only four years old, is about to roll out in France and Japan soon while Rasca meets three city mayors in the U.S. this week. It follows a crowdfunded raise via Seedrs in 2017.

Mercato Ilford, along with a business hub for food startups and a workspace for artists, is part of a cultural quarter in the centre of Redbridge, one of London’s outer boroughs.

Its food offer will include Mediterranean restaurants, Middle Eastern grills, pan-Asian food and low-packaging grocery stores. Concessions are even audited weekly to ensure that they meet the operator’s guidelines on sourcing and manufacturing.

Cooking classes open to the community will provide local residents with the opportunity to learn how to make meals.

The building, won in competition with six other architects by Interrobang, has been designed to operate with zero-waste with a circular economy model recovering and regenerating where possible.

“It’s a market selling aubergines, it’s not a temple,” says Rasca of the simple timber structure.

The rooftop farm, using 1200 sq m of hydroponics, will produce 60-80 tonnes of mixed vegetables a year – largely leaves such as lettuce and spinach – retailing to diners at around £8 per kilo, compared to around £25 per kilo in supermarkets.

To put the harvest into some kind of context “we will easily provide fruit or salad in a good portion for around 100,000 people, probably around 20% of what we need,” says Rasca.

Redbridge Council, working with the Greater London Authority and London Enterprise Partnership, attracted funding for the regeneration project of which £1.4 million be used to fund the Ilford market.

Rasca never thinks of himself as a leader – “I just have ideas” – but he has thought about food since he was six years old.

“I wanted to go to the market to buy food rather than toys.”

After studying business at university in Italy, he won a two-year scholarship to Japan funded by the EU. It was there that he finally got to convert his passion into his business, setting up Eataly Japan, a consultancy helping Italians export food to Japan.

“I am not a salesperson. My thought was how can I transport taste to another country? You market food by getting people to taste it,” says Rasca.

It was not just about tasting good. What also drives Rasca is the desire to offer good quality but affordable food.

“Our aim is to go back to the idea that food is adequate and accessible and it respects local traditions,” is how Rasca puts it.

He wants Mercato Metropolitan to play a part in fighting the obesity crisis, challenging a system whereby good quality food too often equals expensive food, making the victims of the crisis more likely to be those with lower income.

The prototype for the food market started off with a bang in 2015 with an enormous, 14,000 sqm pop-up serving eight million people during the Milan Expo.

Its first London market launched in a former paper factory near London’s Elephant & Castle in 2016. The market attracts up to 60,000 people a week to a part of the city that previously had little or no footfall

Rasca’s favourites include German Kraft Beer (“Meisters of Purity”), a traditional Bavarian craft beer produced by a German student at Kings College London that generated £1.7 million last year.

And Nancy Nosel, another German who worked with Mercato Metropolitano’s executive chef Gabriele Bagni to turn her idea for traditional German dumplings into reality and learn how to run a food business. Her concession, Ze Spatzle, is now turning over £10,000 per month in a 1.5 m sq stand.

Revenue totalled £9 million in 2017, £15.2 million in 2018 and is projected to rise to £32 million, including the new openings, in 2019 at a margin of 30%.

Along with Ilford, another market is due to open in the former St Mark’s church in London’s Mayfair, in partnership with developers Grosvenor, and in South London’s Elephant Park a new venue will sit beside a bread making plant, with developers Lendlease.

Paris and Tokyo have already signed deals for their own. And Rasca is due in the U.S. this week to discuss similar projects with the mayors of Atlanta, Harlem and Miami.

“We wanted to prove a model, make money and invest in new ideas, people and the community without banks, sponsors or advertisers,” says Rasca.",United States,2019.03

440,Save water in pursuit of a better world | World Water Day,"The commercial and institutional sector is the second largest consumer of publicly supplied water in the US, accounting for the withdrawal of over 15.9 billion gallons of water per day. Fortunately, businesses are also working to decrease this number each year, by focusing on long-term solutions and building regenerative value chains.

Responsible water use: good for the environment, good for business

Water is crucial to supporting life on Earth, as well as the development of truly sustainable societies – but our water supply is affected by pollution, climate change, overuse, scarcity and countless other issues. Therefore, as part of its 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development, the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water for all.

Based on this SDG, last week’s World Water Day brought attention to the importance of freshwater and advocacy for the sustainable management of freshwater resources, reminding businesses to take a closer look at conservation efforts. This is an opportunity for businesses to step up and embed more sustainable practices in their supply chains – not only to help the environment, but to meet the demand of consumers who are increasingly changing their consumption habits to reduce their impact on the environment.

Specifically, recycled paper and packaging can be a gateway to sustainability for businesses. Green America estimates that in the creation of paper products, moving from virgin to recycled manufacturing creates 43% less wastewater. Recycled fiber products require 9 times less water to produce, so it’s important to look for the right supply chain partners to help your business move the needle.

Water is used throughout the entire manufacturing process to carry fibers through the production system. Here is how that happens, and what to look for when building a sustainable supply chain:
• Machinery – Efficient machinery is key to responsible water use. For example, our equipment uses less water than standard processes because of the machinery’s significantly higher horsepower than typical recycling mills. The nine-ton spindle rotor turning within our fiber pulper heats up water by one degree every two minutes.
• Water reuse – Additionally, water used to clean and help break down fibers throughout the production process is collected in large tanks called “clarifiers,” where it is cleaned and reused. For our production, one gallon of water can be re-used eight times before moving to an onsite effluent treatment plant These savings contribute to our product’s low environmental impact, which uses nine times less water to produce than virgin fiber, as reported in our third-party LCA.
• Chemicals – It’s also important to pay attention to chemicals used throughout the process. For example, our wastewater also undergoes a treatment process that reduces COD (chemical oxygen demand) by over 80% before it is released back to water bodies.

Still, it’s imperative for businesses to continue working to reduce their rate of water usage year-over-year. One way to ensure continuous improvement is by empowering employees to find solutions and embrace the company’s sustainability mission. To truly embed sustainability in its DNA, a company can make environmental stewardship a priority from the inside out, starting with its employees.

Our De Pere, Wisconsin mill completed a water saving initiative spearheaded by production superintendent Phil Nysse, which resulted in a minimum of 100 gallons per minute of fresh water saved. After noticing a sweating pipe, Phil and the Sustana Fiber team found a way to divert cold water from pipes near the end of our production line to the plant’s cold-water supply, resulting in water savings of just under 8% per ton of fiber produced between 2016 and 2018.

Clearly, individuals can make a huge difference in saving our precious resources, and when they work with businesses, we can find a common understanding of how circular economy principles can be applied to sustainable water management and truly move the needle. In recognition of World Water Day, businesses must do their part to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water for all by 2030. Through measurement, transparency and innovation, we can build sustainable supply chains that lead to sustainable manufacturing, aligned with the circular economy model.

442,HP Canada CEO & President Mary Ann Yule Explains Why Being Green Is Good For Your Bottom Line,"Sustainability is one of HP’s untold stories. At HP Reinvent 2019, HP Canada President and CEO Mary Ann Yule shared the latest ways HP is focused on the environment and the impacts that she says go far beyond “being green.”

How is HP differentiating itself in the tech space?

We do a lot of work on the planet to really make sure that we make positive impact. We work with paper suppliers to make forest positive paper so that it’s not negative to the forestry. We also make sure our cartridges come from fully recycled environments, so that we are recycling plastics and have a circular economy around it. And, it’s so much more important now as we see millennials and Gen Z join the workforce. This community of workers and soon to be leaders are much more committed to sustainability. They will automatically go - OK, HP is doing great work around this. They can rest assured that they have a trusted partner in HP.

Security is another big theme at HP Reinvent this year. How is HP making it easier for partners to succeed in this space with its latest security announcements?

Security is paramount. There’s nobody who is not worried about security. We developed the most secure, manageable PCs on earth, the most secure printers on earth. We are the only print manufacturer who can say that. These are fact-based statements. We have to make sure our customers can feel safe and they can continue to run their business and feel safe. We protect them so it’s not a concern for them.

What else are you excited to share from the conference?

Our partners are all looking to transform to perform, which is our theme for the conference. But, they’re all in because our end partners are also looking to transform to perform and to compete in the markets they service. It’s exciting that it’s resonating, and they are understanding we are all in with that message with our investments, partner community, tools and processes, technology, products that we are developing and reinventing, so that’s really exciting for me.",United States,2019.03
445,5 Ways to Reinvent Your Business through the Circular Economy,"You can help the planet and your business at the same time.

We are living in a time of unprecedented progress. The average consumer today leads a life rivaling royalty during the 19th century. There are more of us, we are living longer — and we are all consuming more goods, even in remote places of the planet.

But progress has come at a price.

Global warming, resource depletion and pollution threaten to derail the tremendous progress from the past century. According to Circle Economy, a consultancy, we reuse just 9 percent of materials consumed globally.

Even in the European Union, a leader in environmental protection, only 40 percent of total waste is recycled. Our hyper-charged consumption is even starting to lower our quality of life. According to the United Nations, 9 out of 10 people breathe polluted air every day.

Hence the need for a new economy, a circular one.

A linear economy focuses on the build-use-discard approach, but a circular economy taps into a reuse and recycle system.

It’s not just about producing and consuming less but also producing and consuming in a smart way so everyone can benefit from our shared resources in a sustainable way.

The circular economy unlocks the potential of our resources through innovative business models, leading to sustainable solutions that transform everyday life.

Here are five ways the circular economy can help companies grow, reduce costs and innovate.

When developing new products, try to make them energy efficient and longer lasting. At the same time, use standardized components that are easy to disassemble, repair, recycle and upgrade.

Create contracts based on service instead of selling. With trade-in programs that extend use of the product with customers and secondary markets, this shifts the transactional purchase of a product to a long-term relationship with customers.

Before throwing a product away, consider repairing it. Logistics companies like UPS have critical parts fulfillment networks that can deliver parts same or next business day so service technicians can make on-site equipment repairs.

Easy returns are not only convenient for your customers but often allow your business to quickly understand the reason for the return. This information can help you decide whether to resell an item, repair it or dispose it before it leaves the customer’s hands.

Companies like Optoro help optimize returns so your business minimizes financial loss.

They route returns and excess inventory to secondary markets where it can be resold, donated or recycled.

While the world is moving fast, slow down and look at your traditional business processes through a circular lens.

We find innovation and opportunity in unexpected places, which might help you rethink your relationship with customers, suppliers and the environment.

447,"Eni, CNR create R&D partnership for energy sector decarbonization","LECCE, Italy -- Massimo Inguscio, president of the Italian National Research Council (CNR), and Claudio Descalzi, Eni CEO, following their meeting held last May, have signed a Joint Research Agreement (JRA), to set up four linked research centers in southern Italy. Also, in attendance were Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Minister for Southern Italy Barbara Lezzi and the President of the Apulia Region, Michele Emiliano. At the operational and research centers, lab researchers will work in four key areas, all crucial to the decarbonization of the energy sector, sustainable growth, promoting the circular economy and bioeconomy, innovative and sustainable water systems and agricultural techniques. The four key areas are:
• Magnetic confinement for the creation of clean fusion energy, in Gela;
• Sustainable and innovative management of the water cycle, in Basilicata;
• Agricultural methods with lower CO emissions, in Portici.

All the centers will have laboratories dedicated to these research projects. The objectives, activities and resources will be defined and agreed upon by Eni and CNR.

The joint research conducted by the Eni-CNR laboratory at the CNR Nanotec Institute in Lecce is dedicated to analyzing and quantifying climate processes linked to the destabilization of the Arctic cryosphere, in particular the permafrost and the effects of it melting into the Arctic Ocean. These processes are extremely significant. They could increase the current rate of global warming and reduce environmental quality. Eni and CNR's joint effort has led to the first Italian laboratory for the integrated study of the Arctic cryosphere. It will take measurements in the field, make satellite observations and use numerical modelling.

The Ettore Maiorana Eni-CNR center for fusion energy in Gela will carry out cutting-edge research on the properties of plasma, superconducting magnets and power plants that exploit the material properties and advantages of fusion. The center will work on methods for transporting and storing electric power, communicating with other CNR centers already working in Sicily in these fields. The Eni-CNR joint project will also develop technological skills and knowledge of innovative techniques and validation methods for fusion energy. It will do so by leveraging Eni’s expertise at the CNR research centres of excellence.

The Acqua Eni-CNR centre in Metaponto will develop scientific knowledge and promote innovative solutions and technologies for using water more productively and efficiently in agriculture, as well as mitigating the growing impact of drought in the Mediterranean and other strategic areas like the Horn of Africa, the Sahel and the Middle East.

Projects aimed at promoting the circular economy will be carried out as part of CNR's agricultural research in Portici. They will specifically involve studying decarbonization efforts in the agricultural industry, as well as how biomass waste can be used as a raw material for producing biofuels in Eni's bio-refineries. At the same time, there will be studies and projects to increase the development of sustainable agriculture that uses land for a variety of purposes and involves planting a wider range of crops. These methods support the bioeconomy, in keeping with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals and EU research programs on the bioeconomy and agri-food.

Eni CEO, Claudio Descalzi, comments: “This collaboration with CNR is part of Eni's strategy of close cooperation with Italy's excellent research institutions. We are proud to have nine active strategic agreements with some of the country's top universities and research bodies and to have invested over $73.58 million (67 million euros), demonstrating our commitment to the field of research and development.”

 

CNR President, Massimo Inguscio, says: “The agreement between Eni and CNR is a unique example of a partnership between a major company and Italy's most important research body in terms of numbers of researchers, patents and ERC prizes. It will allow us to create synergy between the mutual skills in the joint laboratories in Italy. This partnership will produce innovations in research and technology on an industrial scale in the south, to the benefit of all of Italy and world wild. CNR and Eni researchers will work together on the four key areas relating to decarbonization in the energy sector, promoting the circular economy and bioeceonomy, and supporting more efficient water systems and innovative agricultural techniques. This is in keeping with the key Sustainable Development Goals outlined in the UN's 2030 Agenda. At the same time, it will also promote solutions for and help mitigate the growing impact of drought in the Mediterranean and strategic areas like the Horn of Africa, the Sahel and the Middle East.”

450,OMV Turns Austrian Airlines Plastic Cups Into Synthetic Crude Oil,"Amid growing global concern about the overuse of plastic, Austria’s oil and gas group OMV and Austrian Airlines have partnered to turn the plastic cups the airline’s passengers have used into synthetic crude that could be later processed into fuels or other plastic products.

OMV said on Friday that it had started to process used plastic disposable cups from Austrian Airlines into synthetic crude at a pilot plant that uses a process known as thermal cracking.

OMV’s ReOil pilot plant heats the plastic to over 400 degrees Celsius, and under this temperature the molecules of the plastic are cracked to produce synthetic crude oil.

“It would be better if we could convert old plastic into synthetic oil and use this resource either for producing new plastics or as energy for mobility. That would give us a circular economy for plastics, similar to paper,” says Wolfgang Hofer, Senior Expert New Technology, OMV Schwechat Refinery.

The whole chain of converting plastic into synthetic crude oil goes like this: Austrian Airlines flight attendants collect plastic separately, a disposal company cleans and shreds the plastic cups and then sends them to the OMV ReOil plant, where the plastic is heated and turned into synthetic crude.

According to OMV, 100 kilograms of used plastics can produce 100 liters of synthetic crude.

“The exceptional properties of plastic as a material mean make it hard to imagine life without it. In the ReOil pilot plant, we are able to turn the AUA drinking cups into synthetic crude and then process them into fuel or back into plastics,” Thomas Gangl, OMV Senior Vice President Refining & Petrochemicals, said in today’s statement.

Airlines don’t have much of a choice in the fuel they use, as jet fuel is produced from oil, but many airlines have started to limit the use of plastic. American Airlines eliminated plastic straws in July 2018 and started to serve drinks with a biodegradable, eco-friendly straw and wood stir stick. Delta Air Lines said in October 2018 that it was working on removing single-use plastics onboard and in Delta Sky Clubs.

451,Austrian Airlines turns plastic cups into crude oil,"Austrian Airlines has revealed that it has teamed up with oil and gas company OMV to turn the single-use plastic drinking cups used onboard its aircraft into synthetic crude.

The programme has been under way since January, with flight attendants separating plastic cups from other waste since the end of 2018.

A disposal company collects the cups to clean and shred them then delivers the plastic to OMV’s ReOil pilot plant at the Schwechat Refinery in Austria. The plastic is then turned into synthetic crude through a process called thermal cracking.

Crude produced by this process is then turned into fuel or other raw materials for the plastics industry.

Austrian Airlines says this recycling initiative is part of its support of a ‘circular economy’ that conserves resources and is more environmentally friendly.

Vera Renner, VP of cabin operations for Austrian Airlines, commented: “Austrian Airlines is consistently striving to reduce waste on board our flights. Our flight attendants have been making a key contribution for many years by recycling. I am delighted that – together with OMV – we have been able to take another crucial step towards this goal on the initiative of the crew members from the Austrian Airlines ‘Fly greener’ team.”

Thomas Gangl, senior VP of refining and petrochemicals for OMV, added: “The exceptional properties of plastic as a material make it hard to imagine life without it. In the ReOil plant, we are able to turn the AUA drinking cups into synthetic crude and then process them into fuel or back into plastics. Our OMV research project allows us to close the circle and reduce waste.

452,How can Tibet ensure sustainable development?,"Editor's note: Yang Tao, Ph.D. in Economics, Associate Researcher of China Tibetology Research Center, specializes in the economic development of Tibetan area. The article reflects the author's opinion, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

In 2018, Tibet's GDP growth rate has reached about 10 percent, ranking the highest in the country. The per capita net income of farmers and herdsmen has increased from 5,697 yuan in 2012 to 10,330 yuan in 2017. The per capita disposable income of urban residents has increased to 30,671 yuan in 2017, a 10.3 percent increase on a year-on-year basis.

At the same time, the Tibet Autonomous Region has actively improved its approach to growth by pursuing green development. For example, when it comes to industrial structure, the share of its green industries, led by tourism and clean energy, continues to grow.

On the one hand, Tibet undertakes important missions of the country as a national ecological barrier, a priority of the border security strategy and a major gateway to South Asia in China's Belt and Road Initiative. On the other hand, Tibet faces a series of challenges such as its relatively early stage of social development, weak foundation for economic development, low market economy awareness, underdeveloped market systems as well as the wide development gap between Tibet and other parts of the country.

Therefore, in order to promote long-term stability and development in Tibet, China's central government needs to enable the autonomous region to create growth by itself while providing aid and improving its development sustainability in the following aspects.

For starters, the policy of aiding Tibet should continue. Despite the rapid economic growth, the region still lags behind other parts of the country, especially when compared with the more developed eastern part of China.

Besides, a dual approach of providing aid and creating self-development ability is a must for Tibet. The ultimate goal of aid is to enhance Tibet's ability to develop by itself, not to create reliance on aid. Therefore, given the current slowdown in the growth rates of national economy and fiscal revenue, it is necessary to combine aid with efforts to create self-driven growth.

Comparisons should be made between Tibet and other parts of China and the rest of the world to find the competitive advantages of Tibet and identify promising industries; in this regard, distinctive industries such as tourism, clean energy, eco-friendly food and beverages produced on the plateau, Tibetan medicine, and ethnic arts and crafts should be promoted. And more efforts should be made to help local Tibetan companies and entrepreneurs grow and create a brand name effect for Tibetan products, businesses and merchants.

In addition, China's central government needs to strike a balance between aid to Tibet and environmental protection. Given its valuable ecological resources and its role in the country's environmental efforts, Tibet must seek sustainable and green development. Environmentally friendly industries should be given priority in industrial development, such as eco-tourism and clean energy. Promoting a circular economy and building industrial parks are also needed. Tibet should also take advantage of its natural resources to expand eco-friendly industries and develop carbon sink economy.

Last but not least, improving people's livelihood is the starting mission of the aid work. It is of great significance to people-centered development and national unity. China's central government will continue to prioritize grassroots-level projects and programs designed to improve people's livelihood in the allocation of aid funds.

And Tibetan farmers and herdsmen should be encouraged to participate in the design and implementation of aid projects and enabled to share the benefits of aid projects, which will contribute to the improving living standard of the people there, and thus helping realize the goal of long-term stability and prosperity.",United States,2019.03
455,Cork’s ‘green bus’ to make maiden trip to Ringaskiddy,"Ireland’s move towards reducing carbon emissions will move a step closer on Monday when passengers will make their first journey on a “green bus” during a trial run from Cork city centre to Ringaskiddy.

Minister for Transport Shane Ross said the trial with passengers aboard is on a bus fuelled by biomethane, recovered through anaerobic digestion which not only generates energy but also supports a more circular economy through the use of waste as a resource.

“The most important transformation in transport will be the replacement of conventionally fossil-fuelled vehicles with cleaner more efficient alternatives,” he said. “This is a formidable adjustment but one that with vision, investment and resilience can set Ireland on the right path to decarbonisation and cleaner air.”

The trial run, support by Energy Cork and Cork Chamber, who have campaigned for a move to alternatively fuelled technologies, will mean the bus collects passengers at Lapp’s Quay in Cork and brings them to the Marine and Renewable Energy Ireland centre in Ringaskiddy.

Mr Ross said last year that Ireland would no longer purchase traditional diesel fuel public buses after June 2019 and the Government has been seeking alternatives.

456,"KT for Good: UAE vows to turn the plastic tide, how about you?","The world is waking up to a crisis created by what was once dubbed a 'miracle product'. Countries are now taking concerted actions to reverse the plastic trend - and the UAE has been doing its bit to reduce plastic waste.

Calling plastic pollution a 'monumental environmental challenge', Yousif Al Rayssi, director of the municipal affairs department at the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MoCCAE), recognised that the scale of the problem has already reached the tipping point. For one, marine and terrestrial animals have been dying either from suffocation or starvation as they mistake plastics for food.

Studies have shown that the plastic industry is ""thriving"" at an alarming rate in the GCC, Al Rayyasi said.

""According to the Gulf Petrochemicals and Chemicals Association, the UAE has the fastest-growing plastic industry in the GCC region at over 24 per cent per annum in the past decade.

""Given its paramount importance in everyday life, there is a huge demand for plastic among individuals as well as industrial and commercial sectors. Therefore, in a bid to reduce plastic waste, the UAE government exerts considerable efforts to ensure the smart use and disposal of plastic products,"" he added.

To tackle the root cause of the plastic problem, the government is taking measures to move towards a ""plastic-circular economy"" and adopt eco-friendly waste management solutions, Al Rayssi told Khaleej Times.

""We realised the dire need to protect the environment against the adverse effects of plastic waste through opting for greener choices,"" he said. And according to the national agenda, the country targets to divert 75 per cent of its municipal solid waste from landfills by 2021, Al Rayassi added.

A number of legislations have been introduced to mitigate plastic pollution, including Cabinet Resolution No. 40 of 2009, which sets a mandatory standard for plastic bags and other biodegradable plastic products.

""The MoCCAE passed Ministerial Resolution No. 118 of 2013, obliging manufacturers and suppliers of plastic products to register biodegradable plastic products at the Emirates Conformity Assessment Scheme (ECAS).

Also, according to Federal Law No. 24 of 1999 for the protection and development of the environment, dumping any waste in our seas and oceans is illegal,"" Al Rayssi said.

In December 2018, the President, His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, issued Federal Law No. 12 of 2018 on integrated waste management, which seeks to transform waste from an environmental concern into a source of income in accordance with best practices. The law tackles the entire waste life cycle - from its production, segregation and collection, down to its transportation, storage, reuse, recycling, treatment and disposal.

The country has also been systematically monitoring waste generation to ensure its effective management, Al Rayyasi said.

""Realising that efficient and effective waste management requires valid data, the MoCCAE has developed the electronic National Waste Database that tracks the generation and treatment of all types of waste across the UAE, and it is accessible to all local departments concerned.""

Launched in 2018, the National Waste Database lists out the amount of waste generated, the treatment methods used, and how much of waste has been treated in each emirate. Results will then be compared with national targets and global indicators.

Several waste-to-energy facilities are also under construction, and these are expected to boost the ministry's efforts to keep all kinds of waste away from landfills, Al Rayyasi said.

The fight against plastic waste goes beyond putting rules and regulations in place. It's a problem that can be totally solved only if everyone in the community does their share.

""We believe that to deal with the plastic waste challenge in an effective manner, we must educate and engage the public. Therefore, we have been running awareness campaigns about the smart use and disposal of plastic.

""The campaigns have focused on promoting green habits and applying the principle of the 3Rs - reduce, reuse and recycle."" The ministry has also organised coastal clean-up drives.

Early this year, the MoCCAE hosted the Climate Forum at the World Government Summit in Dubai. The event featured plastic pollution discussions that were led by environmental advocates.

Under the theme 'Beat Plastic Pollution', the MoCCAE has engaged private businesses in the anti-plastic drive. As part of the initiative, LuLu Group International, Aster DM Healthcare, Apparel Group, BRS Ventures and many other firms pledged to bring down the plastic waste numbers across their operations.

""The success of each of the initiatives that tackle plastic waste represents a small victory within the bigger global picture.

""Repeated achievements and incremental gains by all stakeholders will eventually result in turning the tide on plastic pollution,"" Al Rayssi said.",United States,2019.03
457,Cres and Susak Show Why Sheep and Olives Work Well Together,"As is the case with many Mediterranean countries, the relationship between olives and the Croatian coast runs deep, it is a story that would take all the time in the world to tell and it boasts a plethora of different personal meanings for many individuals and their families.

Olives and the coast go hand in hand and the entire practice of olive picking has well and truly withstood the test of time and the various winds of change that time has brought with it over the many centuries that have passed. Skills and knowledge are passed down through generations, and traditions are upheld through time.

Despite the modern world in which we're increasingly being dragged feet first into, many families along the Croatian coast, from the extreme south of Dalmatia to the Kvarner region, bring things to a standstill when ''olive time'' comes along. During that special time of year, families are bonded again and again through the picking of the olives, and the work that follows.

As Morski writes on the 22nd of March, 2019, the northern Adriatic islands of Cres and Susak were presented at the fourth International Congress on the revitalisation of terraced landscapes in the Canaries.

Dr. Goran Andlar from the Faculty of Agriculture in Zagreb and Tanja Kremenić from Cres who is currently doing her PhD in Padua discussed the terraced landscape of the Croatian island of Cres, which embodies a kind of olive and sheep cooperation, writes the portal Otoci.net.

''The olive-sheep model was a very interesting component of the presentation to the public, and we take it for granted, it's natural to us. Sheep are natural fertilisers, they're natural cleansers of excess vegetation and they're bred extensively so they does not represent any sort of big extra effort for humans. Why is it so important that we preserve terraced landscapes?

If they're not used, there is a risk of erosion and a loss of fertile anthropogenic soil. They are also very important today because they represent an alternative to mechanised high-intensive agriculture and are an example of the implementation of pertinent concepts of development such as ""sustainable development"" or the ""circular economy"" in reality, but here on the ground,'' stated Tanja Kremenić.

At one congress back in 2016, which was held in Padua, the beautiful island of Cres presented this charming sheep-inspired theme with a poster, and then a one-day trip to the island of Cres was organised for the participants of the congress.

460,Ireland pressing on in the war on single use plastic,"The war on single-use plastic has begun in earnest in Ireland with businesses, environmental groups, and a prominent GAA club joining the battle to cut its use. Building material group, Kingspan, has partnered with a foundation that removes plastic from the ocean and plans to reuse as much of the plastic recovered as it can in the production of insulation products.

Friends of the Earth has partnered with Voice Ireland to empower communities to take action on single-use plastics while Youghal GAA has joined forces with Refill Ireland to encourage the use of reusable water bottles.

Kingspan plans to use 500m recycled plastic bottles a year in its insulation products by 2023. The three-year partnership with the EcoAlf Foundation will see it help to remove up to 150 tonnes of waste from the Mediterranean each year.

“Today’s announcement forms part of a longer-term strategy we are developing around supporting the circular economy and increasing our use of recycled materials,” said Kingspan CEO, Gene Murtagh. “With the construction industry contributing 30% of all the global waste that goes into landfill, it is vital that we find responsible ways to reduce waste at all points in the supply chain.”

Friends of the Earth and Voice Ireland have launched Sick Of Plastic, a nationwide campaign to cut the use of plastics. Pointing out that Irish companies, shops and households generate twice the EU average of plastic waste, the organisations want a nationwide deposit-return scheme, a tax on single-use cups and a ban on single-use plastics. They are also demanding that supermarkets reduce plastic packaging. Last year the campaign mobilised thousands of consumers to leave their plastic packaging behind in supermarkets in protest against single-use, non-recyclable packaging.

However, the campaigners say consumers are already doing their bit: “When the plastic bag tax was introduced in Ireland in 2001, there was a 90% drop in plastic bag use. Yet the amoung of plastic packing used in Ireland has nearly doubled in the last five years and households are left to sort it and recycle what they can. It’s not fair.”

Meanwhile, Youghal GAA has joined the environmental initiative Refill Ireland to refilling reusable water bottles at refill stations and ditch single-use plastic bottles. As a way of promoting the use of reusable water bottles, Youghal GAA is signing up to Refill Ireland to encourage club members, players, visitors and members of the public to fill their water bottles at its outdoor tap.

“When this initiative was brought to our attention we didn’t need much convincing that this is a very good idea for both the community and for our club,” said Eochaill Óg chairman, Hugh Dorrian.

“It’s a great privilege to be able to play a small part in influencing young peoples’ habits around the use of plastics. I’m delighted that Youghal GAA has stepped up to reduce plastic-bottle waste, which ultimately will help to keep Youghal streets, beaches and water free of waste plastic.’

According to Martha Doyle of Cork Environmental Forum: “People want to help stop plastic pollution, and Refill puts the power in people’s hands to do that. We are very proud that Youghal GAA is coming onboard and showing itself to be a great community leader.”",United States,2019.03
462,The Impact of Aluminum in a Circular Economy,"From automobiles to packaging to construction, manufacturing processes are evolving to reduce their ecological impact and, in turn, the footprint of final products. However, to strengthen sustainable practices, manufacturers must consider their products’ entire life cycle to make a long-term impact.

As the world’s leading vertically integrated aluminum manufacturer, Sweden-based Hydro recognizes the impact that the use of aluminum can have on emissions and energy usage, both for end customers and ourselves. Hydro has long been committed to building a more sustainable future with our customers and in the communities where we operate.

Recently, Hydro has furthered this vision with several key developments in the manufacturing of primary aluminum. Last year, we launched our state-of-the-art technology pilot at our smelter in Karmøy, Norway. Utilizing in-house electrolysis technology and advanced **artificial intelligence**, the facility is able to produce primary aluminum with the lowest energy consumption and smallest carbon dioxide footprint in the world. After a trial period, the technology will be utilized by our other smelters, as we continue to improve energy efficiency and operational stability.

At the same time, Hydro also introduced two new grades of extrusion billet (the starting stock for the extrusion process) — Hydro 4.0 and Hydro 75R — that consider both the beginning and end-of-life stages of aluminum:
• Hydro 4.0 — this billet product is certified to have maximum carbon footprint of 4 kg of CO2 per kg of aluminum. By utilizing hydroelectric power for the smelting process, Hydro 4.0 has the lowest CO2 emissions of any primary aluminum product in the world.
• Hydro 75R — this billet is made with at least 75 percent post-consumer scrap aluminum. Until recently, this level of recycled content would result in reduced quality or excessive costs. However, with Hydro’s advanced scrap shredding and sorting operation in Dormagen, Germany, the company has been able to introduce a more sustainable resource for manufacturers across many industries, particularly building and construction.

With each new product, Hydro has seen significant adoption rates by customers. The new billet products provide independently certified life cycle data without hindering the quality and performance our customers expect from Hydro products. In addition to the direct customer benefits, these products and processes will increase recycling of post-consumer scrap to 250,000 metric tons per year by 2020, reduce waste to landfill by 60 percent, and reduce water usage in water-stressed areas by 15 percent.

Demand continues to grow for products that meet these specifications, and Hydro believes long-term advantage will develop from investing in a closed-loop system, where products eventually will be recycled. As global industry moves towards a more circular economy, Hydro’s credibility and commitment to a more sustainable future place the company in a leadership role.",United States,2019.03
464,Is it possible to capitalise on the planet's interests?,"We know we have to worry on behalf of the planet and the climate, and concepts like circular economy are trying to merge the respective agendas of the finance director and environmentalist. However, it can seem like a muddy field, where the details, nuances - and not least the possibilities for action - are difficult to get an overview of.

But the fact is that the transition to a more circular economy has great benefits for both the environment and the economy, but there is a long road from thought to action. As a result, there is a need for more clarity and transparency in relation to the possibilities of optimising a product or service, where the circular economy contributes to increased earnings as well as greater environmental considerations.

Whether you are a private company, a public body or a private citizen, it can seem like complex and unmanageable decision-making processes that link the ambitions for environmental concerns with the solutions available on the market. A good place to start is our waste and the route planning it includes.

When waste is something bad

One of the biggest global challenges is the amount of waste. We produce way too much waste, and the amount of waste worldwide will explode over the coming years. According to the World Bank, the world's cities produce more than 2 billion tons of waste each year. The figure is expected to rise to 3.4 billion tons by 2050. 3.4 billion tons of waste! An alarming figure that really puts new demands on the balance between the buy-and-throw-away culture on the one hand and a closed eco-system where nothing is wasted on the other side. It is in this connection that the circular economy can become a golden bridge where both environmental and growth considerations are taken into account.

Route optimisation is a specific and proved tool with value-creating results that can satisfy the CFO as well as the CSR manager. With the right digital solution it is possible to help municipalities and waste companies with a significant saving, which also benefits the environment - and thus all of us.

The logic behind better logistics

By optimising logistics, municipalities and companies can reduce the number of kilometres they drive. There are examples of 25% reductions in CO2 emissions as well as in time spent on driving. At AMCS, we have developed a unique route optimisation system equipped with efficient optimisation algorithms, where the system can match requirements of any industry - whether it be distribution, pickup, collection or a combination of these. Fewer cars on the road mean less CO2 emissions, less administration, less driving time. Win-win-win. And with intelligent IT solutions, all companies with components in transport and logistics can achieve the obvious benefits of the circular economy - and even with improved customer service and greater delivery precision as a positive side benefit.

Circular economy in connection with transport and route optimisation is thus a sustainable economic model, which provides noticeable efficiency benefits while at the same time the company performs better on the CSR goals. By leveraging our innovation capabilities and digital skills to develop new business models, we can create a result that is both sustainable and bottom-line-oriented.",United States,2019.03
466,Manteco welcomes European Commissioner Elżbieta Bieńkowska,"European Commissioner on the Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Elżbieta Bieńkowska has been welcomed in Prato by the mayor Matteo Bittoni and by the Councilor for Productive Activities Daniela Toccafondi, together with the economic categories for a meeting organised by the Department of Economic Development.

The meeting was followed by a company visit to the headquarters of Manteco, an Italian fabrics producer. Manteco has been a leader in the production of wool and recycled fabrics since 1943. Led by Matteo and Marco Mantellassi, the company prioritises sharing economy, sustainability, internationalisation and the use of renewable energies – not only as an investment policy but also as a distinctive element for the company’s identity.

“I visited a textile company that recycles or reuses waste materials to produce wool of the highest quality: this is an excellent example of circular economy,” commented Elżbieta Bieńkowska.

“The circular economy is an extremely interesting subject everywhere in Europe, because we are leaders in sustainability, and we want our children and ourselves to be able to live in a country that is livable in the future, so that's why it is worthwhile to show stories in Europe of success like this, which is a good practice that we are putting into practice, starting with the big industries and the energy-intensive ones.”",United States,2019.03
469,Inditex Infuses MIT With Big Bucks to Fuel Green Research,"Inditex is infusing the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with $4 million to fund a multiyear research project to explore global sustainability challenges as well as promote data analysis that can be applied to business.

The research investment is part of Inditex’s long-term goals of being a sustainability leader and working to create a circular economy. “Sustainability is fully integrated into all phases of the product life cycle, including all stages of our supply chain, from design and sourcing, to manufacturing and quality control, logistics and sales through stores and online,” the company noted.

The agreement calls for Inditex to fund MIT research initiatives “relating to the circular economy and new technology associated with sustainability and the recycling of textile materials, in addition to new lines of research related to data analysis.”

The funding will include creating two data analysis fellowships at the MIT Sloan School of Management and MIT Department of Materials Science and Engineering, as well as renewing the annual scholarship program for MIT students at Inditex.

The funding was unveiled by Pablo Isla, chairman and chief executive officer of Inditex, and Rafael Reif, president of MIT. In a statement, the company said the agreement “further solidifies Inditex and MIT’s shared commitment to innovation and education following previous joint research projects focused on logistics technology, sustainability, and operations engineering.”

Félix Poza, chief sustainability officer of Inditex Group, told WWD, “At Inditex we are committed to constantly implementing the best environmental practices and taking into account the full life cycle of our products. Our $4 million investment in textile recycling and fiber innovations projects, among other environmental researches, with MIT is a prime example of that commitment, and there is evidence that our focus on sustainability is paying off.”

Regarding the return on research investment, Poza said the company’s “most sustainable product line, Join Life, grew by more than 85 percent last year and we continue to pioneer programs to drive clean chemical management in our supply chain.”

Details of the deal include earmarking $1 million specifically for the data analysis fellowships, which the company said is “to pursue pioneering initiatives in the circular economy and in the application of advanced sustainability techniques within the textiles industry.” The company also said its “Operations Research and Management Fellowship Fund” within the MIT Sloan School of Management “will receive $1 million in funding from Inditex to foster research and innovation in data analysis and prescriptive and predictive models applied to the textiles industry.”

Inditex said it will be joining the MIT Institute for Data, Systems and Society “to further research in areas such as artificial intelligence, automated learning and data science with a multiyear contribution of $1.2 million.” The company is also renewing the Leaders for Global Operations Master, which is Inditex’s scholarship program for MIT students that is backed by the MIT School of Engineering and the MIT Sloan School of Management.

“The program fosters the enhancement of technical and management skills through personalized and supervised educational experiences at Inditex’s headquarters in Arteixo, Spain,” the company said.

And lastly, the funding will include launching a new round of the MIT-Spain Inditex Sustainability Seed fund, which is for the promotion of research initiatives “between faculty members and students from MIT and their peers at universities and research institutions in Spain.” The company said the fund focuses on “areas such as new textile recycling techniques and the creation of new fibers using sustainable technology, and is endowed with $450,000 over three years.”",United States,2019.03
471,Engel optimistic despite clouds on the horizon,"The United Kingdom's pending exit from the European Union is yet another reason for uncertainty.

“Should one, must one, invest in the U.K.? Or withdraw from the U.K.? It can be compared with individual decisions everyone faces every day: Do I sell my house, buy a new car, or not, while the future is uncertain?”

By comparison, and despite the those uncertainties, the Central European countries of Germany, Austria and Switzerland (DACH) remain as before at a good level.

The U.S. has been doing well in recent years due to investment incentives such as tax reductions.

“But I am not sure how long it will continue,"" Steger said. ""Every incentive has its peak. Anyhow, U.S. converters have to consider if they are really producing efficiently, as the installed machine park is still quite old on average, compared to other world regions.”

Industry 4.0, he noted, is a further driver for investments in the U.S., as its features productivity and efficiency increases.

China, as an economic motor for other countries will grow more slowly now, if forecasts for economic growth are correct, according to Steger.

“In this respect, a Chinese entrepreneur is just as cautious as a European one and will think twice before making a new investment at the moment,” he said.

On the other hand, the Southeast Asian region can profit from U.S./China trade conflicts, also due to some production being transferred from China.

“Overall, the situation is still more like a cooling flame than a fire,"" Steger said.

In South America, according to Steger, hopes are high that the new Brazilian president will have positive impact on the region's largest economy.

While development is good in Colombia and Chile, Argentina still seems to be grappling with difficulties

And as regards Venezuela, “it is almost tragic to see that one of the oil-richest countries in the world has not managed to make a turnaround and utilize this resource to develop the economy.”

Russia is at a good business level, even with challenges in relationships between the EU and Russia.

""But I believe in Russia and its economy and therefore Engel will continue its strong presence in Russia,” Steger said.

473,3 circular plastics trends to watch | Greenbiz,"This article is drawn from the Circular Weekly newsletter from GreenBiz, running Fridays.

The conversation about plastics is officially mainstream. Every day brings a new headline about the technologies, policy changes, unlikely (or likely) collaborations or commitments to reduce or eliminate plastics in packaging, products and ecosystems. And I’m probably not the only one reading them.

While the term ""circular economy"" is still relatively nascent, popular news outlets have been ramping up their coverage of these stories, broadening and maturing the public discourse. Case in point: My mother, a public radio enthusiast, asked me this week if I’d heard about China’s ban on recycling imports. (Thanks, Mom.)

These stories are no longer only for technical journals or activist outlets. Journalists at the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Guardian, NPR and many others have done a fantastic job at covering plastics issues, demonstrating the material economic and environmental impacts of plastics pollution, recycling restrictions and wasteful resource use.

In other words, they’re helping make the case for circularity.

However, with more coverage comes more to track. Here are three stories about plastics that I’m keeping tabs on right now:

1. Commitments are getting real. You may remember that in October, more than 275 brands, retailers, recyclers, governments and NGOs announced a shared vision to close the loop on plastics pollution, the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF). Of course, commitments are one thing; actions are another.

This week, EMF and United Nations Environment released the first progress report on the Global Commitment. A few notable updates: Since October, the number of signatories has grown to more than 350 and includes Apple, Barilla, Tetrapak and L'Occitane en Provence, as well as the government of Rwanda and the cities of Sáo Paulo, Brazil, and Ljubijana, Slovenia.

Major companies including Carrefour, Coca-Cola, Colgate Palmolive, Mars, Nestle, SC Johnson and Unilever publicly have disclosed their annual plastic packaging volumes, marking an important step towards greater transparency in plastics use. Major companies including Carrefour, Coca-Cola, Colgate Palmolive, Mars, Nestle, SC Johnson and Unilever publicly have disclosed their annual plastic packaging volumes, marking an important step towards greater transparency in plastics use. One notable figure: Coca-Cola reports that it consumes 3 million metric tons of plastic packaging annually, although the number has not been independently verified.

Companies outside the Global Commitment are also stepping up their game on plastics: Just this week, U.S. grocery chain Trader Joe’s announced a commitment to cutting 1 million pounds of single-use plastics in its stores (no more plastic-wrapped produce on styrofoam trays).

2. Movement on microfibers: These tiny synthetic fragments, found in waterways, water bottles and humans’ bodies, are raising concerns about the impacts of apparel on the environment. A polyester fleece jacket could shed up to 250,000 of these tiny fibers each time it’s washed, according to a recent study. This adds up to more than 500,000 metric tons of microfibers — the equivalent of 50 billion plastic water bottles — that enter the ocean every year from washing synthetics.

Meanwhile, apparel companies H&M, Patagonia and Adidas are funding research on understanding and solving the world’s microfiber problem, and solutions upstream, in textile processing, and downstream, in at-home washing, are beginning to take off. But the widespread understanding about the consequences of microfibers and solutions to prevent contamination are still early days.

3. Spotlight on chemical recycling: While the market for chemical recycling remains in its infancy — recent predictions suggest the technology could become mainstream within the next decade — the market is heating up. I’m eagerly awaiting the release of a new report by Closed Loop Partners, set for next month, which will examine the landscape of players, language and interventions to accelerate the market.

Innovations continue to bubble up. For example, my colleague Heather Clancy recently wrote about IBM’s breakthrough VolCat system (short for volatile catalyst), which chemically processes mixed plastics even with contaminants such as food residue, dyes and pigments. IBM’s VolCat, Loop Industries and BASF’s ChemCycling project are a few of the growing players in this space.

Chemical recycling will play a significant role in creating more circular value chains for plastics, but faces challenges in scale and economics, as business models are hard-pressed to compete with the cheap price of virgin resin. The next few years will be critical to the development of the technology and business models necessary to make chemical recycling work at scale.

475,Report: $10B in Potential Economic Output from Plastics Recycling Technologies,"A report released by the American Chemistry Council (ACC) finds the potential economic impact of expanding advanced plastic recycling and recovery technologies in the United States to be nearly $10 billion. The report examines a burgeoning class of technologies that convert used plastics into a range of products and raw materials such as chemicals and chemical feedstocks for new plastics, lower carbon transportation fuels and other petroleum-based commodities. By bringing used plastics back into the manufacturing system, these technologies are a key enabler in the drive toward a circular economy for plastics.

According to the report, ""Economic Impact of Advanced Plastics Recycling and Recovery Facilities in the U.S.,"" if widely adopted, these processes could result in nearly 40,000 direct and indirect U.S. jobs, as much as $2.2 billion in annual payroll and another $9.9 billion in direct and indirect economic output.

""Advanced plastic recycling and recovery technologies have the potential to revolutionize the way we make, use and reuse our plastic resources,"" said Steve Russell, ACC's vice president of plastics, in a statement. ""These technologies further demonstrate the untapped value of used plastics and have the potential to dramatically accelerate our transition to a circular economy.""

""Expanding advanced plastic recycling and recovery facilities could create thousands of U.S. jobs, result in billions of dollars in economic output and eliminate the landfilling of 6.5 million tons of post-use recoverable plastics each year,"" said Priyanka Bakaya, founder and CEO of Renewlogy and chair of the Plastics-to-Fuel and Petrochemistry Alliance, which commissioned the study, in a statement.

Several major plastics makers and energy companies have recently announced investments and/or agreements with advanced plastic recycling and recovery technology providers, which are helping to demonstrate and scale these processes.

Last May, plastics makers in the United States, Canada and Europe committed to the goal of recycling or recovering all plastic packaging in these regions by 2040. Such technologies are expected to play a crucial role in meeting these goals.

""Plastic packaging and consumer products weigh less than alternatives, helping to reduce transportation fuel use, greenhouse gas emissions and waste. Learning to treat used plastics as a resource has both economic and environmental benefits. Converting more of these materials to valuable products and raw materials will help keep plastic waste out of the environment and in productive use,"" said Russell.

Prepared by ACC's Economics and Statistics Department, this report updates a similar analysis completed in 2014. The earlier analysis only examined the economic potential associated with converting used plastics into synthetic crude oil. Since then, these technologies have significantly expanded their range of outputs to meet demand for specific commodities.

The latest report examines a class of advanced plastic recycling and recovery technologies commonly known as ""chemical recycling,"" which includes pyrolysis and depolymerization. These advanced technologies complement traditional recycling, also known as ""mechanical recycling,"" and could help society recover and repurpose a much broader range of post-use plastics.",United States,2019.03
476,"Advanced recycling technologies could have $10 billion economic impact, says ACC report","Chemical recycling, or “upcycling,” has been getting a lot of attention lately. We have written about , which has developed a patented and proprietary technology that decouples polymers from fossil fuels by depolymerizing waste plastic into its base building blocks (monomers).

Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) also announced this year an innovative method of plastics upcycling—the —which transforms discarded products into new, high-value materials of better quality and environmental value.

While all of this sounds good, what is the economic value of these new processes? How about nearly $10 billion? If widely adopted, advanced plastics recycling and recovery processes could result in nearly 40,000 direct and indirect U.S. jobs, as much as $2.2 billion in annual payroll, and another $9.9 billion in direct and indirect economic output, according to a report released today by the American Chemistry Council (ACC; Washington, DC), Economic Impact of Advanced Plastics Recycling and Recovery Facilities in the U.S.

479,"UNEP’s Annual Report Highlights Advances in Phasing Out Single-use Plastics, Cutting Cooling and Heating Emissions | News | SDG Knowledge Hub | IISD","7 March 2019: The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) published its 2018 Annual Report, which details UNEP’s work on: climate change; cutting cooling and heating emissions; disasters and conflicts; building resilience and peace in Darfur, Sudan; protecting a peatland in Central Africa; environmental governance; chemicals and waste; resource efficiency; and environment under review.

The report was released in advance of the fourth session of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-4), which convened from 11-15 March 2019 in Nairobi, Kenya.

The report discusses advances in making the cooling and heating industries more climate-friendly, given that cooling and heating systems consume over 50% of building energy and run primarily on fossil fuels. Through the District Energy in Cities Initiative, UNEP supports renewable energy and energy efficiency in the refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump sectors in 16 countries. For example, in Bosnia and Herzegovina’s second-largest city, Banja Luka, the Initiative partnered with the city, the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to provide a district heating network that runs on locally sourced biomass, reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 91% and sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions by 94%.

In the Indian city of Thane, two projects could save 30,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2eq), phase out harmful refrigerants and save customers money. The Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which had 65 ratifications by the end of 2018, is also helping to make the cooling industry more climate-friendly by reducing the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by 80%.

In 2018, UNEP also prioritized reducing plastic pollution in oceans, helping countries commit to phasing out single-use plastics. World Environment Day 2018 targeted plastic pollution, with India, the Day’s host, pledging to phase out single-use plastics by 2022. Other countries and companies made similar commitments, with, for example, the EU proposing a ban on ten single-use plastic items representing 70% of marine litter by 2025. Fifty-seven countries, covering over 60% of the world’s coastlines, signed onto UNEP’s Clean Seas campaign, which addresses marine litter.

In addition, the report highlights that:
• 63 countries have mandates for producer responsibility for single-use plastics, including deposit refunds, product take back and recycling targets;

Among initiatives on financing for sustainable development, 2018 saw 45 banks and financial institutions endorse the Principles for Responsible Banking drafted under the leadership of the UNEP Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), and more than 20 financial centers join the International Network of Financial Centres for Sustainability (FC4S) to help align investments with sustainable development and climate action. In collaboration with BNP Paribas, the World Agroforestry Centre and partners. UNEP also launched a USD 95 million Tropical Landscapes Bond, which will restore 80,000 hectares of tropical forests in Indonesia.

In 2018, UNEP and the World Health Organization (WHO) hosted the first global meeting on air pollution, and continued supporting cleaner transport, including the development of national strategies on electric mobility in several Latin American countries.

UNEP supported South-South cooperation to help save the Cuvette Central Peatlands in the Congo Basin, which stores the carbon equivalent of three years of global emissions. The Brazzaville Declaration, signed by the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the Republic of Congo and Indonesia, will keep this carbon in the ground. UNEP is also supporting efforts to: reduce and better manage waste in the hotel industry in Jordan; and help countries, such as Saint Lucia, report and track their environmental commitments.

In 2019, UNEP will focus on promoting the circular economy, mobilizing science and data, promoting greener cities and supporting renewable energy. [Publication: UNEP Annual Report 2018] [UNEP News Story]",United States,2019.03
480,Greenlight Solutions and Arcosanti residents are working toward a sustainable future,"In Rob Jameson’s makerspace, a sunlit room adorned with journeyman’s tools and various materials meant for creating, Jameson reflected on the lifestyle he has become accustomed to living at Arcosanti. To say the least, he's satisfied.

A small experimental community located in the central Arizona desert, just off the I-17, Arcosanti sits halfway between Phoenix and Flagstaff.

Envisioned in the 1970s by Italian architect Paolo Soleri, every element of Arcosanti is supposed to originate from the concept of arcology, the blending of principles from ecology and architecture. Soleri had a master plan for the town: a completely self-sustained, eco-friendly and collaborative community designed to accommodate about 5,000 residents.

One part of the urban laboratory, ""the slab,"" is a sorted junkyard that is off-limits to most visitors. A look around the slab did not at first imply that there was any rhyme or reason to its layout.

“This is a perfect case study for a failed system,” said Jameson, who has lived at Arcosanti four years and is the chief officer of marketing and technology. Jameson made clear his frustration with the system that was put in place to deal with the excess materials.

To many, the slab would look like a hoarder’s open-air daydream. Items ranging from old couches to tiles to discarded parts of walls were strewn across the dirt inside a small, fenced area.

To the residents of Arcosanti, this collection is a part of their sustainability-focused economy and is a small step into the future of their community.

But that’s only if they can find a way to efficiently recycle and reintegrate the materials.

That’s where Greenlight Solutions at ASU came into play. Greenlight Solutions is a group of students and alumni focused on bringing sustainable practices to businesses and to the general exploration of eco-friendly alternatives through various projects and partnerships.

Greenlight makes semesterly visits to Arcosanti to hold retreats and assist on projects relating to sustainability and engineering. During retreats, the “solutioneers,” as the students are known, have helped organize the cluttered slab into a form of organized chaos, which they now call ""the yard.""

Turning the slab into the yard goes deeper than a name change. Through systematically categorizing the waste, Greenlight and Arcosanti residents are making waste recycling more feasible, all part of Arcosanti’s goal to establish what is called a circular economy.

Circular economy denotes a system of waste management focused on cumulative waste reduction. The concept relies on three principles: reduce waste completely, keep products and materials in use and regenerate natural systems.

This economic system was brought to Jameson’s attention by Greenlight member Connor Damaschi. Damaschi has been a project manager for Greenlight in Arcosanti for the past year and a half.

“A lot of people (in Arcosanti) want to see progress as they see Arcosanti can move forward and push these new sustainable practices,” Damaschi said.

Greenlight and Arcosanti got involved in a story-like way, with Jameson meeting Greenlight founder and ASU alumnus Kevin Kelehar at Ancient Future in 2017, a “cosmic celebration” featuring music and art in Phoenix.

“We were out. He was spinning poi. I was juggling devils sticks, having a grand ole’ time. (We) became best friends,” Kelehar said. “He invited me to host Greenlight for a retreat (in Arcosanti).”

Kelehar said after he visited the first time, he immediately fell in love and decided to move to Arcosanti in February, 2018.

“I see Arcosanti as a great place to continue to hold retreats, to be inspired and make sure our vision is aligned and also bring some of the great ideas of (Arcosanti) to the community,” Kelehar said.

ASU alumnus Ryan Mores is the co-founder and operations director of Greenlight. He said the work the group does in and outside of Arcosanti is not only valuable but necessary in terms of the future of sustainability.

Greenlight has worked with over 40 local businesses in a variety of ways. It often helps create strategic plans for businesses looking to be more sustainable and also get hands-on in certain projects.

“Sustainability is not a fad or a trend, it is something that is going to be here for the long haul,” Mores said. “The new way of business is to be sustainable and look at that triple bottom line. We’re not just worried about profit anymore, we’re worried about the people and the planet.”

The concept of a circular economy is taken into consideration when Greenlight is creating its business strategies. Mores said the principles of a circular economy are only going to get more prevalent in the near future, and spreading insight on them now provides benefits for both businesses and the planet.

""The current system is not sustainable. We can’t continue to just consume, consume, consume and send everything to the landfill. The earth does not have the carrying capacity for that,” Mores said.

Greenlight has assisted heavily in bringing circular economy principles to Arcosanti, and the town has been receptive of the concept. Jameson said there is still a lot of work to do in terms of cleaning up and morphing Arcosanti toward its fully sustainable potential.

“Arcosanti, although it’s a little bit dusty, and maybe it’s a little in need of a pep-start, the ‘why’ of why this place exists is still super relevant,” Jameson said.

Soleri’s brain-child has thus far been unsuccessful, with the number of residents since 1970 ranging from 50 to 150. The proposed utopia may or may not be in Arcosanti’s future, but the vision still exists at the very least in the minds of those who live there. Soleri’s vision permeates the principles of the experimental micro-city, such as shared resources among residents and zero-commuting.

Barrett faculty fellow Michael Ostling takes his students to Arcosanti to study utopian and dystopian societies. The goal of each visit is to examine a real-life attempt at constructing a utopia, to analyze what went wrong and what has actually worked.

“Soleri thought that if he built a city just right, then everything else would follow. People’s behavior would change, their relations would change, economics would change. Like all utopias, it failed,” Ostling said. “On the other hand, it’s pretty cool.”

Despite the failure of Soleri’s vision, Ostling said most utopian attempts at least sow the seeds of new ideas. A standout concept in Arcosanti, Ostling said, is the idea of a shared community.

“Arconauts,” another name for the residents of Arcosanti, have their own small personal living spaces but share a majority of resources, such as studio spaces, a cafe and a pool. Ostling said this shared space model has similarities to mixed-use living arrangements in urban areas, where residents often work, shop and play in the same place.

Although the living situation in Arcosanti is comparable in some ways to the millennial urbanite lifestyle, Jameson said one aspect Arcosanti is missing is what he calls “digital nomads,” or those who solely work online.

Because of communal work commitments, which have every resident doing a variety of practical work for the sake of community upkeep, Jameson said digital nomads would not be able to fit the part of an Arcosanti resident.

Jameson said the living situation in Arcosanti will only gain more relevancy as more young people are moving to cities and urban environments.

“You trade having a large space that is your own domicile for having a small space, but access to shared resources, access to people,” Jameson said. “The kind of centralized eco-conscious design principles that they have pioneered here are only becoming more relevant as that urban way of living becomes the norm.”

In order to live in Arcosanti, potential residents must finish a six-week immersive workshop to learn the ins-and-outs of the community. Through this, those who live in Arcosanti are able to contribute to the growth of the town in some way.

Jameson said the aligned focus on growth among the residents is helpful beyond construction projects. He and his wife recently had a newborn baby, and his neighbors' help makes him thankful for the unique connections created through the setup of Arcosanti.

“To live in a community with 70 friends that are involved in this journey and will cook us meals if we need them and come over and babysit — it’s just amazing,” Jameson said.

While residents are a vital asset to the betterment of Arcosanti, volunteer work and partnerships are also large help for projects that focus on clean up and the advancement of the town. Financial barriers often slow the progress down, but Jameson said the residential and voluntary dedication towards Arcosanti’s growth is what keeps hopes high.

“It’s changing a lot right now,” Jameson said. “I think for the first time in 20 years we are going to have a budget and permission to actually update and innovate the designs and start the process again of ‘What does this eco-conscious city of the future look like?’”

Arcosanti was initially meant to change the world. After 40 years and the constantly accelerating environmental catastrophe brought about through human activity across the globe, it's fair to say Arcosanti did not accomplish what Soleri thought it could. But Arcosanti still exists, and there are still people who take an interest in the place, contributing from near and far to help the town.

For his part, Jameson said that little by little Arcosanti is progressing toward a future where humans live in harmony with their environment.

486,ACC report: Advanced plastics recycling has potential $10B impact,"Installations around the world lead to continued developments in wire and cable processing and recycling.

The government of the People’s Republic of China may consider imported wire and cable scrap as unwanted “foreign garbage,” but recyclers and metals producers around the world continue to process unwanted scrap wire to harvest the valuable copper and aluminum within.

In the second half of this decade, as China’s government stanches the flow of inbound wire and cable scrap, investments in wire processing Europe, North America and other parts of Asia continue unabated.

The steady roster of projects has allowed equipment companies that offer wire processing technology to revamp, upgrade and fine-tune their machinery and systems, in an effort to provide recyclers with rapid return on investment (ROI) and the with systems that will harvest every last gram of metal.

Trept, France-based MTB Recycling both operates a scrap processing facility and designs and makes equipment for the industry.

This decade it has put part of its effort into its “Box” line of processing technologies. In a 2018 conversation with visiting recycling journalist Manfred Beck, MTB Recycling’s owner and CEO Jean-Philippe Fusier told Beck that during some of the slow years in the global economy MTB worked on the Box line.

“These days, people don’t want to wait for months before they get their equipment,” states Fusier. “They want it immediately, want it to be easy to use and installed in next to no time.” He adds that a machine from MTB’s Box line “can be installed in eight hours and it costs 30 percent less than a standard factory installation.”

There are currently several versions of the Boxes, with different units designed to handle cables, tires, plastics, copper, aluminum, e-scrap or auto shredder residue (ASR). MTB’s best seller, according to Fusier, is the Cable Box.

At MTB’s facility in Trept, its large-scale line that processes aluminum cable is housed in a 4,000-square meter (43,000-square foot) building and can process four to five metric tons per hour.

Not all potential customers have such high volume requirements, but with China’s restrictions there is renewed interest in wire chopping in Europe and beyond. MTB has now sold more than 15 Cable Boxes, with several of those sold to the North American market by Wendt Corp.

These units take up 200 square meters (2,150 square feet) yet can still process up to two metric tons per hour, according to Fusier. The Box system contains one shredder, two granulators and a density table.

MTB indicates the acceptance of the Cable Box and other recent innovations is allowing it to expand its manufacturing space in Trept and “triple its production” as part of its MTB 2021 project.

No time like the present

About 1,000 kilometers north of Trept, and across the English Channel, Ipswich, United Kingdom-based S. Sacker Ltd., also known as Sackers Recycling, has opted for a wire processing system made by Denmark based Eldan Recycling A/S.

David Dodds, the company’s managing director, and press releases on the company’s website indicate the firm started off 2019 by ramping up its Eldan system.

Sackers Recycling says the wire processing system “will allow us to process cable at our site rather than selling it on for processing.” Adds the firm, “The machine will run for eight hours per day and will process an incredible 84 kilograms (185 pounds) of cable every minute. Once the copper is processed, it will be sold to customers all over the world, but mostly India and China, [where] it is usually recycled back into more copper cable.”

The U.K. firm describes its new system of consisting of four stages:
• stage one: an Eldan Rasper chops the cable into 10-to-12 millimeter (mm) pieces , and a magnetic belt removes the steel and other magnetic products;
• stage two: a buffer silo spreads the pieces to ensure they are evenly fed into the upcoming granulator;
• stage three: the granulator processes the material into finer pieces of around 4 mm (inches) or less; and
• stage four: a separation table vibrates the processed pieces, using gravity to separate the plastic from the copper.

The company says the Eldan System is part of its larger growth plan and set of action, which has included growing its workforce by 14 percent in 2018, and has resulted in it moving up to No. 53 on a list of “Suffolk’s 100 largest owned and managed businesses” maintained by the East Anglian Times newspaper. Suffolk is the county in England in which Ipswich is the largest city.

United States based metals producer Encore Wire Corp. has taken matters into its own hands when it comes to converting its in-house wire and cable scrap into furnace-ready metal.

The McKinney, Texas-based aluminum and copper wire producer is now using four wire and cable chopping machines supplied by Gold Hill, Oregon-based Sweed Machinery Inc.

Encore Wire has what it describes as “enormous production capacity” to make wire that it distributes in the U.S. But the company’s process engineer Scott Thompson says its scrap processing capabilities lagged behind in sophistication. “We used to have a very labor intensive scrapping process,” Thompson says. “It was a huge labor cost and could potentially pose a hazard to employees.”

At first, the company updated its scrap processing system with a machine from a different equipment manufacturer. “It was a poorly designed and outdated machine,” Thompson says. “The only part of it that worked effectively was a small chopper by Sweed, and it worked really well.”

After considering that, Thompson called Sweed, who he says worked closely with him to understand Encore’s needs, capacity and goals. Four years later, Encore now has three additional Sweed machines customized to its needs, and its scrap processing system has never been more streamlined, according to Thompson.

“Sweed’s machines have exceeded expectations,” he says. Encore uses Sweed’s Model 5703 XHD scrap chopper and PCR 1034 pre-chopper to process linear scrap material. Encore can thus efficiently liberate the copper and aluminum from the products fed into the machines, says Thompson.

Shaker tables further process the PVC, XLPE and nylon plastic coatings by isolating them from the nonferrous copper and aluminum materials to be reclaimed. “We produce and ship millions of pounds of finished product every year,” states Thompson. “A result of manufacturing that much volume is we generate PVC, XLPE and aluminum scrap every year, which diminishes our bottom line.”

Sweed’s machines are enabling Encore to efficiently reclaim reusable raw materials at a lower cost, all while increasing quality and volume of its renewable raw materials internally, according to the company. This increase in material use efficiency and labor savings has resulted in Encore increasing its bottom line.

“It’s a great company,” says Thompson of Sweed Machinery, adding that the firm provides “old school manufacturing that’s down-to-earth and easy to deal with. They’ve got a good way of doing business – just like us.”

487,Report: $10 billion at stake in 'advanced plastics recycling',"An industry report released today highlights economic opportunity in pyrolysis and other emerging plastics processing technologies.

The American Chemistry Council on Wednesday published “Economic Impact of Advanced Plastics Recycling and Recovery Facilities in the U.S.” The report points to $9.9 billion in economic output that could be derived from “a burgeoning class of technologies that convert used plastics into a range of products and raw materials,” including chemical feedstocks, fuels and more.

Such processes are often referred to as chemical recycling, and in recent months a number of investments have been announced to help push the sector forward.

“These technologies further demonstrate the untapped value of used plastics and have the potential to dramatically accelerate our transition to a circular economy,” said Steve Russell, vice president of plastics at ACC, in a release.

Wider adoption of the technologies, which include plastics-to-fuel and other processing methods, would add 40,000 direct and indirect U.S. jobs, the report states, contributing $2.2 billion in annual payroll to the economy.

In the release, Priyanka Bakaya, founder and CEO of plastics-to-fuel company Renewlogy, said wider implementation of plastics recovery technologies could divert 6.5 million tons of end-of-life plastics per year.

488,ACC: Advanced recycling worth $10B impact in US,"Advanced plastics recycling and recovery through depolymerization technologies such as pyrolysis and chemical recycling is gaining steam and represents nearly a $10 billion annual potential, according to one trade group.

But the American Chemistry Council is under no illusion that things are going to change tomorrow or that burgeoning recycling techniques will ever replace existing mechanical recycling efforts that currently dominate.

Steve Russell, vice president of plastics for ACC, points to many high-profile companies that are investing in so-called advanced technology to find solutions that will help society deal with difficult-to-recycle plastics.

“I think we are at a pivotal moment where we are transitioning from proposal and pilot to program delivery and we see that not only in the number of announcements, but also in the profile of the names of companies that are making the announcements,” he said.

A new report from the ACC estimates claims of “advanced plastic recycling and recovery technologies” could be worth almost $10 billion in economic impact in the United States. The report looks at technologies that covert recovered plastics into products such as chemicals and chemical feedstocks.

But the ACC does say adoption of these types of technologies will take time.

“We're under no illusion that everything will turn around tomorrow. There are hurdles to overcome. There are models to refine, technologies to perfect, of course. But I do think we are close enough now that major corporate brands, industry groups like ourselves and others are increasingly comfortable making commitments and projections about what the future of waste management will be for plastics,” he said.

Mechanical recycling now dominates plastics recovery, but work continues on creating economically viable ways to chemically recycle the material. This type of recycling is certainly technically viable, but the struggle has been creating ways to actually make money using that approach.

Plastic recycling lags both paper and metal recycling in the United States due to the unique challenges of handling used resins and keeping them separate. Even small amounts of misplaced resin can cause huge problems in plastics recycling systems.

The report is called “Economic Impact of Advanced Plastics Recycling and Recovery Facilities in the U.S.” The study updates similar work done by the ACC in 2014.

ACC, Russell said, put down an “initial marker” five years ago to begin looking at the potential for the industry. “We thought it was a good idea to both revisit what we have done before and also open the aperture a little bit to include a range of potential outputs that the technology can deliver,” he said. “I think the value of the report is to supplement the big story, which is the investments being made.”

Mechanical and advanced recycling, moving forward, will serve to complement each other as the industry looks to recover more plastics, he said.

Of the $9.9 billion economic impact estimate, the ACC said $4.1 billion could come directly from operations and another $3.5 billion could come from indirect benefits of companies working with recycling firms. Finally, some $2.3 billion could be created through a “payroll-induced effect” or money spent by workers, both direct and indirect.",United States,2019.03
490,Letters: The Growing Recycling Crisis,"I truly believe that legislation must be passed requiring manufacturers to be responsible for recycling the packaging they use for their products.

When and how are we to hold corporations accountable for their role in producing waste? Some big companies have promised to reduce packaging and reduce single-use plastic by 2025. We have to hold them to that. In the meantime, real pricing of products—which includes the cost of dealing with plastic waste—would certainly make consumers think twice about using so many things so mindlessly. All this requires strong civil-society action, and sustained public pressure on big businesses. They do respond to such pressure. Much research is already under way on alternatives. Governments could incentivize and fast-track this research.

Your piece “Is This the End of Recycling?” ignores one obvious solution to the rising costs of recycling: taxing people enough to pay for this essential service. Indeed, the word tax does not appear once anywhere in the piece.

Someone writing about the crisis in recycling should not characterize recycling as simply being too expensive, because this accepts the framing of the issue from the tax-avoidance perspective. Rather, the writer should report from a more neutral standpoint that acknowledges Americans’ refusal to accept taxation on the level that is necessary to pay for important aspects of our civilization.

Americans’ pathological resistance to taxes has real consequences. Yet your piece leaves this self-destructive ideology completely unexamined, despite the central role that it plays in the issue of recycling.

Is this the end of recycling? Let’s hope so. As the article by Ms. Semuels properly points out, recycling does not make economic sense for the companies that collect the recycled materials. It is often half the cost to bury the items that are collected for recycling. With just this data point, we can see that recycling does not add up. If you add the cost of the separate “streams” used to collect the stuff at the neighborhood level, and you add some value for the time misspent by households sorting their trash into three or four different bins, you do the math and see that it might make people feel good, but it is an inefficient use of resources.

Aluminum and glass containers can be recycled back into themselves—a “closed loop”—and aluminum pays for itself to be recycled.

I was a national spokesperson for Alcoa’s can-recycling activity for 12 years. The company spent about $100 million alone in promotional ads over that time and developed machinery, a national recycling network, and technology that was nonexistent when we started. We did this to protect the convenience package of the can, and so many good things happened as a result. If your story is true, I am greatly distressed.",United States,2019.03
491,Zero Waste of Time: when recycling is not enough,"By JULIETTE FRADIN — A few months ago, I, along with my husband and two young kids, embarked on a journey towards zero waste. It all started when I discovered that less than 10 percent of our plastic waste is actually recycled. The rest goes to landfills or is incinerated. I was totally shocked to discover that the efforts I put into buying consciously, sorting and recycling was all for so little. But I decided to dig deeper into the subject and had an epiphany moment when I discovered a zero waste lifestyle.

Zero waste is a movement to reduce the resources you consume and the trash you produce. It is about reducing what you need, reusing as much as you can, sending little to be recycled and composting your food waste. We currently live in a linear economy where products need to be bought again and again because of planned obsolescence, or trashed daily because of single-use design. It is a “take, make, dispose” approach. In contrast, zero waste promotes a circular economy that encourages you to minimize waste and make the most of resources.

The U.S. generates more waste than any other nation in the world, about 30 percent of the planet’s total waste is produced by 4 percent of the world’s population. Half of U.S. garbage consists of nondurable goods (deodorant, shampoo, light bulbs and other consumables), containers and packaging. We live in a disposable society where we don’t always value our belongings as much as we should, and we consume too many resources. In 2010, U.S. landfills had the highest quantity of methane emissions in the world, significantly impacting climate change. Zero waste helps consumers move away from single-use products in favor of long-lasting, reusable ones. Adopting zero waste practices can help us slow down, improve our health, focus on experiences rather than stuff, and even save money.

My goal with this column is to spread the word about zero waste living and inspire you to take action. Through conscientious consuming, you can definitely improve your life while helping the planet. Here are some common misconceptions about the zero waste movement:

ZERO waste is just unattainable!

OK, this one is actually true. Nobody will ever be totally zero waste. Even if you produce the very Instagrammable one Mason jar of trash per year, this doesn’t take into account the manufacturing or agricultural waste that occurs before you even put an item in your cart (or cloth bag). Your goal should be to reduce the amount of trash you create, recognizing that every little effort counts. It is not about being perfect — it’s about making one change at a time, at your own pace, in a way that fits your household’s needs.

Nothing I do makes a difference anyway …

You might think that using a cloth napkin won’t make a dent in climate change, but do not underestimate your actions as an individual. We all have choices, and every person makes a difference. Every time you buy something, you encourage or support a practice or a company, for better or worse. You can choose “for better” by shopping sustainably and locally. The way you live can encourage and inspire others, creating a powerful ripple effect and strengthening your community.

Recycling is NOT the solution, but rather part of the problem. It is hard to recycle properly, it consumes a lot of energy, and a lot of what ends up in recycling plants can’t be processed because it’s contaminated. Contamination occurs when recyclables contain residual food waste, oil or grease, or when items that can’t be recycled (like plastic bags or frozen food boxes) enter the system. (China, which used to process recycling for the U.S., no longer accepts our stuff because of this problem.) There are easy ways you can reduce your waste and plastic consumption so that you don’t even have to worry about recycling: compost, bring your own water bottle, use your own produce bags, clean with vinegar, and so on. The solution to the waste and plastic problem is not to recycle more but to consume less.

Kids and a zero waste lifestyle are not compatible.

It is true that kids often mean lots of clutter and unwanted stuff, but you can still lead by example. Educate yourself and your family, and take easy, small first steps like switching to bamboo toothbrushes. Let your kids help at the bulk food aisle, tag along at the farmers market and bake snacks with you, and teach them to say no to freebies. Kids are often genuinely happy and feel empowered when they have the knowledge and tools to help protect the planet. Also, Hyattsville has an active parents’ community on- and offline; you can request to join the Hyattsville Nurturing Parents email group at hnparents-subscribe@yahoogroups.com. And the upcoming HY-Swap on April 6 will be a great place to score secondhand clothes and toys for kids.

So welcome to “Zero Waste of Time.” I hope it can provide inspiration and empower you to start your own zero waste journey. Let’s get better together.",United States,2019.03
492,Report Finds $10 Billion In Potential Economic Output From Advanced Technologies That Recycle And Recover Plastics,"According to the report, "" Economic Impact of Advanced Plastics Recycling and Recovery Facilities in the U.S. ,"" if widely adopted, these processes could result in nearly forty thousand direct and indirect U.S. jobs, as much as $2.2 billion in annual payroll, and another $9.9 billion in direct and indirect economic output.

""Advanced plastic recycling and recovery technologies have the potential to revolutionize the way we make, use, and reuse our plastic resources,"" said Steve Russell, ACC's vice president of plastics. ""These technologies further demonstrate the untapped value of used plastics and have the potential to dramatically accelerate our transition to a circular economy.""

""Expanding advanced plastic recycling and recovery facilities could create thousands of U.S. jobs, result in billions of dollars in economic output, and eliminate the landfilling of 6.5 million tons of post-use recoverable plastics each year,"" said Priyanka Bakaya, founder and CEO of Renewlogy and chair of the Plastics-to-Fuel and Petrochemistry Alliance, which commissioned the study.

Several major plastics makers and energy companies have recently announced investments and/or agreements with advanced plastic recycling and recovery technology providers, which are helping to demonstrate and scale these processes.

Last May plastics makers in the United States, Canada and Europe committed to the goal of recycling or recovering all plastic packaging in these regions by 2040. Such technologies are expected to play a crucial role in meeting these goals.

""Plastic packaging and consumer products weigh less than alternatives, helping to reduce transportation fuel use, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste. Learning to treat used plastics as a resource has both economic and environmental benefits. Converting more of these materials to valuable products and raw materials will help keep plastic waste out of the environment and in productive use,"" Russell said.

Prepared by ACC's Economics and Statistics Department, this report updates a similar analysis completed in 2014. The earlier analysis only examined the economic potential associated with converting used plastics into synthetic crude oil. Since then, these technologies have significantly expanded their range of outputs to meet demand for specific commodities.

The latest report examines a class of advanced plastic recycling and recovery technologies commonly known as ""chemical recycling,"" which includes pyrolysis and depolymerization. These advanced technologies complement traditional recycling, also known as ""mechanical recycling,"" and could help society recover and repurpose a much broader range of post-use plastics.

494,Chems recycling maturity timeline shortening as momentum builds – INEOS director,"LONDON (ICIS)--The popular perception of a 10-year window before chemicals recycling matures may be pessimistic due to the level of industrial and governmental interest, with the technology representing the ultimate solution to the viability of the circular economy, according to INEOS director Tom Crotty.

The process of breaking plastic waste down to its constituent molecular parts to reconstitute it as a petrochemicals feedstock, is the key measure to drive the development of a circular economy, and may be commercially viable earlier than expected, according to Crotty.

“We're a lot closer than people think,” he said, speaking on the sidelines of the IdentiPlast conference. “People are talking about a 10-year horizon, but I think there is a following wind behind it now.”

“It is the ultimate solution to this, and I think we're closer than people think because suddenly there is an incentive to get that right,” he added.

The sentiment was echoed by other chemicals industry executives, with representatives of BASF and INEOS Styrolution also setting out timelines of five to 10 years for the industry to reach maturity.

Increasing levels of plastic ocean waste, and growing consumer awareness of the health and environmental impacts of single-use plastics, is driving a raft of new legislation proposals, and the petrochemicals industry is rushing to drive the direction of those new policies.

The emphasis from the sector is of increasing the circularity of the value chain, rather than banning single-use plastics outright, as has been mooted for some forms, or implementing measures that could drive the take-up of less controversial forms of packaging that have a greater environmental impact.

Speaking in November 2018, European Presidential hopeful Frans Timmermans said that, whereas in the past, industry and government were at cross purposes, CEOs and policymakers are increasingly speaking the same language.

Nevertheless, proposed measures by some governments are blunt instruments, according to Crotty, who criticised the UK government’s proposal to mandate a 30% tax on the content of all plastics packaging be derived from recycled materials by 2022.

“I criticised the UK's position on tax is because it's a crude measure,” he said. There are some applications where you should have 100% recycled content and some where you should have zero, so how do you follow that? The other issue with it is whether measures will be the same for glass, steel, aluminium. It’s being selective, and that is an error in my opinion.”

Regulations that give value to plastic waste and encourage more positive industry and consumer behaviour, such as deposit return schemes, will have a positive influence on sourcing and use of waste plastics, he added, noting the success of small plastic bag charges.

The necessity of giving value to waste plastics has also been advanced by Jim Fitterling of Dow Chemical, speaking at the 2019 Davos, Switzerland, summit as an emissary of industry-led initiative the Alliance for Ending Plastic Waste (AEPW).

Many of the leading names in polymers have signed up to the initiative, including BASF and LyondellBasell, as well as consumer and engineering groups like Procter & Gamble and Veolia.

Despite being one of Europe’s key producers of olefins and polymers, INEOS –which is a member of Operation Clean Sweep, another initiative – has held back from signing up to the deal.

“We tend to be a company that is a bit different, we like to do things on our own, we like to be in control of our own destiny, and that's why we decided to do our own thing,” Crotty said.

One role for the government in facilitating the shift to a circular plastics system, is in improving collection and sorting systems to provide the raw material for crackers.

“I think what will become rapidly the limiting factor is the availability of recycled material,” he said. “Once we find the technical solution it is almost easy because it's under our control, you can do that in a lab, you can scale it up.

“But then, say we convert our cracker line at Grangemouth to take waste plastic feedstock. That's going to be a [huge] investment, and we’re going to need a million tonnes of waste material. Where's the million tonnes? That's where the government has to step up to the plate,” he added, noting that the UK has hundreds of disparate waste collection systems.

The shift will be epochal reinvention for the petrochemicals industry, he added.

“We need to go right back to the cracker here, we are not just talking about tweaking at the edges of the process, talking about new cracker feedstocks, and that's going to be hundreds of millions in investments, not tens of millions,” Crotty said.",United States,2019.03

496,Chems recycling maturity timeline shortening as momentum builds – INEOS director,"LONDON (ICIS)--The popular perception of a 10-year window before chemicals recycling matures may be pessimistic due to the level of industrial and governmental interest, with the technology representing the ultimate solution to the viability of the circular economy, according to INEOS director Tom Crotty.

The process of breaking plastic waste down to its constituent molecular parts to reconstitute it as a petrochemicals feedstock, is the key measure to drive the development of a circular economy, and may be commercially viable earlier than expected, according to Crotty.

“We're a lot closer than people think,” he said, speaking on the sidelines of the IdentiPlast conference. “People are talking about a 10-year horizon, but I think there is a following wind behind it now.”

“It is the ultimate solution to this, and I think we're closer than people think because suddenly there is an incentive to get that right,” he added.

The sentiment was echoed by other chemicals industry executives, with representatives of BASF and INEOS Styrolution also setting out timelines of five to 10 years for the industry to reach maturity.

Increasing levels of plastic ocean waste, and growing consumer awareness of the health and environmental impacts of single-use plastics, is driving a raft of new legislation proposals, and the petrochemicals industry is rushing to drive the direction of those new policies.

The emphasis from the sector is of increasing the circularity of the value chain, rather than banning single-use plastics outright, as has been mooted for some forms, or implementing measures that could drive the take-up of less controversial forms of packaging that have a greater environmental impact.

Speaking in November 2018, European Presidential hopeful Frans Timmermans said that, whereas in the past, industry and government were at cross purposes, CEOs and policymakers are increasingly speaking the same language.

Nevertheless, proposed measures by some governments are blunt instruments, according to Crotty, who criticised the UK government’s proposal to mandate a 30% tax on the content of all plastics packaging be derived from recycled materials by 2022.

“I criticised the UK's position on tax is because it's a crude measure,” he said.

497,Greiner boss highlights role of packaging in sustainability,"Reviewing the environmental developments over the past 14 months, Stanek said the European Union Strategy for Plastics, introduced in January 2018, was a positive development.

“We were all discussing bio-based, biodegradable and reusing resources in 2016 and 2017, but the strategy gave us a clear direction: the journey we are going to take is going to be towards recycling,” Stanek said.

The fast-paced development of the strategy, according to the Greiner boss, is likely to continue later this month, with the European Parliament expected to approve the Single-Use Plastics (SUP) directive at the end of the month.

“A lot of activities have taken place in the last 12 months. This is going to continue now as we have the European Union elections in May,” said Stanek.

Once approved by the EP plenary session, set for March 25-28, the EU environment ministers are then expected to endorse the directive during their meeting in Romania in May.

But according to Stanek, the political and legislative activities around sustainability of plastics has not stopped the industry from expanding.

“Last year we had record production, globally and in the European Union.

In Germany, plastics production grew to an all-time record of 14.8 million tonnes last year, a year-on-year increase of 2.6 percent, which is double the global GDP growth.

The dilemma for the industry is to deal with the criticism while meeting the higher demand.

The record production numbers, according to Stanek, are not likely to change, considering the global megatrends.

With the global population increasing at a rate of 7 million people per month, and an estimated 4.9 billion middle class population by 2030, packaging consumption is expected to increase, rather than decrease in the future.

Urbanization, personalization and e-commerce are other megatrends, which are to contribute to the growth of packaging industry in the future, according to Stanek.

All these, he noted, impose a special responsibility, particularly on the plastic packaging industry which he said was “in the middle of the turmoi,l” to deal with the challenges of environment and society.

“I think this is a very big challenge, but also something with which we can make an impact. We think that we can make this impact only if the entire value chain works together,” Stanek said.

“We need to step up to the plate and come up with a solution on how to make this transition [to a circular model],” said Stanek.

Based in Oberwaltersdorf, 30 minutes outside Vienna, Greiner is a family-owned packaging business with annual sales of 1.6 billion euros ($1.82 billion) per year.

498,How will Brexit affect the U.K.’s transition to a circular economy?,"The objective of the circular economy is to move away from a linear throw-away system toward one in which depleting resources are reused to maximize their potential and minimize waste.

Recycling plays a key role, reflected in one of the EU’s pan-European objectives to reach 50% of reused or recycled residential waste by 2020. It is difficult to overestimate the role the European Union has played in the protection of the circular economy in the U.K.; around 80% of the U.K.’s environmental laws have been created by the European government.

But with the March 29 deadline now less than two weeks away, and Theresa May still unable to successfully pass a deal through parliament, there are doubts about the future of the circular economy in the U.K. The EU’s latest Circular Economy Package will not come into full force until after the currently scheduled exit day and, dependent on the type of Brexit deal achieved, the U.K. may or may not be obliged to keep to these targets.

Brief history of the U.K. circular economy

Before the start of the 21st century, recycling was relatively peripheral to U.K. society. This shift, in policy and culture, was prompted by EU regulations that resulted in a national strategy to deal with waste in 2000 and the subsequent introduction of statutory recycling targets.

In 2011 the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs outlined 13 actions the country needed to take to move toward a zero-waste economy. These commitments also largely stemmed from EU laws.

But progress in recent years has halted. The rate of household waste recycling fell to 43.7% between 2016 and 2017; the U.K. may now fail the EU’s 50% objective for 2020. This indicates the need for legally binding legislation. In 2018, the EU drew up ambitious goals, like all plastic packaging being recyclable by 2030. Its Revised Legislative Framework on Waste demands 70% of packaging waste to be recyclable by 2030, as well as 65% of urban waste by 2035.

Environment Secretary Michael Gove has vowed to implement these targets even after Brexit, but the U.K.’s interactions with recent EU environmental regulations calls this commitment into question. Take, for example, the U.K.’s initial opposition to the EU’s 2035 urban waste strategy, as well as previous resistance to the ban on bee-harming neonicotinoids. Without the pressure of the EU and its multimillion-euro fines, after Brexit the U.K. could easily fall short of rigorous environmental standards.",United States,2019.03
499,Measuring The Circular Economy's Performance,"Science allows us to understand the mechanisms of the environment we live in as well as how we, as human beings, have an impact on it. As such, human influence and negative impact on climate change, natural habitat destruction, or resource depletion is widely acknowledged. Particularly, the business-as-usual and so-called “take-make-waste” linear industrial production systems are no longer sustainable.

Shifting toward more circular industrial eco-systems appears, then, as a suitable endeavor to meet the goals of sustainable development. A circular economy is indeed looking for better management of resources throughout the lifecycle of systems, and it is characterized by closed loops, promoting maintenance, sharing, leasing, reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling. It aims to retain the highest utility and value of products, materials, and resources at all times to minimize the generation of waste.

Yet, a circular economy is still an umbrella concept that can mean different things to different people: there is no standardized definition of a circular economy, and more than 100 definitions have been reviewed by researchers in 2018. In the meantime, new methods and tools, including indicators, are needed to support industrial practitioners in their transition towards more circular practices. Businesses are notably looking for new set of key performance indicators to measure and monitor their progress within a circular economy. As a result, numerous circularity indicators have been developed in the last few years (n.b. more than 50 sets have been inventoried), but in an inconsistent and fuzzy manner regarding their scopes, purposes, and possible applications.

To help decision-makers – such as industrial managers, engineers, or designers (e.g., during product design and development phases) – identify the most appropriate set of circularity indicators in regard to their needs, taxonomy can be incredibly useful. Historically used to classify living organisms, taxonomy, which translates from Ancient Greek as “arrangement method” is a tool for categorizing elements in groups (or taxa) based on common features. From a research point of view, the organization of knowledge, here through taxonomy, is fundamental to understand and build on the current database of circularity indicators, so that one can select the indicator(s) appropriate to his or her need, but also to identify patterns, relationships, and make inferences between these indicators. From a more operational point of view, and to facilitate the identification of suitable circularity indicators, a selection tool “The C-Indicators Advisor,” linked to the database of more than 50 sets of circular economy indicators, has been developed.

In this first taxonomy of indicators for a circular economy, published in 2019, which includes 10 categories, circularity indicators are differentiated regarding criteria such as the levels of circular economy implementation (micro, meso, macro), the circular economy loops (maintain, reuse, remanufacture, recycle), the performance (intrinsic, impacts), and the perspective of circularity (actual, potential) they are taking into account, or their degree of transversality (generic, sector-specific).

All in all, this taxonomy provides a synthesis and clarification to the emerging and much-needed research theme of circular economy indicators. Eventually, this synthesis and organization of indicators can also notably be useful to identify remaining gaps among the clusters of circularity indicators. For instance, at a micro level of circular economy implementation (n.b. level of materials, products, companies), circularity indicators – such as the Material Circularity Indicators, the Circular Economy Indicator Prototype, or the Circularity Potential Indicator – can be used as a time-efficient tool (i.e., in comparison of performing a lifecycle analysis) to provide a first trend (e.g., an estimation during product design and development phases) of the intrinsic product circularity performance over life cycle, and to compare design alternatives.

Yet, the correlation between the circularity and sustainability performance of products is not directly taken into account through these indicators, which is an important point to consider in the future design of circular economy indicators, to ensure the development and monitoring of truly circular and sustainable eco-products, systems and services.",United States,2019.03
500,"Engel targets sustainability, joins New Plastics Economy","Engel Group has signed the New Plastics Economy global commitment of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, becoming one of the first machinery companies to make the circular economy pledge.

The Schwertberg, Austria-based company said it joined the closed-loop plastics initiative, which includes more than 350 players in the value chain, in mid-March.

“As a member of the international plastics industry, we are not only responsible for our own products, but also for the products that are produced by our machines,"" CEO Stefan Engleder said.

The company, he said, aims to use its experience to ensure that plastics are handled responsibly worldwide and that “the conditions are created for plastic products to be returned to the material cycle at the end of their useful life.”

As part of this, Engel said it is supporting its customers in designing and producing packaging in compliance with the circular economy rules.

The company also helps customers open up a wider range of applications for recycled materials.

Engel said it will center its focus on providing a high level of process consistency and on preventing rejects with the help of intelligent assistant systems. The company will also develop innovative processing technologies aimed at further increasing the proportion of recycled material in sandwich components.

Increased focus will also be placed on working closely with processors in the course of product development with the goal of reducing material usage and enabling the subsequent recycling of products.

The company said it aims to further strengthen its consulting services in the area of upstream processes in a bid to optimize the processing of recycled materials for injection molding.

The Ellen MacArthur Foundation is one of the leading global drivers of the circular economy. Since 2010, the organization founded by British sailor Ellen MacArthur has been committed to a sustainable, resource-saving economy.

In concrete terms, the initiative founded in 2018 is about avoiding unnecessary packaging and ensuring that by 2025, all plastic packaging will be reused, recycled or composted.

Each member company is asked to set individual goals and report regularly on its progress to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.",United States,2019.03
501,"Circular Economy: Waste not, want not","Finland has transformed the way it looks at waste. As the first country to publish a circular economy road map in 2016, it no longer sees waste as something with no value that needs to be disposed of.

Instead, resources should be kept in use as long as possible and recovered to generate new products. This has led the country to invest in waste-to-energy plants, implement policies that require waste separation and provide financial support to those who invent solutions.

However, the effort to transform waste management has not been cheap. For instance, waste-to-energy is an initiative that requires heavy investments and policies that can incentivise the public to choose this option. It also requires a high level of awareness and political will. Add to that the fact that waste is neither the most economical nor the most efficient way to produce energy.

“Waste-to-energy generation plants are quite expensive for consumers. In Finland, we are planning to put some taxes on waste to make it more expensive so that recycling becomes a more affordable option for the people,” says Vantaa Energy production director Kalle Patomeri.

He was speaking to Enterprise during a recent media tour on the Circular Economy and Clean Tech in Finland.

In 2014, Vantaa Energy — one of the largest city energy companies in the country — built a waste-to-energy plant that uses mixed waste to provide heat for the roughly 1.5 million people living in Vantaa and Helsinki. The company is owned by the two cities.

The waste comes from the nearby Ämmässuo Waste Treatment Centre, which is operated by the Helsinki Region Environmental Services Authority HSY. Mixed waste excludes biodegradable waste (biowaste), hazardous waste, electronic or electrical devices and paper.

“We are burning almost 400,000 tonnes of waste per year and producing half the heat energy in Vantaa. We have several hundred kilometres of underground piping, with 80% of the houses in the city heated by this system,” says Patomeri, adding that it cost around €300 million to build the facility, which is also equipped with a gas turbine.

The waste-to-energy plant has reduced 374,000 tonnes of waste that would have ended up in the landfill, according to the website of the city of Vantaa. The plant also reduced Vantaa Energy’s use of fossil fuels by 40% and carbon emissions by 30%. In the future, the company plans to retrofit another of its power plants for the use of domestic biofuels.

Even then, turning waste into energy is not a long-term plan. The goal is to reduce the amount of waste produced in the first place. As Patomeri says, the cost of waste management may increase for consumers and companies in the future, thus incentivising them to either reduce the amount of waste created or invent products that can be reused or recycled.

“I don’t think it will happen immediately. It takes time. For instance, my son is only 11 years old, but he is already very educated on what to do with waste. He is always complaining, ‘Please, don’t put that waste in that bin!’” says Patomeri.

“He is also educated on how not to produce waste. He celebrated his birthday recently, but he did not want any material goods as a present. He just wanted services or money for gaming. He does not seem to want to own things as much. The young people in Finland seem to be like that.”

According to Statistics Finland, only 1% of municipal waste in 2017 was disposed at landfills, a continuation of a decade-long downward trend. Most of the waste goes into energy production or is used for material recovery.

Vantaa is studying methods to clean ash, a by-product of the process. Ash is currently transported to HSY to be composted or put in landfills.

Despite these initiatives, the country still does not have enough capacity to deal with all of its waste. It still exports some industrial and commercial waste to neighbouring Estonia and Sweden. According to Patomeri, a plant that is currently under construction in Finland will cut these exports by half.

“After that, maybe just another smaller plant will be built. And still, we have to export some waste from Finland. My guess is that in five years, we can burn our own waste. But [this may change as] the amount of waste will go down with more recycling,” he says.

Meanwhile, HSY is the other entity that serves Helsinki residents. It is in charge of waste sorting, recycling and water management. The municipal body also manages the Sortti stations, where people can drop off items that are too big for their domestic waste bins. This could be garden waste, wood and electrical or electronic equipment.

“We like to call the Ämmässuo Waste Treatment Centre the eco-industrial centre because we do not want to say we are handling waste. In the circular economy, it is not waste,” says Tiila Korhonen, acting operations manager for waste handling at HSY. Ämmässuo is the largest waste treatment centre in the Nordic region, she adds.

Waste that has been collected is processed for various uses. For instance, mixed waste is sent to Vantaa Energy while biowaste is composted and turned into fertiliser. Useful materials are extracted from construction waste to be reused.

For the whole process to be efficient, separation of waste at the source is important. According to Finnish regulations, if there are more than five households in a building, the tenants have to separate plastic waste, metals, glass, biowaste, paper and mixed waste into separate bins.

“The households do not get penalised for not doing source separation, but we charge them for the cost of the bins [and collection]. We have decided to make the biowaste bin much cheaper, although the handling of biowaste is actually more expensive than mixed waste. So, if you separate your biowaste, you can get a cheaper rate,” says Korhonen.

With separation at the source, the biowaste is cleaner and can form better compost material, for which there is demand from the huge agricultural industry. “I know some countries that do not separate waste at the source and that kind of compost is problematic due to contamination with heavy metals and glass,” says Korhonen.

Plastic bags are part of the problem. Much of the biowaste collected from grocery stores still have the packaging attached while household biowaste is often wrapped in plastic. Although there are plastic bags made from starch, the biodegrading process takes three months, which means it will remain in the plant for some time.

“Our process here takes three weeks. So, the plastic bags do not have time to break down. But it is still better than normal plastic. They are elastic, thinner and easier to break open than normal plastic bags,” says Korhonen.

Compared with the usual methods of dealing with waste, these processes are more expensive. According to Roni Järvensivu, another spokesman for HSY, recycling construction waste is the most economical for the company because the metal, wood and mineral fractions extracted can be reused easily.

“I would say composting is the least economically viable alternative. It gives us the least amount of returns as it is much more expensive to treat compared with other kinds of waste. It requires many steps and takes a long time to complete. But we also have to consider the fact that fertiliser is very important for the community here,” he says.

HSY does not get any funding from the government or municipalities. The waste and water management is paid for by the residents themselves. The company does not process commercial waste as it is handled by other entities. That means HSY needs to make sure it can get enough funding to treat all of the biowaste from households in the area.

“We could use less money on investments or research. We would be able to fund waste management that way. But we will not be doing any good for society if we do not do research and invest in better facilities,” says Järvensivu.

Malaysia relies largely on landfills for waste disposal. Waste separation has been mandatory in several states (Johor, Melaka, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Kedah and Perlis, as well as the federal territories) since September 2015.

There are incinerators in locations such as Cameron Highlands, Langkawi and Pulau Tioman, although reports say some are under repair. Incinerators can turn trash into energy, gas, ash and other products. If treated properly, the gas can be released while the energy can be used to generate electricity — but only if the incinerator is equipped with such technology.

Of the roughly 38,000 tonnes of waste generated daily in Malaysia, only 24% are separated to be recycled while the rest is sent to landfills, according to Deputy Housing and Local Government Minister Datuk Raja Kamarul Bahrin Shah Raja Ahmad last October. The Klang Valley is the biggest waste generator, the majority of which being food waste.

The government has plans to move away from landfills to more sustainable solutions. The ministry’s goal is to increase the waste separation and recycling rate to 30% by 2020. Housing and Local Government Minister Zuraida Kamaruddin was quoted as saying in reports last July that her intention is to replace landfills with more energy efficient and eco-friendly waste management methods. This includes biomass waste management technology, waste-to-energy, incinerators and biodigesters.

However, the issue of waste management is one that deeply affects local communities and evokes mixed opinions. Some argue that incinerators will cause air pollution or that the incinerator technology sourced from overseas may not work in Malaysia. Meanwhile, others find it to be a better solution than landfills.

When a waste-to-energy plant was proposed to be incorporated into the Kuala Lumpur Transfer Station in Taman Beringin in 2014, it was met with objections from a group of residents, who found it too close to residential areas and were worried about the possibility of air pollution.

On the other hand, Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change Minister Yeo Bee Yin has been quoted as saying that the low levels of waste separation in Malaysia have caused an increase in the solid waste produced. Many news reports have highlighted how this could be due to low awareness among the public as well as the lack of cooperation from garbage collectors.

The federal government’s plan for the waste-to-energy plant is still going ahead.

Last December, the Selangor government announced its intention to partner China Western Power Industrial Co to develop a waste-to-energy system in the state. The first phase involves the launch of a waste-to-energy plant in Jeram.

The plant, which is expected to be completed by 2022, will burn waste to generate electricity. It will be the biggest incinerator in Malaysia.

The state government plans to spend RM1 billion on two phases of the project. Another two waste-to-energy plants are expected to be built in Selangor to process the waste produced in the state, according to Worldwide Group chief operating officer Zamri Abdul Rahman in a news report last December. Worldwide Group is wholly-owned by the Selangor government.",United States,2019.03

HP’s commitment to sustainability guides how we do business and drives the way our printers are designed, made and used,” explains Enrique Lores, President of HP Inc.'s Imaging & Printing business. “Today at HP Reinvent, we took one step further by pledging to lead the industry in making every page you print sustainable.”

As HP looks to grow without increasing its consumption of raw materials and thrive in a resource-constrained future, the company is well-positioned to help customers do the same. Supporting a vision to build sustainable products, the company engineers Original HP supplies to help reduce risk for its customers, their reputation, and the planet.

Forest Positive Future

With today’s pledge, the company aims to make every page printed on an HP printer forest positive by extending beyond its consumer printers, which are forest positive, to its entire portfolio to include commercial printers. In 2016, HP achieved 100% zero deforestation associated with HP-branded paper, nearly two years ahead of schedule– marking a milestone towards the company’s vision for a forest positive future. Plus, the company’s paper-based product packaging zero deforestation goal is on track for 2020. In addition, 100% of HP branded paper sold in North America is certified by the Forest Stewardship Council®, ensuring transparency and responsible forest management.

Carbon Neutral 

HP is taking an ambitious step today towards our vision of carbon neutral printing with the introduction of the new energy efficient EcoSmart LaserJet printer and EcoSmart black toner, which has a lower melt temperature, thereby reducing the energy consumption of HP printers.

But even more valuable than individual products, is how HP’s products work together through HP’s Managed Print Services (MPS) offerings – helping customers achieve ambitious sustainability goals and better their bottom line. By partnering with HP, customers have reported a 33% annual reduction in carbon emissions, energy consumption and costs2.

Circular Economy

HP continues to support a circular economy with its consumer and business products, recently reinventing its printer suite to include closed-loop recycled plastics, with HP ENVY and Tango printers comprised of 30% closed-loop recycled plastics3. Since 2000, over 199 million pounds of recycled content plastic have been used in 3.9B HP Original ink and toner cartridges1. Two years ago, HP introduced the first HP Original ink cartridges made with plastic bottles sourced from Haiti. As of today, the company has sourced more than 550,000 pounds of ocean-bound plastic for use in our products – the equivalent of more than 12 million plastic bottles that might otherwise have washed into the ocean and waterways. Our R&D teams invest up to five years engineering each new generation of toner and ink cartridges to deliver quality printing and 100% of toner cartridges and 80% of ink cartridges contain recycled content1.

Market Expectations

People expect brands to stand for more than the products they sell. A 2019 Edelman study on trust disclosed a staggering 67% of consumers self-identify as Belief-Driven Buyers and believe brands can be a force for social good5. In the workplace, initial findings of a global supplies study conducted by HP reveals a company’s commitment to sustainability impacts employee recruitment, retention and advocacy with over 50% of today’s US workforce expecting sustainable practices by employers 4.

HP Original Supplies are engineered to provide the highest quality printing experience. For HP, this means prioritizing the safety of your printer and the planet by producing reliable ink and toner cartridges, while raising the awareness of the harmful impacts clone and imitation cartridges can have on the environment, print quality, and customer costs.

Transform to Perform

HP has a bold vision for what the future of printing can look like, and it starts with challenging the printing industry to transform and continuously innovate. The company’s pledge for print sustainability announced today aims to protect forests, reduce carbon emissions, and use more recycled materials. Circular economy models help decouple economic growth and natural resource consumption while driving greater competitiveness. Transforming print sustainability is not only good for the planet – it’s good for business.

505,"At least 700 mn Indians will get into cities by 2050, need to reduce waste now: NITI Aayog CEO","Municipal authorities are failing at their basic jobs, which is managing waste, said NITI Aayog chief executive officer Amitabh Kant at a conference on waste management in New Delhi. Speaking at a conference titled ‘Waste Reduction, Circular Economy and Enhanced Livelihoods’ organised by non-profit entities Chintan and Friedrich Ebert Stiftung and the University of Chicago, India, Kant criticised the municipal authorities for the dismal situation of waste management in India. “Municipalities are not doing their jobs, and if they fail at doing their basic job of managing waste, they need to be voted out.”

Without mincing his words, the planning body chief said their primary job is to keep the areas under their jurisdiction clean but instead they are getting into the business of construction. “Their one point plan has to be waste. But they are getting into building constructions and mayors have allowed them to go haywire.” He suggested that the “best officers of states need to be posted as municipal commissioners and they should be given tenure to perform”.

Making a larger point about the future of waste management in the country vis-a-vis rapid urbanisation, Kant emphasised that as of now India generates at least 71 million tonnes of waste every day and by 2050, nearly 700 million people will be getting into the process of urbanisation. “The urbanisation process has ended in Europe, US and China. In India, it has just begun. If we are generating 71 million tonnes of waste every day, it will only increase unless we reduce waste and ensure segregation at source at household-level. Municipal authorities need to be held accountable,” he said.

This is where the need for a circular economy comes into the equation. Founder of Chintan Bharati Chaturvedi said that people don’t yet understand what a circular economy means. “‘Oh yeah I recycle’, people say when they are asked. But that’s not the point of a circular economy,” she iterated. “You just have to reduce waste first. There’s only so much that technology can do. And to implement a circular economy, you don’t have to disrupt your lives completely,” she added.

Professor at the University of Rhode Island Manbir Sodhi, who was one of the experts at the conference, asked, “Can’t we continue to not close the loop? And how do we do it in a way that doesn’t have negative effects?” He said the traditional circular economy concept of ‘take, make and break’ prevalent for the last 150 years is old now. “Because in a circular economy, you look at repairing materials, you look at serviceability, then take the materials used, break them down, and reuse them again, and lastly recover materials from the forward stream and use the materials in the reverse loop to attain similar levels of efficiency,” said Sodhi. “There is no reason why the ‘repair economy’ can’t be stronger.”

Circular Economy will potentially create 600,000 jobs by 2025 in EU

Highlighting the importance of a circular economy in job creation and reduction in greenhouse gases in the European Union, Henriette Faergemann, who is the Environment, Climate and Energy Counsellor for the European Union delegation to India, said jobs and growth are important agendas in this ecosystem. “If this is properly implemented, then we can create at least 600,000 jobs by 2025. Each household could save 500 Euros per year, estimated waste prevention could get 400 billion Euros and there could be at least 2.4 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions,” she said. “If we use this ecosystem, then we can potentially save energy consumption equivalent to all of Italy,” Henriette emphasised.

In the Indian context, implementation of a circular economy in the current scenario, however, isn’t going to be easy given that some of the biggest challenges are of consumption, urbanisation, and pollution. But the government is positive about the future of a circular economy, and India is already moving in that direction, claimed AK Jain, Additional Secretary for the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MOEFCC).

“The culture of a circular economy has been in India from before. We need to formalise the subject here. We have a reduce, reuse, and recycle culture but we don’t acknowledge the problem of resource exploitation. We feel that time has come when we can have a ‘Bureau of Resource Efficiency’ but we need consensus. A material recycling policy is also in the offing,” said Jain.

One of the hurdles towards achieving a circular economy and attain waste reduction is a lack of policy implementation. And Malati Gadgil, former CEO, SWaCH, Pune, believes that while policy changes need to happen, their implementation and monitoring is important. “Policy changes also need to be incremental and we need to adopt a systems approach and ditch the silo approach to waste management, she said.

Padding up Gadgil’s point of view, Dr. Kuldeep Sangwan, professor at the Mechanical Engineering Department of BITS Pilani, said his team conducted a study among German and Indian manufacturers in 2008 and 2011 respectively to study the challenges in waste management and circular economy. “The study’s findings were common in India and Germany except one: poor implementation of laws,” he said. “In a circular economy, the focus is on reuse. Recycling isn’t a part of this, it’s more for social effects. Recycling has to be the last loop,” added Sangwan.

Amitabh Kant warns that unless we reduce our waste, we might be in much bigger trouble than right now. “This is not just about waste,” said Kant. “It’s about the survival of our race. If we keep creating waste what will happen when another 700 million Indians will get into cities by 2050?”

506,PepsiCo Latin America’s ‘Recycling with Purpose’ Incentivizes Circular Consumer Practices,"On Monday, in honor of Global Recycling Day, PepsiCo launched “Recycling with Purpose,” a circular economy model that promotes recycling across Latin America and the Caribbean. This initiative will support PepsiCo’s commitment to build a world where plastics need never become waste through a vision rooted in three pillars: reducing, recycling and reinventing.

More than half of the plastics ever produced have been made in the past 16 years, and of those produced each year, only five percent are effectively recycled for future use, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. PepsiCo says “Recycling with Purpose” encourages consumer involvement and education, promotes inclusive recycling through work with civil society organizations, and strengthens the local recycling industry.

For more than a decade, PepsiCo Latin America has worked to promote inclusive recycling by working with the recycling industry and civil society partners to ensure that recyclers and their associations are an integral part of its recycling efforts.

PepsiCo has ambitious goals for the circularity of its packaging — the food and beverage giant aims to transform 100 percent of its packaging to be recyclable, compostable or biodegradable by 2025; increase recycled materials in plastic packaging; reduce the packaging’s carbon impact; and increase recycling rates with the PepsiCo Foundation and partners. Some highlights of the company’s progress include:
• In PepsiCo Latin America Beverages (LAB), 92.9 percent of the materials used are recyclable. By 2025, 100 percent of its packaging will be recyclable.
• Through its work with Danimer Scientific, PepsiCo is developing biodegradable packaging. This material is currently in pilot in Chile under the Artesanas brand.

The launch of “Recycling with Purpose” focuses on the new consumer incentive and rewards program in alliance with ecoins, an initiative that was founded in Costa Rica that aims to increase the collection of PET materials. Similar in concept to The Plastic Bank, the program allows consumers to exchange their plastic materials for ecoins, a virtual currency, which they can then use to earn discounts on a variety of products and services.

“At PepsiCo, we understand that recycling rates across the food and beverage industry are insufficient. We are deeply committed to becoming part of the solution especially in Latin America and the Caribbean, where recycling rates are significantly below the global average,” said Laxman Narasimhan, PepsiCo Global CCO and CEO of PepsiCo Latin America. “Through this partnership with ecoins, we’re working to make sustainable plastic a reality in the region by creating a circular economy in which plastics become currency, not waste.”

To join the program and begin earning discounts, participants first create a virtual profile where they can use their email address to store ecoins in a virtual account. Participants can then take clean, dry, separated materials to collection centers where they will receive ecoins in exchange for the items.

""Ecoins was created in Costa Rica and launched in 2018 in response to an increasing demand from conscious consumers to be active in solving environmental problems in countries that lack an adequate system of separation, collection and recovery of waste,” said Karla Chaves, director of the program. “It integrates concepts such as discounts, loyalty, digital marketing, gamification, which are so familiar in our system of consumption, but from a new vision: that of the circular economy. The experience that ecoins offers is that of facilitating the consumer's learning of the process of the separation of valuable materials, while increasing the volume and profitability of the collection centers.¨

Through this partnership, PepsiCo will support the expansion of the ecoins platform to 10 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean over the next two years — Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Guatemala and Jamaica. In 2019, PepsiCo estimates that ecoins will have 300,000 accounts and provide recycling awareness to nearly one million people through strategic social media campaigns covering seven countries.",United States,2019.03
507,New study of industry goals reveals pursuits far beyond plastics,"Ask anybody what the most pressing issue is in sustainable packaging and you’re likely to receive some variation of the same answer: plastic waste. It is undeniable that the current state of affairs revolves around heightened awareness of marine plastic pollution.

In response, there is unprecedented momentum around the world created by initiatives such as the New Plastics Economy, and it’s progressed to the point where it seems that any brand owner or retailer looking to make a splash must make some kind of announcement related to plastics, be it committing to 100% recyclability by 2025, upping their usage of recycled content in plastics or taking steps to eliminate certain types of single-use plastic packaging. There is even worry from some that industry has become too single-mindedly focused on recycling and other circular economy-oriented pursuits, with an argument that tunnel-visioned strategies can create blind spots for other important issues.

Yet a closer look at industry goals and commitments, though, reveals a broad and diverse range of focus areas in sustainable packaging, with a few surprises for those believing plastics and recycling have taken over entirely.

Industry pursuits were recently studied and catalogued in the Sustainable Packaging Coalition’s newly-released Goals Database, a resource that is available for SPC members only. The database is a curated compendium of publicly-stated goals and commitments from nearly 100 major brand owners and retailers, containing hundreds of entries under 14 different classifications of pursuits in sustainability and packaging. Each entry is either designated as a goal, which is usually stated with a firm target date and target improvement, or a statement of support, which is a softer commitment without concrete metrics but still indicative of its importance to the company. By tallying up the number of goals and statements of support in categories like recyclability, material efficiency and bio-based material usage, an overarching view of industry priorities comes into focus.

The first major takeaway is that 75 of the brand owners and retailers studied—about 86%—have either goals or statements of support that address one or more concepts in sustainable packaging. Specific, tangible goals have been put forth by 48 of those companies, while only 12 companies studied have not made any public commitments whatsoever. According to the data, transparent acknowledgement of the importance of sustainable packaging is a widespread practice. The areas in which those acknowledgements are made, however, is truly a mixed bag.

For all the buzz around recent pledges to make 100% of packaging recyclable, only 20 companies were found to have made goals that draw a hard line on the percentage of packaging that must be recyclable by a target date. Another four have goals in recyclability with other boundaries, and another 24 companies have made soft commitments toward improving the recyclability of their packaging.

Summing these up, a grand total of 48 companies—about 55%—have made some type of public commitment to improving packaging recyclability. Relative to other categories of sustainable packaging pursuits, that’s a lot—more companies have made concrete goals around recyclability than they have in six other classifications of sustainable packaging improvements, and the combined number of companies with either goals or statements of support for recyclable packaging is the second most of any sustainable packaging classification included in the database.

But not the most.

The most prevalent types of sustainable packaging commitments made, it turns out, don’t address recycling or recovery at all—they address responsible sourcing.

By the numbers, industry places the most emphasis on recycled-content usage and responsible fiber sourcing. More concrete goals are made around responsible fiber sourcing than any other area in sustainable packaging—34 companies, or about 39%, have specific goals—and the number of companies making either a concrete goal or a soft commitment in recycled content usage is more than any other category: 54 companies, or about 62%.

Of those commitments in recycled content usage, only three are exclusive to plastic packaging; the vast majority either encompass all packaging materials or are an extension of a company’s goals in responsible fiber sourcing, addressing paper packaging only.

And while responsible fiber sourcing and recycled content usage are showing momentum, there are many other areas with significant activity. Commitments to reduce packaging are almost exactly as prevalent as recyclability commitments, and goals around eliminating unfavorable substances from packaging are common as well.

Of the 640 entries in the database, commitments to more sustainable packaging only account for about half. The other half are broader commitments to sustainability made on a corporate level, addressing greenhouse gas emissions, energy reduction, water reduction, operational waste reduction and renewable energy usage. When these types of goals are accounted for, they greatly exceed the number of sustainable packaging goals.

For instance, nearly every major retailer and brand owner was found to have made a public commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These types of goals are important, because packaging improvements can contribute to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, water, waste and energy, but it is important to note that packaging is seldom mentioned when these goals are stated. Less than five companies specifically mention packaging when stating their commitments in these impact categories.

It’s unclear if packaging enters corporate conversations around impact-oriented goals, but it’s clear that the concepts of responsible sourcing, design optimization and recovery resonate the most when leading companies set out to make improvements in sustainable packaging.

Zooming back out, we can see that industry has indeed placed significant emphasis on achieving circular economy principles for plastic packaging. But perhaps the buzz around those pledges has created a misperception of an exclusive focus.

Clearly, sustainable packaging is alive and well on multiple fronts, for a number of different materials and many important focus areas. It’s an absolute certainty that plastics and recycling will continue to dominate the industry news, but quietly, companies are continuing to aim at improvements in many other areas of sustainable packaging. And for the first time, the data exists to prove it.

Adam Gendell is the associate director of GreenBlue’s flagship project, the Sustainable Packaging Coalition, a membership-based industry collaborative led by an independent non-profit that believes in the power of industry to make packaging more sustainable. Access to the Goals Database is available exclusively to SPC members.

EastPack 2019 (June 11-13) is the region's premier packaging event connecting professionals from companies like PepsiCo, Pepperidge Farms and Mars with suppliers offering the latest packaging technologies, including a range of automation solutions, from semi-automatic equipment to sophisticated ""smart"" systems.

511,What a Waste,"Our modern industrial economy traces a straight line from resource extraction to manufacturing to sales to waste disposal. Since Earth has finite resources and limited ability to absorb pollution, the straight-line economy is unsustainable; it is designed for eventual failure.

Why not make the economy circular, with waste from one process feeding into other production processes, thus dramatically reducing the need both for resource extraction and for the dumping of rubbish? We should mimic nature: it’s a central ideal of the ecology movement, with roots in indigenous wisdom worldwide. Doing so requires that we reduce, reuse, repair, and recycle—and replace nonrenewable resources with renewables wherever possible.

The circular economy is needed now more than ever. America alone currently produces almost 235 million tonnes of waste per year from homes and businesses, which works out to almost 4 kilograms per person per day. But that’s only 3 percent of all the solid waste in the US economy; the other 97 percent is generated by agricultural and industrial (e.g., mining and manufacturing) processes. If the total US waste stream (including wastewater) is allotted on a per capita basis, each American is responsible for 1.8 million kilograms of waste per year.

Only about a third of waste from homes and businesses is recycled; the rate for industrial waste is much lower, with only 2 percent of the total waste stream currently being recycled. Meanwhile, the 2,000 active landfills in the US that hold the bulk of household trash are reaching their capacity. The US is among the highest waste-producing nations of the world on a per-capita basis, and the federal government has no strategy for dealing with the problem.

Americans should recycle more. Doing so would reduce pollution, slow climate change, and mitigate resource depletion and habitat destruction from mining and logging. But, sadly, the recycling industry faces problems. Prices for scrap metals and paper have declined in recent years (though Trump’s trade war has helped domestic scrap metal prices recover somewhat), and China is no longer interested in accepting metal and plastic waste from the US.

The bigger, systemic challenge is that collecting waste in tiny, mixed amounts; transporting it to a handling facility; sorting it; cleaning it; repackaging it; and then transporting it again almost always costs more and requires more energy than just discarding the stuff into a local landfill.

Waste is what economists call an externality: it’s never an intended, and often not a priced component of the production process, though it does inevitably impose costs—which are often borne by society as a whole. Manufacturers’ mandate is to produce more, and this translates to the strategy of planned obsolescence—making products that are meant to be replaced quickly rather than being endlessly reused and repaired.

What’s needed to circularize the economy? Two things.

First, an overall systemic commitment to the project. That means buy-in from industry, government, and citizens. Make things in such a way that recycling is easier. Focus on extending producer responsibility. Automobile manufacturers, for example, already use a wide range of recycled materials in their products, and like to take credit for doing so. But making the auto industry truly circular will require participation throughout the entire supply chain, support from government via incentives and regulation, and consumer education. Other industries, such as consumer electronics, lag far behind the auto makers, so there is truly an enormous task ahead.

But the other thing we need to do will be an even bigger challenge: we need to ditch the growth imperative. As long as profit maximization and overall growth are the implicit goals of the economy, recycling will remain a boutique industry driven largely by relatively rich people who can afford to assuage their ecological consciences.

If we are to have a truly ecological materials flow, we must start with Natural Step principles. No using renewable resources at faster than replenishment. No drawing down nonrenewable resources. No polluting ecosystems with products or byproducts of industrial processes.

A truly circular economy will be one in which all industrial processes are harmless to people and nature. That means that all “growth” will have to occur in the cultural sphere rather than in flows of materials and energy. We must focus on human happiness rather than GDP; on rates of participation in education and the arts rather than quarterly sales figures.

Currently, we are far from having a circular economy, and that gap is embodied in overflowing landfills and giant barges of trash with nowhere to go—as well as a plastic gyre the size of Texas in the Pacific Ocean. Will the monuments to our civilization consist of mountains of refuse? We can certainly do far better, but that will require us to make a systemic commitment to building a circular, steady-state economy whose aim is beauty and happiness rather than growth for growth’s sake.",United States,2019.03
512,'Too much time talking': calls for NSW waste levy to fund recycling reform,"Ahead of the New South Wales election, the national Waste Management and Resource Recovery Association has called for more of the state’s waste levy to go towards funding a reboot of Australia’s recycling industry to help to end the year-long crisis.

Speaking at a waste summit earlier this month, organised by the peak body of NSW’s local councils, WMRR’s chief executive, Gayle Sloan, said 50% of the state’s waste levy should go back into funding recycling. The president of the Local Government Association of NSW, Linda Scott, said it should be 100%. Currently around 20% of the levy is reinvested into waste management nationally.

Sloan told the summit that the slow pace of change had left her feeling “a little bit frustrated”.

She echoed the sentiments of many in the waste management industry, the local councils, the environmentalists and the campaigners who say that, one year into Australia’s recycling crisis, nothing has really been done.

On 1 January 2018, in what is known as its National Sword policy, China stopped accepting 99% of Australia’s exported recycling. As waste piled up in storerooms, and an urgent Senate review came back with a suite of recommendations, those in the industry saw it was an opportunity to transform the industry.

Sloan was optimistic until recently. “Eighteen months on, I am feeling a little bit frustrated that that opportunity hasn’t been capitalised on and we have spent too much time talking and not enough action … Eighteen months on, we are nowhere close to realising that vision.”

On the same day, the NSW Greens MLC, Cate Faehrmann, said things have gotten worse, rather than better. “Our position is worse, because the government has known about it for a year,” she said. “It’s a year worse.”

Last year, Guardian Australia reported on the devastating impact of the crisis, as well as examining suggestions to reform Australia’s recycling system. These included the potential end of co-mingling, a national container deposit scheme and a circular economy – where everything consumed in Australia is recycled within the country.

Transitioning to a circular economy was a key recommendation in the Senate report, released in July. According to the academic Damien Giurco, a year on the main difference is that “we’ve woken up to the need to change”.

“I think that is a not insignificant step,” he adds.

The NSW government has made an explicit commitment to the circular economy, releasing a draft policy paper in October, and a final one in February.

“The NSW government will implement actions that enable NSW to transition to a best practice circular economy,” the policy paper says.

Projects that increase the recyclability of packaging have already received $9.5m, while the government has promised to “lead by example” by looking into procurement rules that could, for example, mandate a level of recycled content in its purchases.

According to the October draft, the timeframe is to develop an “implementation plan” by 2020, and to “embed circular economy principles in NSW public and private sector decision making, and the NSW mindset more broadly” by 2025.

Giurco says that this is “a good start” and a roadmap for Australia’s circular economy future. He praises the plan for looking at it as “an economic project … not only an environmental issue”.

“The NSW policy statement is the first explicit circular economy statement in Australia,” he says. “I think it has elevated the conversation … [It is] a whole-of-government response. Not just the department of environment, but also the department of industry and premier and cabinet.”

But Sloan and others have seen little progress. “We are not going circular,” she told the summit. “We’re not going anywhere, except chasing our tails, unless we have policy settings and markets and manufacturing equipment and companies that we can actually move the product through to.”

Among the six recommendations, the WMRR called for more government investment, funded in part by the waste levy being given back to recyclers.

But the NSW environment minister, Gabrielle Upton, said this solution was “simplistic” and would drain money from other areas.

“It is simplistic to think that repurposing the NSW waste levy will fix [recycling],” she told the summit. “Dollars alone will not fix recycling rates.

“The money from the waste levy is already being used in other ways across our community ... what are we going to cut if we are going to dedicate 100% of the waste levy to waste and recycled management?”

Giurco says that, while he believes the NSW government needs to move ahead, he doesn’t think it needs to be drastic.

“If we want to send things around the loop – this is a counter to all the buzz and hype – we want to make sure we are doing it responsibly and safely.”

He’d like to see Australia “halfway”to a circular economy by 2025, with a functioning circular economy by 2030.

Other states have made similar early moves. In Victoria, the state government is working on a circular economy policy and action plan “to be finalised by 2020”.

In Queensland, the state government launched Australia’s first “Circular Economy Lab” at the end of February. The project will look at new technology with a $150,000 grant from the state government.

In South Australia, the state government has a dedicated environmental body – Green Industry SA – which is actively advising the government on the move to a circular economy.

One year on, the outlook for a national container deposit scheme is looking rosier.

Since the July Senate report, the new board of the Australian Packaging Covenant has announced support for “the roll out of container deposit schemes nationally”.

Queensland commenced its own container deposit scheme in November. And at the recent recycling summit, Upton sang the praises of the NSW scheme, Return & Earn.

“Almost 1.5bn drink containers have been recycled in just over a year since the scheme began. It is a successful litter reduction campaign that delivers high quality glass, aluminium, plastic and paperboard for local markets and overseas.”

Tasmania and Victoria are now the only states without a scheme – either in action or planned. Western Australia has no scheme at the moment, but will roll one out for 2020.

The Tasmanian Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson, who has been campaigning for a national scheme for 10 years, and fellow Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young have prepared a draft bill that legislates a national container deposit scheme by 2021 – and offers 20 cents for each bottle, double most current rewards.

“The Greens hope a change of government will bring real action soon,” he said. “And we will be kickstarting this with our private members’ bill.”

But the going is still slow. Whish-Wilson was critical of the most recent Coag meeting in December, which he said achieved little.

“The last Coag meeting was meant to finalise a national waste plan, but it turned into a farce with state and federal ministers blaming each other and no funding to help end the crisis.”",United States,2019.03
513,PrimaLoft tests circularity of PrimaLoft Bio fibres,"PrimaLoft, a leading expert in advanced material technology, has announced that its PrimaLoft Bio fibres are renewable in a circular economy. As a result of third-party testing, the polyester fibres have proven capable of being chemically recycled. This process breaks down polyester to its basic components so that it can be rejuvenated into a new high-performance material, without compromising its original integrity.

“The intention of PrimaLoft Bio was always to address the eventual end of life of a garment in an impactful way, while finding a solution for the industry-wide microplastics issue,” said Mike Joyce, PrimaLoft President and CEO. “Biodegradability is an end of life solution that works in harmony with the circularity model. With the ability to renew our fibres, we are changing the conversation to circularity. Circular economies are the next frontier in sustainability, and we have proven our capabilities in this space.”

Third-party testing has shown that PrimaLoft Bio fibres can be chemically recycled with a 95% yield rate. After chemical recycling, PrimaLoft Bio fibres may be reused to produce new insulation or fabric fibres, while maintaining the same level of performance.

Circularity, or a circular economy, is an economic system aimed at minimising waste and re-capturing usable resources to be utilised within the system. This eliminates the need to introduce new natural resources, creating a closed loop. “More than 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic have been produced worldwide, since 1950, and less than 10% of those plastics have actually been recycled1. Those numbers are alarming and PrimaLoft is working on solutions to reduce the use of oil-based virgin polyester fibres,” continued Mr Joyce.

“To that end, we have been using recycled polyester fibres sourced from plastic bottles in our products since 2007. Through this traditional mechanical recycling process, new high-performance material can be created. However, this method cannot be used repeatedly without eventually sacrificing the performance characteristics of the polyester and continuing to use additional natural resources. That’s why PrimaLoft searched for new ways to close the system.”

PrimaLoft Bio fibres are made from 100% post-consumer recycled material and break down when exposed to specific environments – such as a landfill or the ocean. PrimaLoft has enhanced the fibres to be more attractive to the naturally-occurring microbes found in these environments so that they eat away at the fibres at a faster rate, returning the fabric or insulation to natural elements.

516,Global Recycling Day 2019: “Recycling into the Future”,"For the second consecutive year, on what has been dubbed Global Recycling Day, the Global Recycling Foundation is urging the recycling industry to take heed of the UN’s Paris Climate Agreement (COP24 agreement) and continue to play its frontline role in preserving the planet’s resources and improving the circular economy. It is also calling on recycling businesses and organizations across the globe to impress on their local communities, municipalities and governments to take action.

As part of this year’s Global Recycling Day on March 18, the theme “Recycling into the Future” will focus on the power of youth and education in ensuring a brighter future.

The COP24 agreement seeks to promote greater international cooperation, which is a key pillar of the Global Recycling Day campaign. In 2018, Global Recycling Day campaigned for world leaders to commit to seven key areas, including implementing a focus on international legislation, increased education regarding recycling and awareness around the key issues.

“The Global Recycling Foundation applauds the achievement at COP24 in reaching this agreement and the commitment to tackling climate change,” said Ranjit Baxi, founding president of the Global Recycling Foundation and president of the Bureau of International Recycling (BIR), in a statement. “It’s our responsibility and collective duty to protect our planet. Recycling and the circular economy are crucial to achieving this and beating climate change. We also welcome Defra’s new strategy of working with packaging manufactures to promote responsible disposal and recycling of goods—such strategies are key to growing a circular economy.”

“This is the reason Global Recycling Day was launched in 2018, to encourage the world to think ‘resource not waste,’” added Baxi. “And, as part of the Global Recycling Foundation’s mission to support educational programs focused on the sustainable development of recycling, we are continuing to support its growth in 2019. Our second Global Recycling Day 2019 will take place on March 18, 2019, and we urge the world to support this movement.”

Due to the success of Global Recycling Day 2018 with more than 13 million people across the world taking part in celebrations of the initiative, the Global Recycling Foundation was launched by BIR in October 2018.

As communities and individuals around the world come together today to celebrate the second annual Global Recycling Day and as a sponsor of the event again this year, the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI) is calling on businesses, communities, policymakers and individuals to increase their commitment to recycling and recognize scrap as an important resource. Recyclable materials are valuable commodities that play a pivotal role in environmental protection, energy conservation, and sustainability.

“ISRI is proud to play a leading role once again in Global Recycling Day,” said Robin Wiener, president of ISRI, in a statement. “As a society, it is imperative that we start considering recyclables to be the planet’s seventh and most important resource. Recyclables are a resource that can be used over and over again so that we do not exhaust our natural resources.”

“With an increasing global population and growing levels of consumption, conserving our resources is more important than ever before,” added Wiener. “Whether the focus is ocean plastics, climate change, energy consumption, or other environmental concerns, recycling is a solution. Recycling transforms plastics, metals, paper, glass and other such scrap commodities into new materials, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, saving energy through reduced consumption and providing valuable feedstock in the manufacturing process.”

In honor of this year's theme, through its youth outreach program, ISRI offers a number of free resources to teachers to educate children on the science of recycling.

Below are some of the events that have led up to and are taking place to celebrate Global Recycling Day 2019:

Exactly one month before this year’s Global Recycling Day, the Global Recycling Foundation launched the #RecyclingGoals challenge, a social media movement using football to inspire long-term recycling habits in young people across the world.

A step-by-step guide on how to participate in the #RecyclingGoals challenge was created for the public, and all participants are invited to take part.

“Our vision is to connect the strong example the football industry sets for recycling with young people across the world,” said Baxi. “With the #RecyclingGoals campaign, we aim to encourage as many people as possible to share the message of the importance of recycling, actively get involved in the challenge and propel the energy of the social media movement.”

In the lead up to Global Recycling Day 2019, social media users across the globe were asked to participate in the #RecyclingGoals challenge by:
• Capturing a video of themselves scoring a “Top Bins” goal (into a recycling bin in the top corner of the goal or just a normal goal) whilst pledging to make a long-term commitment to better recycling practices—for instance, “I pledge to recycle all my plastic drinking bottles from today, and I nominate John Smith to take the #RecyclingGoals challenge.”
• Sharing their videos and pictures of their challenge online using the hashtag #RecyclingGoals and tagging Global Recycling Day on social media.

The foundation also developed a list of “seven recycling promises to become a global recycling citizen,” which families, school and youth orientated clubs can download and share.

The list also will be available in French and German, with the possibility of it being available in more languages in the near future. The aim is for children, schools and families to download and use these as inspiring messages and motivators to helping the recycling industry.

Worldwide: Nestlé Waters asked people around the world how to recycle plastic bottles in honor of Global Recycling Day.

U.K.: Ahead of Global Recycling Day, HeadStart Primary in the United Kingdom compiled a list of its favorite recycled crafts from around the web.

India: An awareness drive and cycling for recycling took place over the weekend.

London: On Global Recycling Day, #RecyclingGoals activities will take place on Carnaby Street in London. A temporary goal will be set up, complete with recycling bins in the top corners for participants to attempt their own #RecyclingGoals challenge.

Worldwide: For 2019, the theme “Recycling into the Future” will focus on the power of youth and education. The Global Recycling Foundation has launched a special education pack to inspire schools around the world to think “resource not waste.” The pack is designed to make it easy for teachers to plan a lesson around recycling and inspire their students with the power of recycling, outlining various ways in which schools and classes can take part in the worldwide Global Recycling Day celebrations.

The education pack includes a Global Recycling Day lesson plan and resources, including a devised set of materials that teachers can use as classroom decorations and as the basis for a lesson plan on recycling. In addition, foundation also encourages schools to lead a litter pickup in their local area and invite children to get involved in cleaning up the planet in a hands-on way.

United States: Using its all-inclusive marketing and incentive program, Recycling Perks, VERDE is supporting the mission of the Global Recycling Foundation by designing a challenge for children.

The recycling challenge revolves around an interactive video encouraging residents to point out non-recyclables. Residents can join in by following Recycling Perks on Facebook, watching the video and tagging a friend they think might not recycle as well as they do. Anyone following the Facebook page who has challenged a friend will be entered to win five Whale Bracelets. The winner will be able to wear them with pride knowing that their participation in the game contributed to 5 pounds of trash being removed from the ocean.

“We are at a critical shift in the process of recycling and for the program to continue contamination has to be cut drastically,” according to VERDE’s Recycling Perks. “The animated video hopes to engage children and adults while using the classic game of ‘I Spy.’ The game has been successfully used for educational purposes for many years and is familiar to many. In the video, the user is walked through a series of strange items found in curbside bins. Recycling Perks chose to highlight strange items such as garden hoses and dirty diapers to make the lesson memorable and engaging. All of the items included in the game are real items that are commonly mistaken for curbside recyclables! The game has already evoked responses from viewers; they are engaging with Recycling Perks via email and on Facebook and many people have expressed surprise at the items commonly misidentified as recyclables.”

Latin America: PepsiCo Latin America decided to launch “Recycling with Purpose” on Global Recycling Day to reiterate its commitment to a sustainable plastics vision and to propel the importance of inclusive recycling across the globe.

“We share common concerns over the growing threat that plastic packaging waste poses to our communities and marine environments, not only from year to year but decade to decade and beyond,” says Monica Bauer, corporate affairs vice president for PepsiCo Latin America. “As one of the world’s leading food and beverage companies, PepsiCo strives to build a world where plastics need never become waste through a sustainable vision rooted in three pillars: reducing, recycling and reinventing.”

In Latin America, PepsiCo has been working on inclusive recycling efforts for more than 10 years. Today, the company said it is doubling down its commitment by launching “Recycling with Purpose,” a circular economy model for the LatAm sector that includes three important components:
• Consumer Involvement and Education: On March 18, PepsiCo will announce a partnership with ecoins and PepsiCo bottlers throughout Latin America to increase PET bottles (post-consumption) collection. Through this partnership, PepsiCo will support the expansion of the ecoins platform to 10 countries in Latin America over the next two years: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Guatemala and Jamaica. Participants in the program can take clean, dry and separated material to the collection center and exchange it for ecoins, which act like a virtual currency. These ecoins can then be exchanged for discounts on products and services from participating companies, including PepsiCo’s portfolio products.
• Inclusive Recycling: Understanding that grassroots recyclers are the basis of any successful recycling system, PepsiCo said it will continue to work with civil society partners throughout LatAm to ensure that recyclers and their associations are an integral part of this circular economy model.
• Strengthening the Local Recycling Industry: PepsiCo will continue to work on joint efforts with the recycling industry to increase access to recycling materials and will develop agreements with recyclers to buy materials a fair market price to produce new Pepsi bottles.

“Through the years, we’ve learned that as we lack recycling infrastructure in many LatAm countries we need to involve consumers to make recycling a sustainable model,” explains Bauer. “The problem we face as an industry is the lack of recycled PET material to incorporate back into our bottles. That said, today we’re announcing a new partnership with ecoins and our partner bottlers throughout Latin America, to increase PET bottle (post-consumption) collection—making it easy, convenient and interesting for consumers to make an impact, generating an inclusive circular economy.”

In 2019, PepsiCo expects that ecoins will have 300,000 accounts created in seven countries. The ecoins program will provide recycling awareness to almost 1 million people through social media (estimated number of followers) in seven countries.",United States,2019.03

""Together, we can work to develop smarter packaging solutions and combat the global environmental consequences of single-use food packaging.""

""At Wendy's, we know that our customers are increasingly aware of packaging waste and its impact on the environment, and they're already doing their part to be more conscious about their product use and recycling habits,"" said Liliana Esposito, Wendy's chief communications officer, in a statement. ""Our Squarely Sustainable approach is the next step for Wendy's—embracing our role as part of the solution. By sharing goals and regular updates, we'll outline areas where we need to drive progress and hold ourselves accountable to our commitments. One commitment is to engage in partnerships that help us arrive at smart solutions, like our new partnership with the NextGen Consortium.""

Squarely Sustainable, a nod to the Wendy's brand's signature square hamburgers, is the company's four-pronged approach to sustainability:
• Use less and reduce unnecessary materials use.
• Use better and seek certified sustainable materials where possible.
• Spark action by identifying consumer-facing actions that can drive change.
• Engage partners to work with others to find solutions on important issues.",United States,2019.03
524,Continente Pledges To Promote Circular Economy In Plastic Packaging,"Published on Mar 17 2019 10:30 AM in Packaging And Design tagged: Trending Posts Portugal Continente United Nations Ellen MacArthur Foundation

Portuguese retailer Continente has signed up to the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, which aims to promote a circular economy model for plastic packaging.

It is a project led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in collaboration with the United Nations Environment Programme, which will also establish common goals for dealing with plastic waste and pollution.

The announcement of the signing of the international commitment by Continente follows the launch of the first Ellen MacArthur Foundation report, which highlights how brands, governments, and other organisations have established ways to deal with plastic pollution.

Continente is the first Portuguese retailer to sign the pact.

Sander Defruyt, head of the New Plastics Economy project at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, explained, ”The goals and action plans presented in this report represent a significant improvement, compared to the pace of change in recent decades.

“Levels of ambition should continue to rise in order to take real steps in combatting global plastic pollution by 2025, and moving from commitment to action is crucial. Big investments, innovations and transformation programmes need to start now, so we can gauge their impact by 2025,"" added Defruyt.

The governments of France, the United Kingdom and Chile, the Ministry of the Environment of New Zealand and Portugal, the World Economic Forum, the European Investment Bank and the Consumer Goods Forum, as well as several NGOs, universities, industrial associations, investors, and a group of companies that together account for 20% of all plastic packaging produced globally, have signed up for this project.",United States,2019.03
525,Italian Pavilion to connect people through beauty,"The Italian Pavilion at Expo 2020 Dubai will put beauty at the heart of the experience that connects people, and build on the legacy of the Expo 2015 that was hosted in Milan, experts said at the unveiling of the pavilion's design.

The Italian Pavilion, under the theme 'Beauty that connects people', will take up a surface of around 3,500 square meters, and will be over 25 meters tall. In addition, it will be located in an area of high visibility within the site of Expo 2020 Dubai. The international competition for the design of the Italian Pavilion at Expo 2020 Dubai saw the submission of 19 different proposals, and was concluded with the award going to a group of companies consisting of CRA-Carlo Ratti Associati, Italo Rota Building Office, F&M Ingegneria and Matteo Gatto & Associati.

""The project of Ratti, Rota, Gatto and F&M allows us to realise not only an exhibition space, but a space that represents the best of Italian ingenuity, offering a memorable experience to visitors, and showing the world multidisciplinary competences, talents and intelligences that can become promoters of new educational, professional and entrepreneurial opportunities,"" said Paolo Glisenti, general commissioner for Italy at Expo 2020 Dubai. ""The Italian Pavilion will be realised with the contributions of partner companies - large, medium and small - called to provide the best structural, engineering, technological and scenographic components, that are able to demonstrate the most innovative competences committed today to sustainability, to the circular economy, to digital architecture.""

As part of the design, the hulls of three Italian ships arrived by sea shall be overturned and raised one next to the other on tall pillars, becoming the cover of the pavilion. Each of them will be painted in a different way, and from above the design will look like three petals composing the colors of the Italian flag. The pavilion's architecture celebrates the history of Italian explorers who, throughout the centuries, sailed the seas and reached distant lands, weaving together contacts and relations around the world. The Italian Pavilion tells the story of a journey into the beauty of Italy, constant fruit of contaminations, exchanges and connections of knowledge, ingenuity, talent and art. At the same time, the overturning of the hulls is a choice based on sustainability, that also connects to an ancient tradition of seafaring populations and fishermen from Europe and the world.

""Turning over and reusing the ships was an act that had a profound appeal to us: not only because it is laden with historical value, but because it represents the realisation of a circular architecture from the project's beginning. The ships that become part of the pavilion can continue to be used in different ways even after the end of the Expo,"" explained Carlo Ratti, founding partner of CRA design practice and director of the MIT Senseable City Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

""For Italy, Expo 2020 exerts a paramount importance, as the event is an excellent global platform to present to the world the best ideas and projects, as well as innovative models and solutions in the field of tangible and intangible infrastructures focusing on the theme connecting minds, creating the future,"" said Gianpaolo Bruno, Italian trade commissioner to the UAE, Oman and Pakistan. ""Thanks to the legacy of Expo 2015, Italy will surely be one of the main actors of Expo 2020 Dubai, bringing its innovative ideas and creative projects, and enriching Dubai with memorable events.""

Bruno also noted that the Italian love and care for beauty has always been a key element connecting different populations, talents, and ingenuities, and that the shared Mediterranean cultural inheritance serves as a bridge to the future. ""The project would not only be an exhibition space, but a dimension representing the best of Italian ingenuity, offering a memorable experience to visitors, and showing the world multidisciplinary competencies, talents, and skills that can convey new educational, professional, and entrepreneurial opportunities.""",United States,2019.03
526,Overturned ships make up roof of Expo 2020 Dubai's Italy Pavilion,"Designs have been revealed for Expo 2020 Dubai's Italy Pavilion, which draws inspiration from ships and sailors to communicate a theme of connectivity across the world.

The project has been designed by a consortium of Italy's Carlo Ratti Associati (CRA), Italo Rota Building Office, F&M Ingegneria, and Matteo Gatto & Associati, which beat 18 proposals to win the conceptualisation contract.

Located between Expo 2020 Dubai's Opportunity and Sustainability Thematic Pavilions, the Italy Pavilion is expected to have a daily footfall of 28,000 people, with five million visitors expected during the course of the next World Expo, which opens its doors on 20 October, 2020.

The country pavilions of India, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Japan, and the US will be constructed near the Italian pavilion, which will span 3,500m2 and be 25m tall.

The exteriors of the pavilion will comprise three ships overturned and raised sideways on tall pillars, making them the roof of the entire pavilion.

Painted in colours signifying the Italian flag, the three hulls of the ships, when seen through a bird’s eye-view, will appear like three petals, according to Italy at Expo 2020 Dubai.

Since the pavilion is located close to an open park, no structures will hinder views of its front- and side-walls.

Three overturned ships will make up the roof [©italyexpo2020.it].

Commenting on the use of overturned-ships as the roof of the pavilion, Carlo Ratti, founding partner of CRA and director of the MIT Senseable City Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), said that the three structures will be used in ‘different ways’ even after the end of the six-month long expo.

Ratti added that ""overturning the hulls is based on sustainability and circular architecture concepts"".

Remarking on the design of the Italy Pavilion, Italo Rota, founding partner of Italo Rota Building Office, added: “There will be a ‘prologue’ with large spaces inspired by the forms of important Italian piazze, and a 'grand finale' that will be almost like a cathedral to nature, light, [and] the music of the universe, like the sky over the Mediterranean and the desert.”

The pavilion's architecture draws from the historical tradition of ocean-going populations and fishermen from Europe and the world.

Commenting on the cultural representation of the Italian pavilion, Paolo Glisenti, general commissioner for Italy at Expo 2020 Dubai, said: “The project [...] allows us to realise not only an exhibition space, but a space that represents the best of Italian ingenuity.

“The Italian Pavilion will be [delivered] with the contributions of partner companies – large, medium, and small – to provide the best structural, engineering, technological, and scenographic components that [can contribute to] sustainability, the circular economy, and digital architecture.”",United States,2019.03
529,Deal on reduction of disposable plastic dishes signed at UN assembly chaired by Estonia,"TALLINN – The Estonian presidency of the UN Environment Assembly that started in December 2017 ended with the concluding of an agreement on the reduction of disposable plastic dishes by ministers of the environment at the conclusion of the assembly's 4th session in the Kenyan capital Nairobi on Friday.

""What I'm most satisfied with is that my two priorities made it into the joint decision of the ministers of environment. First, states are prepared to significantly reduce the use of disposable plastic dishes. This was among the topics the most difficult to negotiate here, because the UN has 193 member states and not all of them shared our high goals,"" the Estonian minister of the environment, Siim Kiisler, said. He added that although some concessions had to be made in the solution put forward by Estonia, getting the big countries to set the goal of reducing disposable plastic dishes by 2030 was a big step forward.

It is also the first global agreement on the reduction of disposable plastic dishes.

The second important priority for Kiisler had to do with credible and comparable environmental data.

""Knowing how much technology enables us to do today, all of it also has to be put to work for the good of the environment. In order for the right choices and decision to be made, we need trustworthy facts and data which are comparable,"" the Estonian minister said.

A total of 26 decisions were adopted at the assembly chaired by Estonia, more by half than at the previous assembly. In addition to the commitment regarding disposable plastic dishes, decisions were adopted regarding maritime litter, chemicals, protection of the marine environment, food waste, and many other important topics. Also adopted was a decision committing the countries to move towards circular economy by means of more environment-friendly production and consumption.

""My 465 days as president were busy, filled with substance, and eye-opening. Today I can take a breath of relief knowing that our delegation's dedicated work has borne fruit and all ministers of the environment are prepared to adopt innovation and make specific decisions. Estonia's ambitious and action-oriented approach culminated in a more specific and daring agreement than has been the case to date,"" Kiisler said.

The minister also described it as a great victory that Estonia's representation in the UN Environment Program will continue also after the assembly, as Ado Lohmus, adviser at the Estonian Ministry of the Environment and permanent representative to the UN Environment Program, continues his work on preparing for the next assembly.

""This is a great honor because, of European Union member states, only France is represented in the bureau as well. It also offers a good opportunity to maintain consistency on the topics that are priorities for us -- reduction of disposable plastic dishes and developing of environmental data,"" Kiisler said.

In total nearly 5,000 delegates from 173 countries, including 88 ministers of the environment and five heads of state, took part in the meeting held in Nairobi this week. By way of comparison, slightly over 1,200 delegates took part in the first UN Environment Assembly in 2014, and 4,300 in the assembly of 2017.

The United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) is the world's highest-level decision-making body on the environment. UNEA enjoys the universal membership of all 193 UN member states and the full involvement of major groups and stakeholders. It gathers ministers of environment in Nairobi, Kenya every two years.

530,Govt to push eco-friendly firms overseas / Companies with plastic technologies to get support #AsiaNewsNetwork,"In cooperation with the World Economic Forum (WEF), the international organization based in Switzerland that organizes an annual meeting in Davos, the ministry will transmit information related to such Japanese companies at international meetings and via its relations with multinational companies in countries in Europe and North America.

 It is aimed at helping to create business opportunities for Japanese companies, with the ministry serving as a go-between and supporting them as they pursue technological innovation.

 Multinational companies in Europe and the United States, such as German sportswear maker Adidas and Swedish clothing retailer H&M, have set goals of reducing their use of plastics by replacing plastic-based materials with recycled and eco-friendly ones. However, many of these firms have yet to come up with specific alternative materials and are still studying possible materials and production methods.

 The government intends to globally promote Japanese companies that are trying to venture abroad with their plastic-related technologies. Envisaged technologies include those to design products that do not use any superfluous plastics, to develop plastics whose raw material is not petroleum, or to develop new methods for recycling plastic waste.

 The government will begin selecting companies, such as beverage makers and household utensil manufacturers, as early as next month. In the future, the government plans to publicly invite applications from companies, with a goal of increasing the roster of such companies to about 100. Those selected companies will go ahead with their technological development, with advice from a governmental committee of experts.

 These technologies will be publicized by the government at the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy, an environmental activity group under the umbrella of the WEF, in which take part about 60 organizations, including global firms such as Apple and Google, international institutions and governments.

 The government is also considering introducing these technologies at the WEF’s “Sustainable Development Impact Summit,” at which private companies and governmental organizations gather in September every year.

 “We want to encourage business models in which developing technologies that are easier on the environment is a key to success,” an Environment Ministry official said.",United States,2019.03
532,EOIs open for $5m Waste to Biofutures Fund,"Expressions of interest are open for the Palaszczuk Government’s new $5 million Queensland Waste to Biofutures Fund (W2B Fund).

The fund will help Queensland companies find innovative ways to convert waste into bio-based products – creating investment opportunities and more long-term, high-value jobs across the state.

Minister for State Development, Manufacturing, Infrastructure and Planning Cameron Dick said the aim was to make Queensland a world leader in the re-manufacturing of materials to turn waste into bioenergy, biofuels and bioproducts.

This includes utilising household food and green waste, tyres and plastics, recovered fats and oils from restaurants, and biosolids from sewerage treatment plants.

“The Palaszczuk Government is investing in more ideas and more industries like biofutures to create more jobs for Queensland,” Mr Dick said.

“The Premier has driven investment in biofutures in Queensland and we’ve seen a whole new industry develop.

“It’s all about new jobs, especially in regional Queensland.

“The Queensland Waste to Biofutures Fund offers grants from $50,000 to $1 million to develop pilot, demonstration or commercial-scale projects that produce bio-based products instead of conventional fossil fuel-based products.”

“The fund will support projects that transform carbon-rich waste from agriculture, food processing, construction and industrial processes into bioenergy, biofuels and bioproducts.

“Through this initiative we’ll see innovative waste processing technologies emerge that are scalable and can be deployed statewide, particularly in regional areas of Queensland.

“We’re already doing this at pilot plants where we’re converting a variety of feedstocks like sugarcane waste into biofuels.

“These processes are supporting Queensland’s transition to a low carbon, circular economy – the results being improved energy efficiency, enhanced fuel security and reduced emissions.”

Bioenergy Australia CEO Shahana McKenzie said the fund is policy in action and another example of how Queensland is leading the nation in the biofutures industry.

“Supporting innovation is key to developing new technologies as an alternative to fossil-fuel based derivatives, and the Queensland Waste to Biofutures Fund does just that,” Ms McKenzie said.

Mr Dick said the fund has two pathways, both which require the applicant to provide co-funding that matches or exceeds the grant amount.

“The first pathway is the purchase and installation of plant and equipment for an existing or greenfield facility to produce bioenergy, biofuels and bioproducts,” Mr Dick said.

“The second pathway is collaborative research projects that could contribute to the commercial development and growth of Queensland’s biofutures industry.”

The fund is in addition to the Palaszczuk Government’s $100 million Resource Recovery Industry Development Program, which targets projects using proven technologies that divert waste from landfill or stockpiling.

“Both these initiatives complement our Queensland Biofutures 10-Year Roadmap and Action Plan, which is positioning our state as an Asia-Pacific hub for the industrial biotechnology and bioproducts sector,” Mr Dick said.

Expressions of interest can be made via the W2B Fund webpage (www.dsdmip.qld.gov.au/w2b-fund) until 5pm, Monday 8 April 2019.

Shortlisted applicants will then be invited to make a detailed application.

It is anticipated the initial projects selected will be funded within the first half of 2019.",United States,2019.03
534,"After banning fur, Burberry announces plans to be plastic-free by 2025","Burberry has pledged to eliminate plastic by 2025, according to a report published by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation - an organisation designed to help fashion brands transition to a circular economy.

In October 2018, the luxury label joined the likes of Stella McCartney and H&M in signing the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment which aims to reduce global fashion waste.

One of the biggest goals of the project is to ensure all packaging used by leading fashion businesses is recyclable by 2025 - a pledge which Burberry has already acted upon.

According to the newly-released report, the fashion giant will ensure that all of its future plastic packaging is either reusable, recyclable or compostable.

By the end of 2019, Burberry also plans to give shoppers the opportunity to recycle their unwanted hangers in a take-back scheme.

The British company has already swapped plastic lamination on its retail bags and poly bags for garment covers - a move which has reduced the use of 29 tons of plastic.

But that's not at all, as Burberry - led by chief creative officer Riccardo Tisci - has also joined forces with Renewable Energy 100, a global initiative made up of more than 100 businesses committed to renewable energy consumption.

The brand's latest announcement further demonstrates Burberry's commitment to a more sustainable future, as the company banned fur and the burning of unsold goods back in September 2018.

Last year, the luxury fashion house graced the headlines after famously torching clothing, accessories and perfume worth £28.6 million in a bid to protect the brand from counterfeiters.

After widespread criticism, Burberry pledged to reuse, upcycle, donate or recycle all unsaleable products in the future.

As an advocate, organizer, and campaigner for preschool access, tax fairness, plastic pollution and other causes for the last 14 years, I’ve heard this saying many times. You tell it to your volunteers when it looks like your movement has hit a wall or when it looks like your opposition has the upper hand, and you want to show your teammates that many people have faced obstacles before, and overcome them.

The saying is often true, but some of my savvier adversaries see another option.

""First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you... But then, as a last ditch effort, they co-opt you.”

They take your language and your messaging to support something that’s maybe 10 percent of what you asked for (sometimes it's not at all what you asked for). They roll out this half-step with a lot of fanfare. They co-opt you because you’ve won a critical part of the campaign—setting the public frame around an issue.

This is what’s happening right now with the Right to Repair movement. But before I discuss where we are, let’s talk about how we got here.

Increasingly, companies use a variety of tactics to block access to repair. Companies either don’t sell replacement parts, or they sell them at big markups. They don’t make repair information, such as manuals or schematics, publicly available or open-source. They manipulate the software so that if you get unauthorized repairs done, the device locks until the manufacturer unlocks it. This forces the customer to take any problem to the original manufacturers, who can charge whatever they want. This also means the manufacturing companies have all the cards to decide if, when, and how much it costs to fix something.

The result is we tend to repair broken items less, and buy new things more.

A recent U.N. report from PACE (Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy) found that electronic waste is the fastest growing part of our waste stream. Not only that, electronic waste is often quite toxic, containing lead, chromium and toxic flame retardants.

That’s why our Right to Repair movement has hit a nerve with people. Too many of us have been quoted $500 to fix a $600 device, or seen our phones slow down with the latest update. Farmers have been getting fed up that before they can fix farm equipment, they have to pay a dealer to digitally unlock the software that makes that equipment run.

Right to Repair laws are popping up all over the country. This legislation, which would require manufacturers to provide access to the parts and service information needed to fix our stuff, has already been raised in 19 state legislatures so far this year. From Nebraska to Hawaii and Oregon to New Hampshire, people just want to fix their stuff.

Progress has been slow. No state legislature has held a full floor vote on Right to Repair. Manufacturers have gone to great lengths to sow uncertainty and stoke fears about repair. Despite the fact that we line up against trillions and trillions of dollars worth of companies every day, we are making progress. And I know from corporate insiders who talk to us that the manufacturers have gone from dismissive to afraid.

That is why we are starting to see them co-opt Right to Repair.

Last year, the farm equipment manufacturers made an “agreement” with their own dealers on a compromise to Right to Repair. This is another way of saying they agreed amongst themselves. Their “R2R Solutions” use our messaging and our stories to make the case for a voluntary agreement to allow customers limited access to some of what we need to repair their equipment. But because the manufacturers still retain control of what we fix, they still decide the terms.",United States,2019.03
536,Citizen planners: a public brainstorming session,"Switzerland didn’t invent democracy, but provided it a very special context to flourish. Nassim Taleb praises the Swiss system as the most “antifragile” possible. While something that is robust can resist shocks and live on, and fragility makes systems vulnerable to breakdown, an antifragile system gets stronger by absorbing shocks! It can deal with what comes at it in a way that reinforces it.

One of the sources of this antifragility, according to Taleb, is the scale of Switzerland’s political institutions. He describes the country as not even a city-state, but a “municipal-state”. It has the ability to devolve power to local levels, letting tiny territories rule themselves independently while integrating them in a larger confederation, which represents all parts, rather than ruling them.

One of the earliest forms of democracy in Switzerland is known as the Landsgemeinde, where men of a town would go to the central square to debate and vote on issues of common concern. Thus, public space has for the longest time had a political function. It is where people gather and unite, and where a shared sense of purpose and identity is produced.

Last weekend, the city of Lausanne — the fourth largest in the country — resurrected this tradition in a completely new form in order to decide what to do with its largest public squares, Riponne and Tunnel.

Suffering from a bad image due to years of neglect, the area is grey and noisy, crowded with cars, and surrounded by towering buildings occupied by state institutions. It is also known as a gathering space for homeless people and drug addicts. It has many bars and small ethnic shops. Some see it as the last remaining space of chaos and freedom in a heavily regulated environment.

Yet, rather than drafting a master plan for the area from above, the municipal authorities decided to invite the public to a massive three-day brainstorming session.

What’s more, they simultaneously organised an open air exhibition showing how the area had been shaped by 200 years of bad planning. The exhibition fundamentally questions the ability of politicians and planners to deliver good quality urbanism.

Participatory planning is a new form of direct democracy that is rapidly taking roots in many cities around the world. In some Swiss towns it has recently become a legal requirement for all urban plans. The participatory approach acknowledges that voting is a limited mode of expression that can’t capture user expertise and creativity.

What emerged was an effervescence of knowledge and ideas that bubbled from each corner of the perimeter where the event was held.

From a local pop-up radio station, to a daily soup cooking pot which heated up a small bubble room for locals to sit in a circle and chat; from a series of walkthroughs with a local historian, to an art installation that connected the two main squares at the heart of the project by paradoxically playing with an optical illusionary blocked pathway; from contributing to discovering the genius loci of the place (its essential spirit) through an audio archive, to the possibilities of a local circular economy in the neighbourhood.

The material produced now needs to be processed into a brief for the attention of architects and urban designers from all over the world who will be invited to participate in a design competition, to be judged by experts as well as the public.

Regardless of the specific design that emerges from the process, what’s clear is that the public is willing and able to engage with the space and the activities that animate it.

The next move towards direct democracy may well be to produce forms of local governance based not on a principle of representation, but on the principle of collective initiative. More than any grand plan, this is perhaps what these two squares need the most — a more fundamental form of public appropriation.

537,"Plastics, health and saving the environment","An important recent report issued by the Center for International Environmental Law reviews the toxic nature of plastics to human health, from extraction of petroleum products from the ground through refining and manufacture of plastic, then consumer use, waste management and plastic in the environment. Plastics are toxic.

The Kauai Chapter of the Surfrider Foundation has been thrust into the forefront of plastic waste management by trying to determine the best way to rid the island of plastic marine debris while trying to protect both human health and the environment from global climate change.

Our marine debris program collects and weighs over 50 tons a year of plastic nets, ropes, lines, buoys and miscellaneous trash that we need to safely dispose of.

The deadliest of marine plastic debris is derelict fishing gear that entangles, harms and kills marine animals, and eventually breaks down into microplastics and microfibers that are ingested, which can thereby also harm and kill.

According to Kauai County’s 2017 Waste Characterization Study, an estimated 9,595 tons of plastic was disposed of at the Kekaha landfill in 2017. Meanwhile, about 1,255 tons of plastic was diverted from the landfill through recycling and commercial backhauling to the mainland.

We recognize that marine debris plastics comprise a toxic group of chemicals that emit greenhouse gases (GHG) and other substances as they break down under UV radiation and aging; that they adsorb toxic chemicals from the environment, releasing them later; and that plastic has entered into the food chain of aquatic organisms large and small.

Therefore, we do not support developing a circular economy for plastics. Instead, plastic should be removed from usage, sequestered out of the environment, and new production ended.

Furthermore, we do not support the process of burning plastic products (e.g. at H-Power), or fuel made from plastics, to create energy unless zero toxic gases and minimal GHGs are released into the atmosphere.

Plastics should not be “recycled,” they should be “transformed” and removed from the environment. At the moment, the only solution for Kauai is to bury plastics in the Kekaha landfill. But Surfrider is looking for alternatives.

As Kauai County makes plans for a new landfill and continues their waste-diversion efforts, we advocate for the following conditions:
• GHG emissions are minimized in the transformation process, in transporting the final product, and in the creation of any waste;
• The process minimizes energy consumption, heat released into atmosphere, and is designed to produce only a minimal carbon footprint;
• No toxic chemicals should be used in transforming the plastics, nor produced in the process;
• No microfibers or microplastics are produced in the process, nor are shed from the final product;
• The final transformed product is coated, encapsulated, or otherwise sealed from exposure to the environment.
• The process is local or regional, provides both employment to the local community and a finished product useful to the local community;
• The process is designed to become economically self-sufficient over time.

Surfrider looks forward to working with the county and other community organizations to protect human health and the environment while ridding the island of plastic waste.

542,Entrepreneurs voice their concerns in Parliament,"Some of Malta’s top business leaders had the opportunity to voice their concerns and opinions at the first-ever Maltese Parliament of Enterprises, held as part of Parliament’s outreach programme, on Wednesday.

The event, organised by the Malta Chamber of Commerce, Enterprise and Industry in collaboration with Eurochambres, allowed participating entrepreneurs to discuss themes such as skills in the modern labour market, competitiveness, sustainable development and research, development and innovation.

Opening the session on behalf of the Malta Chamber, president Frank V. Farrugia said: “These themes are very close to our hearts. As people in business, we cannot emphasise enough, how important it is for Malta to get it right on these four fronts, in order to create jobs and growth for the country and our people.”

“Our event today is aimed at bringing businesses and our Parliament face-to-face for one morning, so as to enhance dialogue and mutual understanding.

“This initiative provides concrete proof of a will for collaboration between our two worlds. A dialogue, that I augur will span beyond these walls and way into the future, for the benefit of our entrepreneurs, our economy and our country,” Farrugia concluded.

Christopher Leitl, president of Eurochambres, said that entrepreneurs in Europe should be proactive, providing appropriate answers in a world full of uncertainty, challenges and disruption.

He spoke of the important role that business people and entrepreneurs played within the social ecosystem and the need for backing from other sectors of society in order for this role to be effective.

“We are paying taxes, creating jobs, serving the countries and the people within them by doing that and we are proud of that, but we need support from the government, as well as social partners.”

Leitl said he saw a great opportunity for the future and a new kind of economy – the circular economy – which would not waste resources but, in fact, regain them.

“We should be discussing intelligent growth, not limits of growth. Some people may think of the circular economy as a threat, thinking that it will be expensive and incur losses, but it’s a great opportunity for us to be innovative, creative, find appropriate solutions and deliver it to all parts of the world.”

“What matters is not the size of the country but the ideas coming out of it,” Leitl concluded.

Among the speakers was Helga Ellul, former president of the Chamber of Commerce, Enterprise and Industry, who called on the private sector to continue to invest in its workforce through the numerous training and lifelong opportunities that exist even via European membership.

Stefano Mallia, also a former member of the Malta Chamber and current member of the European Economic and Social Committee, spoke about Brexit and insisted that Malta’s priority throughout the whole process is to defend European business interests.

Other speakers included Vodafone Malta CEO Sonia Hernandez, who urged the government to revise the taxation of telecommunication services and facilitate research and development in the sector.

Denise Micallef Xuereb, construction and development director at AX Group, stressed the difference between construction and development and that development did not mean sacrificing Malta’s built or environmental heritage. However, she insisted that there needed to be further regulation to ensure quality and safety of projects and well thought-out masterplans.

Chris Vassallo Cesareo, managing director of Domestica Ltd, said that the free movement of goods could not equate to a “free-for-all” situation, discarding all respect for a level playing field.

Speaking on behalf of the Importers Economic Group, he pointed out that excise duties introduced to give more power to Customs had been used against bona fide importers and merchants.

The session was also addressed by the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition and members of Parliament from both sides of the House.

The event was organised in collaboration with the Office of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and Eurochambres.

543,Global Water Experts To Meet In Sri Lanka To Tackle The SDG 6,"International water experts will meet at the IWA Water and Development Congress & Exhibition in Colombo, Sri Lanka, from 1st to 5th December 2019, to progress solutions and the uptake of innovation needed to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with the dedicated water goal SDG 6 by 2030.

Developing and emerging economies face the greatest threats to their water security. In these countries, increasing water scarcity and deteriorating water quality are critical issues. Global changes such as rapid urbanisation and climate change amplify these concerns. The need for safe treatment of wastewater is fundamental to the well-being of societies, economies, and the environment. In a globalised and connected world, such issues cannot be dealt with separately but must be tackled together.

“With 2.1 billion people globally still lacking access to safely managed water supplies and 4.5 billion without safe sanitation, there is an urgent need to accelerate the diffusion of knowledge, innovation and sustainable water solutions,” says Diane d’Arras, President of the International Water Association (IWA). “Transformational change is required to deliver water and sanitation for all within the upcoming 11 years under the Sustainable Development Goals agenda.”

It is in response to these needs and opportunities that more than 3000 water experts from around the world will meet in Colombo, Sri Lanka in December this year. The IWA Water and Development Congress & Exhibition series focuses on the transition to new ways of managing water resources and delivering water services in emerging economies. This 2019 edition, organised by IWA together with the host country Sri Lanka and the National Water Supply & Drainage Board, deals in particular with drinking water treatment supply, faecal sludge and wastewater treatment for resource recovery, urban and city water services, integrated water management solutions at city and basin scale, and cross-cutting areas that contribute to the achievement of dedicated water goal SDG 6.

“We need to transition to a circular economy approach, where we try to reuse water as many times as possible and where we endeavour to generate value from the waste streams, particularly energy and nutrients,” says Kala Vairavamoorthy, Executive Director of the IWA.

The IWA Water And Development Congress & Exhibition In Asia

 In the Asia Pacific region, home to two-third of the world’s poor, water quality is at a critical stage, as growing volumes of untreated wastewater from households, cities, agriculture and industry continue to be released into the natural environment. This links to the region’s role in the globalised world. For example, 20% of our global wastewater comes from the textile industry, and the dyeing industry is the second largest water polluter worldwide, according to UN Environment. The fashion industry in Asia continues to grow to meet global demand. According to the World Bank, the most polluted river in the world is Indonesia’s Citarum river, which has more than 200 textile factories along its bank. Over the years, the Indonesian government has established several ongoing clean-up efforts as a clean river would bring countless benefits to the ecosystem, economies and societies.

“Unprecedented challenges offer opportunities to implement a new paradigm for sustainable water and wastewater management,” comments Kala Vairavamoorthy, Executive Director of the IWA. “This is particularly the case in emerging economies, where more than 85% of wastewater is discharged untreated into rivers, lakes and oceans. The next 10 to 20 years will be the golden age for solutions for wastewater and sanitation provision in emerging economies. The potential to innovate and implement a step change in approach is great. This will result in improved health of our societies and the environment.”

In Asian countries, as with emerging economies in general, there is an urgent need to accelerate diffusion of innovation and uptake of sustainable water solutions, products and services. This can catalyse the transformation required to deliver water and sanitation for all by 2030 under the Sustainable Development Goals agenda.

The 2019 IWA Water And Development Congress & Exhibition In Colombo, Sri Lanka​

 The IWA Water and Development Congress & Exhibition is the international biennial water event with a special focus on developing and emerging economies – countries with some of the most significant water challenges now and in the future. The 2019 congress is the second of the congress series organised by the International Water Association taking place in the Asia region. Congress participants and exhibitors will explore how policies, regulation, new financial models, innovative research, and best practices from around the world can help meet the growing threats to both water availability and water quality, and make progress towards achieving the human rights to water and sanitation.

The International Water Associationill hold the 6th edition of the IWA Water and Development Congress & Exhibition in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on 1-5 December 2019.

544,A visit from China Association of Circular Economy,"On March 11-12, a delegation from China Association of Circular Economy (CACE) visited Denmark to explore Danish policies, experiences and solutions within circular economy and waste treatment. This two-day visiting started at State of Green’s newly modernised showroom House of Green, followed by site visits at AffaldPlus and Kalundborg Forsyning.

At House of Green, the CACE delegation was introduced to Danish green solutions and circular business models by State of Green, Danish Business Authority and Leaderlab. Afterwards the delegation carried out a site visit at AffaldPlus to learn more about waste treatment. Nils Damsgaard, Head of Communications at AffaldPlus, explained how waste were sorted, disposed, recycled and reused based on environment-friendly management.

The delegation arrived at the Kalundborg the following day. Since 1972, Kalundborg Symbiosis has developed the world’s first industrial symbiosis with a circular approach to production. Today it is a partnership between nine public and private companies. The Chinese visitors showed strong interest in the principle behind the system, which is benefiting both the environment and the economy.

As a major producer and processor of natural resources, China is well aware of the consequences of unsustainable exploration of natural resources and large amounts of waste. China produces approx. 3.3 billion tons of industrial solid waste each year, and only 60 per cent of the waste are recycled or incinerated.

The concept of circular economy was introduced in China in 1990s, and it was accepted by the Chinese government as a development strategy in 2002. Since then the government has been taking action to promote the circular economy. However, China is still facing challenges in the regulatory and economic system as well as with the industrial and technological infrastructure.

“We are very impressed by Danish green solutions, green design and innovations,” stated Kai Zhao, the Vice Chairman and Secretary General at CACE. “China is moving towards a modern industrial system and a goal of zero waste and the Danish model serves as an inspirational reference.”

CACE is a nationwide organisation that was approved by the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs. It formulates strategic planning for the government, industry, enterprises and members, and contributes to building a resource recycling system.",United States,2019.03
548,Where Do We Stand on Circular Economy?,"This year's WasteExpo Collection & Transfer track includes a session titled ""Closing the Loop: Where Do We Stand on Circular Economy?"" The presentation will give attendees a look at recent initiatives undertaken by waste and recycling companies to drive the industry toward its elusive circular economy goal.

Waste360 recently sat down with two industry veterans who will be speaking during the session: and . Quinn is managing director of Closed Loop Partners and former director of business development and sales for Sims Metal Management. Robinson is federal public affairs director for Waste Management.

Waste360: Is it realistic to think that a circular economy can actually be achieved in the waste and recycling industry?

Maite Quinn: Yes, definitely. I've been working in the recycling industry for almost 20 years, and that has always been the goal, especially on the recycling side. As far as I can remember, we've been trying to achieve this because it represents the highest value for material, and it makes sense.

Susan Robinson: The idea of the circular economy is a captivating one because it creates an image of keeping things in motion. People enjoy the notion of a circular economy. But, in reality, I'd say that full circularity is aspirational, much in the same way that zero waste is aspirational.

Waste360: Why is it proving difficult to develop a circular economy in the waste and recycling industry? Are there market forces at work that are keeping it from happening?

Maite Quinn: I don't think anything will keep it from happening. The circular economy concept represents a new way of thinking, so it takes time. That's the main challenge: time. I think we're headed in the right direction. I think we're going to get there. We just have to realize that it's a new mindset, and any time there's a new mindset, it takes time to figure things out.

Susan Robinson: Time and time again, we're reminded that sustainable recycling requires sustainable economics, and in some instances, it's less expensive for manufacturers to use virgin resources than it is to use post-consumer recycled content. Also, in my 30-plus years in the industry, I've gained a lot of respect for the realities of human behavior and the basic desire for convenience in our daily lives. Sometimes we choose products and packages for convenience, not necessarily for their environmental attributes.

Then, there are the issues around the quality of materials. Those of us who live and breathe recycling every day think about this a lot, but most people have other things to worry about, and I don't think it's reasonable to expect everyone to become recycling experts.

Waste360: What are some key efforts being undertaken in the industry to push the circular economy effort forward?

Susan Robinson: We've seen a lot of activity over the last couple years. The first thing that's happening is a renewed focus on quality of material—focusing on having good end markets for materials and making sure that what we're collecting for recycling is of high quality. When we can reduce the amount of non-recyclable material that's collected, we can increase the recyclability of the right things, thus increasing that effort toward circularity.

The other thing that we're doing more is using the concept of lifecycle analysis to understand where we should be refocusing our time and effort. If we're only focusing on circularity as the goal without considering the practical environmental impacts of materials, we may not actually get the best environmental outcome. But with lifecycle analysis, we're using science to make the best decisions on handling materials.

Maite Quinn: One of the exciting things is that we're seeing brands come to the table—brands meaning the manufacturers of the products, the people who are actually making the materials to sell to post consumers. Over the past 10 years, I've noticed that the brands are really paying attention to this and getting involved. They're showing a real interest in adding recycled content. For instance, look at , one of our partners—they recently committed to make 100 percent of their packaging recycled content. That's one great example of stepping up. Another is the Association of Plastic Recyclers' Demand Champions program.

Waste360: What types of takeaways can attendees expect from this WasteExpo session?

Susan Robinson: I think it's going to be an interesting session—to be able to look at some of the challenges and the opportunities and to really think carefully about the decisions that we make and the unintended consequences when we aren't careful in using science to evaluate how we manage materials and the decisions that we make in the short term for the long term. I would hope that we would come out of the session with that—the reminder of how important it is to be thinking more broadly about environmental solutions and decisions and using science to make those decisions , so that we're not just looking toward aspirational goals, but we're truly taking action based on what we know to be the best environmental optics to create the best environmental outcome.",United States,2019.03
549,What role for brands in a ‘circular economy’?,"Five years ago, I paid a woman in her mid-twenties to show me the contents of her wardrobe – for professional purposes of course!

Among the 200 or so items she showed me were a pair of high gloss leggings from a high street store. She had bought them on a Saturday afternoon around a month beforehand to wear to a party that evening. She hadn’t worn them since and only planned to wear them one more time – at most – as the leggings had already lost a substantial amount of their gloss in a single wash. She imagined after a second wash they may no longer be glossy at all and would only be good for the bin.

Not a recycling bin. Not a charity shop donation. The bin in her kitchen.

I asked if perhaps instead she might consider recycling the leggings or donating them to charity. Her response was as stupefied as it was swift: “Who would want leggings that aren’t glossy?” I didn’t press the point any further.

We often hear the opposite story: that as a society we are far more motivated than previous generations to consider the social and environmental consequences of our consumption habits. David Attenborough’s rallying cry against ocean plastic on Blue Planet II last year spurred a popular (media) backlash against single use plastics – particularly plastic straws, which have since been banned by the Queen, McDonald’s, Wetherspoons and Wagamama.

Meanwhile, market research companies like BBMG and Globescan have spent a significant amount of time and effort peddling the idea of an emergent “aspirational” generation of consumer. Representing 40% of the global adult population, this is the group who we’re told prefer experiences over products, authenticity over perfection and use their consumption as a way to signal to big business the causes they believe in.

Despite this, according to WRAP estimates, the UK sends around £140 million of clothing to landfill each year. We buy an average of eight pairs of shoes each year. And we’re no less wasteful when it comes to ‘experiences’: UK households waste over 7 million tonnes of food each year, which means the average UK household is chucking away the equivalent of 21 Big Macs a week.

Given the damning behavioural data, the notion of an emergent generation of socially and environmentally motivated consumer-activists seems optimistic to the point of delusion. If anything, it is members of older generations who are most embracing of sustainable forms of consumption.

A segmentation of the UK population commissioned by the Ellen Macarthur Foundation found that the largest and most wasteful consumers tend to be younger and more motivated by novelty than responsibility. In contrast, the most resource-efficient consumers are those who prefer old fashioned notions of making-do-and-mending. It’s no accident that the poster children of social and environmental responsibility in the UK tend to belong to generations that remember what it’s like to live with scarce resources. David Attenborough is 92 for crying out loud…

Last year, delivery service Milk & More invested £6.5 million in 200 electric vans to help meet the needs of an online customer base that had increased by 40,000 households in the first six months of the year. 90% of their customers order milk in one pint glass bottles, which are reused on average 25 times. This is the essence of the transition to a circular economy: replacing a fossil-fuelled take-make-dispose value chain and replacing it with a system in which valuable resources (including packaging) are reused, refurbished, remanufactured or recycled – and ideally powered by sustainable energy sources.

And although the idea of delivering milk in reusable bottles through electric floats seems like a quaint throwback to the past, their return is part of a broader interest in “direct-to-consumer” (D2C) brands like Dollar Shave Club and Graze, which have both been acquired by Unilever for over US$1 billion. Direct-to-consumer relationships present obvious benefits for brand owners: cutting out middle men means more margin for them; and product manufacturers can restyle themselves as providers of a service, with positive implications for customer loyalty and engagement.

Moving to a D2C model means that Unilever can gain a much better understanding of who is buying its products, their preferences, habits and attitudes. The more personal care and household products Unilever can provide directly to consumers, the more complete its understanding of its customers and the greater its ability to anticipate their needs – just like a friendly milkman.

The circular economy takes the relationship between a brand and its customers a step further than the direct-to-consumer model. Imagine a world where your milkman doesn’t just deposit and collect your milk bottle. Imagine he also collects your empty shampoo bottles and razor blades. Imagine he delivers food and other drinks in reusable containers, which he also collects once you’ve used them. Imagine he collects food you no longer intend to eat and sells it on your behalf to your neighbours. Imagine he collects your food waste and uses it to power his milk float. And imagine that he offers you rewards and discounts for the privilege of carrying out all of these services on your behalf.

This is the vision Unilever is working towards. Not only is it investing in D2C models, it is also piloting a circular packaging concept called LOOP, along with P&G, Danone, Pepsico, and The Coca-Cola Company. The long-term vision for these brands is that they will become a milkman for every product your household uses.

Meanwhile, the likes of Zara, H&M and M&S are working towards a similar vision for everything you wear. If you want to rock a pair of glossy leggings on a Saturday night, they will deliver them in the afternoon and then pick them up the following day to be washed and re-used, re-sold or re-rented to another customer.

These 'circular' relationships present huge opportunities and challenges for brand owners. The potential for greater intimacy, personalisation and loyalty is huge. But in the process, marketers will have to drop traditional ‘linear’ ways of thinking. We will need to think in terms of ‘communities’ rather than ‘consumers’. Supplier loyalty will go hand-in-hand with customer loyalty as the distinction between the two breaks down. The circular economy is also vastly more competitive than the linear economy; while people will have more intimate and involved relationships with brand owners, it’s very likely that this will mean we will have fewer of them.

Large brands like Unilever and P&G are racing furiously to be the first businesses we trust enough to become our milkman-for-everything. They will face huge competition from the likes of Amazon, Walmart and Ocado who already hold a default role as brands we expect to receive deliveries from. It’s very likely that the likes of Google will want to muscle in on the act, too. Ultimately, the winners will be the brands we feel most comfortable inviting into our homes and our lives – and those who devise truly circular models of doing business.

555,First New Plastics Economy Global Commitment Report Reveals Targets and Initial Steps,"A new report published by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s New Plastics Economy initiative, in collaboration with UN Environment, details how brands, governments, and other organizations are tackling plastic waste. The report follows the launch of the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, which established a vision to stop plastic waste and pollution at source by applying circular economy principles.

More than 250 organizations, representing every part of the plastics supply chain, signed the commitment when it was launched in collaboration with UN Environment in October 2018. Since then the number of signatories has risen to more than 350 and now includes Barilla, Tetra Pak, and L’OCCITANE en provence, as well as the Government of Rwanda and the cities of São Paulo (Brazil) and Ljubljana (Slovenia). Financial institutions with over $4 trillion in assets under management have endorsed the commitment.

The Global Commitment aims to create ‘a new normal’ for plastic packaging, with signatories committing to:

● Eliminate “problematic or unnecessary” plastic packaging and move from single-use to reuse packaging models

● Innovate to ensure 100% of plastic packaging can be easily and safely reused, recycled, or composted by 2025

● Circulate the plastic produced, by significantly increasing the volumes of plastic reused or recycled into new packaging

The report shows progress in increasing the amount of recycled content in plastic packaging. The recycled content targets for plastic in packaging jointly represent 5 million tonnes by 2025.",United States,2019.03
558,BIR names keynote speaker for World Recycling Convention & Exhibition,"David Biderman took over as the executive director of the Solid Waste Association of North America (SWANA) in 2015 after more than 18 years at the National Waste & Recycling Association (NWRA) and its predecessor organizations. Since then, he has spearheaded the association’s efforts to champion education, advocacy and research in the solid waste and recycling sector.

Waste Today talked with Biderman about the most pressing issues facing the industry today and what the association is focused on heading into 2019.

Waste Today (WT): Waste collection was once again tabbed as the fifth most dangerous job by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Can you talk about some things SWANA is doing to help improve upon this?

David Biderman (DB): SWANA is expanding its safety program to provide more resources and tools to the entire industry. Over the past two years, we have rolled out our Safety Ambassadors program, which establishes a key safety contact in each SWANA chapter in the U.S. and Canada. This increases the level of attention that safety receives at the chapter level and provides someone who can receive and distribute safety and compliance information from SWANA headquarters about data, regulatory trends and fatal incidents. In 2019, we will implement hauler safety outreach events in many chapters. At these events, SWANA will distribute safety information to collection workers at landfills, transfer stations and other disposal facilities. Many haulers are not SWANA members and don’t have robust safety programs. We hope that the distribution of this information will help change unsafe behaviors and expand the adoption of best practices, ultimately helping get waste collection off the list of the most dangerous jobs.

WT: What has been your takeaway on how the industry has adjusted looking back on the year since the China ban took effect?

DB: The past year has been a major challenge for both companies and local governments as they have adjusted to China’s waste import restrictions. I think most have adjusted successfully, as recyclables continue to move to domestic and foreign markets. These adjustments include slowing down the lines, adding workers, installing new optical sorters and other sorting equipment, raising rates and, in some locations, narrowing the scope of curbside recycling programs. Most importantly, we are educating the general public about the contamination issue, and several communities are seeing dramatic declines in their contamination rates. We need to scale these successful education programs nationwide.

WT: How do you think foreign markets have responded to these changes, and what does this mean for recyclers and municipalities in 2019?

DB: Many countries in Southeast Asia saw significant increases in the amount of recyclables they received during 2018, but starting in the summer, many of them began to impose restrictions on imports as they became overwhelmed with the volume of material. This created a bit of choppiness in commodity pricing in 2018, although the markets have settled down in recent months.

WT: Do you foresee more investment in domestic paper and plastic processing?

DB: There has been a significant increase in domestic paper and processing facilities over the past year. I am aware of at least 15 plants that will be opening or expanding in the next few years. Importantly, a Chinese company, Nine Dragons, has purchased several facilities and intends to process paper in the U.S. and ship the pulp to China.

WT: In your opinion, what more needs to be done to better educate consumers, or to enforce compliance, to improve overall diversion rates?

DB: Unfortunately, many local governments and companies lack the funding to educate consumers. SWANA is working with a coalition of other associations to urge Congress to provide funding for recycling education and domestic capacity. We anticipate it will be considered as part of the broader debate over “infrastructure” that will take place in the House and Senate later this year.

Additionally, the EPA has taken an increased interest in the China/recycling issue, as demonstrated by the America Recycles Day (ARD) Summit it hosted in Washington in November 2018. SWANA will be hosting a follow-up EPA meeting on recycling at SWANApalooza in Boston on February 25 and expects to continue to help the EPA stay informed about the evolving challenges and opportunities facing communities throughout the country.

Otherwise, having more uniform signage on recycling and waste containers would help diversion rates, as would requiring companies like Amazon to use 100-percent recycled content.

WT: Curbside organics collection has been growing in popularity across the country over the last several years. Do you think the number of municipalities participating in these programs will expand in the coming years, or will the tide reverse itself?

DB: Curbside organics programs continue to expand, despite some localized concerns regarding contamination. Because food waste is such a large component of the municipal solid waste stream, and a potential energy and compost source, I expect the number of local governments with such programs to increase in the coming years.

WT: Employment and wages have been improving at a steady clip for some time now. Are you optimistic this will continue in 2019?

DB: Because it is difficult for many in the industry to attract front-line workers, compensation has been increasing. This has been particularly true over the past few years, as unemployment dropped below 4 percent. With unemployment expected to remain at historically low levels through at least the end of 2019, I think employers will need to continue to adjust wages and benefits to attract qualified workers.

WT: On the flip side, employers are struggling to fill some positions. What more needs to be done to bring people into the industry?

DB: CEOs at many companies have repeatedly advised me that finding qualified drivers and mechanics is one of the biggest issues they face. Some employers are responding by using social media to recruit new employees and are reaching out to untapped talent pools, such as encouraging people exiting military service to consider a career in the waste industry.

WT: What is your stance on the number of cities stepping up to ban things like plastic bags, straws and clamshells, etc.? There seems to be a groundswell of support that is beginning to reverberate in some parts of the country for this kind of legislation.

DB: SWANA is reviewing these new laws and evaluating whether any changes to our Technical Policies are warranted.

WT: What are some of the main points of emphasis for SWANA as we head into the new year?

DB: Internally, SWANA will be implementing a new governance structure in 2019, which will be a major change for the association. We are planning for several terrific events, including SWANApalooza in Boston in late February, our waste-to-energy conference (NAWTEC) near Washington on April 1-2, and Wastecon in October in Phoenix. At Wastecon in particular, we are changing our focus to ensure that participants receive a broader educational experience and receive leadership training as well as solid waste-related content.

Besides our events, improving the industry’s safety record and continuing to be an industry leader helping local governments and companies adjust to China’s continuing waste import restrictions will likely be the two top issues we deal with this year. On the safety front, addressing the increase in fires at disposal facilities, likely linked to lithium-ion batteries, is of increasing importance.

WT: Are there any other trends or economic shifts that you’d point to that waste and recycling industry participants should keep an eye on in 2019 and beyond?

DB: We are in the 10th year of the economic recovery from the Great Recession of 2008-‘09. I’m not an economist, but I suspect our economic winning streak will come to an end soon, and the public and private sectors should be preparing for the eventual economic downturn.

561,Startup competitions target the circular economy | SSTI,"The circular economy, a phrase meant to redefine economic growth beyond the current “take-make-waste” extractive industrial model, is gaining attention around the world as a way to produce more positive environmental and social benefits. Over the past few months, three cities have announced efforts to promote circular economy startups. In New York City, a contest will offer a $500,000 prize to the best idea and business plan that seeks to repurpose the city’s recyclables and manufacture a product to sell to the local market. The City of Phoenix and Arizona State University announced four companies will participate in an incubator affiliated with the Resource Innovation and Solutions Network (RISN). Last fall, public sector partners and the university-based Austin Technology Incubator (ATI) collaborated to launch a new Circular Economy Incubator in the region.

These domestic efforts to support circular economy startups are taking place in a global environment where many organizations, countries, and consumers are rethinking their relationship with waste. Notably, China’s decision last year to no longer allow imports of foreign waste materials has prompted a renewed focus on the circular economy in waste-exporting places like the U.S. and Europe.

Announced last week, the New York City Curb-to-Market Challenge (CMTC) is the brainchild of manufacturing serial entrepreneur Chris Graff. As a way to address the lack of potential markets for recyclable materials, the winning CMTC team’s business plan will receive $500,000, with $100,000 in cash and $400,000 in equity investment. The winning team will also receive guidance and mentorship from Graff and a team of advisors and angel investors, which include recycling industry experts and executives at the city’s economic development and sanitation departments.

Launched through a Regional Innovation Strategies award in 2016, the Resource Innovation and Solutions Network (RISN) Incubator in Phoenix offers another approach to supporting the circular economy. With support from Arizona State University and the City of Phoenix, the RISN Incubator announced its most recent cohort of small businesses last week. These companies will participate in targeted workshops at the university, be paired with mentors, and given specific metrics to complete during their cohort term. As these ventures scale, they will be eligible for funding from the Reimagine Phoenix Initiative, which seeks to increase the city’s waste diversion rate to 40 percent by 2020. As of December 2018, the RISN Incubator has supported 13 companies, who have gone on to create 43 jobs, launch 12 products, file three patents, raise nearly $3.0 million in capital, and generate more than $4.0 million in revenue.

The Austin Technology Incubator (ATI) Circular Economy Incubator was announced in October 2018 as a way to “link entrepreneurs with academia, industry, and government to solve global challenges in design and reuse.” In partnership with two city agencies, the Economic Development and Austin Resource Recovery (ARR) departments, the program was launched to help the city meet its waste diversion goal of 90 percent by the year 2040. ATI offers investment, mentorship, and other resources for the four companies falling under its Circular Economy vertical, one of five verticals supported by the incubator.

Abroad, several cities are embarking on their own efforts to support the circular economy. For example, the London Waste and Recycling Board partnered with The Carbon Trust last fall to launch an accelerator program that takes startups through a tailored six-month program focused on commercialization. Other efforts have been launched in Paris, Amsterdam, Oslo, and Geneva as well.",United States,2019.03

565,Plastics recycling technologies compete in circular economy,"A backlash against single-use plastics is encouraging recycling into intermediate products and fuels, complicating world oil demand forecasts

The factors feeding into world oil demand forecasts in recent years have been complicated by the rise of electric vehicles and ride-sharing, a change in world crude quality brought on by the US shale revolution and the challenge of new fuel blends for shipping arising from the International Maritime Organisation's 2020 sulphur restrictions. Now, plastics recycling is likely to further reduce demand expectations as technologies compete to establish themselves as the most efficient recyclers.

Initiatives from international bodies such as the UN and World Bank, and China's decision last year to ban the import of foreign waste, including many plastics, have helped focus attention on the need to review the world's love affair with plastics, and especially with post-consumer plastics (PCP) such as polyethylene and polypropylene, widely used in packaging and quickly discarded. The European Union (EU) last year launched a strategy for plastics in a circular economy, under which, by 2025, 50pc and, by 2030, all plastics packaging must be either reusable or cost-effectively recyclable.

Members of the American Chemistry Council's plastics division, which includes the leading US producers, also agreed last year a target that 100pc of US plastics packaging be recyclable or recoverable by 2030, and that, by 2040, all plastics packaging be reused, recycled, or recovered. Further pressure is mounting from major brands such as Coca-Cola that use plastic packaging and containers and are evaluating shifts to alternatives. Chemicals companies, including industry leaders BASF of Germany and Dow DuPont of the US, are actively researching recycling technologies.

Oil demand forecasts have begun to reflect the concern that such changes will substantially reduce projected consumption. BP's latest World Energy Outlook to 2040, published in February, suggests that a scenario in which a worldwide single-use plastics ban, progressively implemented by 2040, could reduce oil demand growth by up to 6mn bl/d. Until this year, BP and other major oil companies had consistently argued that the chemicals industry would be a key factor sustaining oil demand growth through their forecast periods, and oil producing countries were counting on the earnings from the sector to sustain revenues.

The chemicals industry regards this as a ""licence-to-operate moment"", says Paul Hodges, chairman of International eChem, a chemicals industry consultancy. In response, the chemicals, oil refining and waste management industries have begun to commercialise several long-standing technologies to address the issue. Some companies, such as Austria's Borealis, emphasise the need to recover intermediate products, such as ethylene and propylene, from discarded packaging waste. Borealis has been buying recycling businesses: in 2016, it acquired German firms MTM Plastics and MTM Compact, a post-consumer polyolefin recyclate producer. Two years later it bought Ecoplast Kunststoffrecycling, a recycler of household and industrial plastic wastes into low- and high-density polyethelene recyclates. The company is reportedly working with its key shareholders, Austria's OMV and Abu Dhabi's Mubadala investment fund, to bring its European recycling expertise to Asia, which-with Africa-is a key target for the growth of recycling.

While chemicals producers are concentrating on recyclates, waste management firms and oil refiners have long experimented with waste gasification and liquefaction, in order to produce fuel for industrial processes, onsite electricity generation, and oil refining or blending. In waste gasification, treated and homogenised feedstock is heated into a mix of combustible gases, collectively referred to as syngas, which can be used as a fuel or further processed.

The process is substantially the same as that used for integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power generation from coal or heavy refined oil fractions. Like IGCC, however, waste gasification has high capital costs, which can exceed $150mn for a mid-sized plant, according to a 2013 report by solid waste management consultants Gershman, Brickner & Bratton. Costs appear to have fallen somewhat since then, but remain high. The quantity of waste input into the process is also very large, beginning at 300t/d, which makes it impractical for smaller-scale waste-collection processes.

Plastics-to-liquids technology appears to have acquired the most adherents among oil refiners, as recent interest in recycling plastic waste has grown. This technology involves the use of thermal cracking, or pyrolysis, technologies and catalysts to transform waste plastics into liquid petroleum products, either synthetic crude oils which can be blended into a refinery's crude oil input blend, or a feedstock or blending stock for the production of finished oil products. Because of the use of plastics as feedstocks, the resulting fuels tend to be lower in sulphur than those directly refined from most refinery input blends, helping refiners meet stringent end-user sulphur specifications.

OMV has emerged as one of the larger European companies developing such technology. Its pilot ReOil plant, located at its 190,000bl/d Schwechat refinery on the outskirts of Vienna, produces synthetic crude from about 800t/yr of PCPs. OMV says its proprietary technology produces approximately 1ltr of synthetic crude from 1kg of PCP feedstock. According to Manfred Leitner, head of OMV's downstream operations, ""in the long run a commercial plant with a capacity of up to 200,000t/yr is targeted, depending on the learnings from the scale-up process"".

While the equivalent of less than 4,000bl/d, the crude is expected to provide a consistent sweet crude feedstock for the OMV refinery. ""It is lighter than fossil crude oil. It's possible to maintain a consistent crude quality, with minor deviations depending on the feedstock mixture,"" Leitner says. Should the commercial scale plant prove a success, OMV hopes to roll out the technology to its two other refineries, in Germany and Romania, and may market it through licences and joint ventures.

Delivering PCP feedstock to refineries can be a challenge, plastics-to-liquids developers say, as a logistics chain to deliver municipal waste to the site must be established. Leitner says OMV is negotiating with feedstock suppliers from the waste industry to ensure that delivered material conforms to feedstock requirements and expects supplies for a commercial plant to arrive by rail or ship. He points out that feedstock should contain only minimal amounts of products such as PVC or PET. ""Ideal feedstock contains common packaging material"" such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene, Leitner says.

Further North, Finland's Neste aims to process up to 1mn t/y of waste plastic by 2030, largely using a process developed by its joint-venture partners ReNew ELP of the UK and Australia's Licella PTY. ReNew ELP says its CAT-HTR hydrothermal upgrading technology, which uses water in a supercritical state, allows for an environmentally cleaner conversion of waste plastics to fuels than other technologies.

Companies active in the sector are reluctant to reveal the technical details and economics of their technology while plants are in development. OMV's Leitner says that ""costs per barrel depend on the income generation and the economies of scale effect by future plants with a higher throughput"". Priyanka Bakaya, CEO of privately-held and US-based Renewlogy, says its can produce a diesel blendstock product at operating costs of $30/bl.

That compares with current US heating oil futures prices of about $85/bl. Capital costs, however, appear considerably higher: a 2015 analysis by the Ocean Recovery Alliance suggest that plastics-to-fuel development capital costs may run around $100/bl, in excess of current Brent prices around $65/bl. But the relatively small volumes to be blended into the crude and products pools may mitigate the price effect. Also, some of this cost differential may be offset in particular projects by tipping fees collected from waste management companies delivering feedstocks to plastics-to-liquids plants.

Analysts say current technology suggests such plants are best sited near large urban areas that generate high volumes of waste, with either onsite power generation consumption or nearby logistics which facilitate the consumption or sale of the resulting liquids. Like many other elements of the circular economy, plastics-to-fuels processes benefit from synergies between industry sectors. OMV's Leitner says his company is in ""close cooperation"" with affiliate Borealis and ""both companies should profit from the synergies"".

Industry officials believe that the major market for such technologies will be in Asia. A study by Germany's Helmholtz-Centre for Environmental Research suggests that just 10 river systems in Asia and Africa account for over 90pc of the used plastics carried into the world's oceans. eChem's Hodges says he believes that China in particular holds considerably promise for large-scale plastics-to-liquid technology as collection infrastructure develops around its cities. But he adds that as the technology is increasingly used smaller-scale units may well emerge, along the lines seen in the development of distributed power generation units on electrical systems. According to the Ocean Recovery Alliance, technology capable of converting as little as 1t/d of plastic waste to liquids has been available for years, although its economic viability is yet to be proved.

Global campaigns to eliminate plastics pollution have recently gained traction. In January, up to 30 petrochemicals producers and consumers announced the formation of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste to develop to scale ""solutions that will minimise and manage plastic waste"". The Alliance collects numerous chemicals producers, oil companies and consumer brands, including ExxonMobil, Total, Proctor and Gamble, Sasol, Braskem Petrochemical and Eni.

This year, the pace of recycling integration between oil and petrochemicals companies and plastics recyclers appears to be accelerating. In February, Total said it had agreed to acquire Synova, which makes recycled polypropylene for the auto manufacturing sector. Also, BASF announced its ChemCycling project, aiming to discover means of recycling plastic waste that is currently difficult to treat. In particular, it is focussing on multi-layered plastics structures which are difficult to handle by existing recycling processes because they combine various types of plastic, unlike packaging which is generally uniform.

Recycled plastics-to-liquids volumes are currently low, but each year nearly 300mn t of plastics are produced and most of that volume escapes recycling. Were it fully recycled at a rate equivalent to what OMV claims for its plastics-to-liquids process, it could yield up to 6mn bl/d of feedstock and fuel. Add that to inevitable substitution of plastics by other forms of containers, and oil industry forecasts of continued volume growth fuelled by petrochemicals demand growth look less certain.

BP's own forecasts to 2040 suggest that the displacement could make the difference between steadily rising oil consumption through 2040 and peak world oil use around 2035, towards the end of the forecast period. Oil producing countries counting on a buoyant petrochemicals sector to balance declining revenue from traditional crude oil sales may need to review their planning.",United States,2019.03
567,Playing for keeps: Is designing emotional durability the key to a circular economy? | Greenbiz,"This article is drawn from the Circular Weekly newsletter from GreenBiz, running Fridays.

We all have a favorite thing that stands the test of time. For me, it’s the perfectly cozy flannel shirt that I bought on sale in high school. Despite frayed sleeves and missing buttons, I’ve repaired and re-sewn it more times than I can count. As author and decluttering expert Marie Kondo puts it, the flannel most certainly sparks joy.

Consumerism in a more circular system will require a shift from consumption to conscious use, keeping products at their highest and best state through repair, refurbishment, upgrade and reuse. The challenge? Actually getting people to value existing things over new ones, then to take the steps necessary to keep them in usable condition.

One piece of this equation is the physical durability of an item: Is it built to last or planned for obsolescence? Is it cheaper to fix than buying new? Can it be refurbished at all? (And is it even legal to do so?)

There’s also a less tangible, personal side to our relationship with things. It’s called ""emotional durability.""

Simply put, emotional durability is the idea of designing products that people want to keep. Where physical durability resists wear and damage, emotional durability resists our natural tendency to want the next new thing.

""We are consumers of meaning, not matter,"" says Jonathan Chapman, who coined the term and authored a book on the subject. And it’s not just about the distinct sentimentality of your first car or the unforgettable memory associated with an old concert T-shirt, he says. Designers and marketers can engineer emotional durability into their products and brands.

""The whole marketing approach needs to start with helping people see that we already view material things in this way,"" said Chapman, now a professor and director of doctoral studies at Carnegie Mellon’s School of Design, in a recent interview. ""We are capable of forming attachments, repairing things and keeping stuff. We do it every day.""

Consider Patagonia’s approach to durability: In addition to offering free product repairs, the outdoor gear company features customer stories and photos on its Worn Wear (a re-branding of ""used"") site. In Patagonia’s world, garments embody experience, wear becomes a status symbol and the brand reinforces the connection its customers have to their purchases. Your worn fleece becomes ""better than new,"" according to its marketing campaign.

Emotional durability also can come from the sense that our stuff is special or one of a kind. Whether it’s a tailor-made item of clothing or a beautifully crafted piece of furniture, items that feel unique, age well and endure ephemeral trends can contribute to their longevity. Fashion software company Unmade works with brands to offer ""curated customization"" of products, engaging consumers in the design process while maintaining design control. ""Brands have control but the consumer feels more involved and engaged in the experience and product,"" Unmade explains on its website.

Emotional durability isn’t the end goal; it’s a means to keep the things we want and need longer. Many items — consumer electronics, cars, some apparel and more — will be rented or leased and are best suited for consumer detachment. Accordingly, a more circular approach to most tangible items will require a shift from ownership to experience, supporting the pivot towards products as a service. But if successful, emotional durability could become an extension of brand loyalty as well.

And that makes it another business opportunity in a circular world.",United States,2019.03

570,"New Reports Reveal Details, Impacts of Efforts To Tackle Plastic Waste and Pollution","First New Plastics Economy Global Commitment report offers new level of transparency on ongoing efforts

Details of how brands, governments and other organizations are tackling plastic pollution around the world have been set out side by side for the first time, thanks to a new report published by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF)’s New Plastics Economy initiative, in collaboration with UN Environment. The report follows the October 2018 launch of the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, which laid out an action plan to stop plastic waste and pollution at the source through application of circular economy principles.

By providing previously unpublished data and setting out commitments side by side, this report offers a new level of transparency about today’s plastic system and efforts to stop plastic waste and pollution.

More than 250 organizations, representing every part of the plastics system, signed the commitment when it was launched in collaboration in October. Since then, the number of signatories has risen to more than 350 and now includes Barilla, Tetra Pak and** L’OCCITANE en provence**; as well as the Government of Rwanda, and the cities of São Paulo (Brazil) and Ljubljana (Slovenia). Financial institutions with over US$4 trillion in assets under management have endorsed the commitment.

The Global Commitment aims to create ‘a new normal’ for plastic packaging, with signatories committing to:
• Learn more from WWF, National Geographic, Valutus and more on efforts to rethink the plastics value chain and strive for plastic neutrality — at SB'20 Long Beach. Tell me more! Eliminate problematic or unnecessary plastic packaging and move from single-use to reuse packaging models
• Innovate to ensure 100 percent of plastic packaging can be easily and safely reused, recycled, or composted by 2025
• Circulate the plastic produced, by significantly increasing the volumes of plastic reused or recycled into new packaging

As EMF points out, the decision by more than 30 companies to publicly disclose their annual plastic packaging volumes in the report is an important step towards greater transparency, but the Foundation is now urging all companies that make and use plastics to disclose their plastics footprint.

The report shows welcome progress in increasing the amount of recycled content in plastic packaging, and the phasing out of non-recyclable materials. The recycled content targets for plastic in packaging jointly represent 5 million tonnes by 2025.

This is the biggest-ever commitment to use recycled plastics in packaging and provides clear demand for increased investment in high-quality recycling and will result in a significant reduction in production of virgin plastics.

However, while improving recycling is crucial, we cannot recycle our way out of the plastics issues we currently face. Elimination of problematic or unnecessary plastic packaging through redesign, innovation, and new delivery models is a priority. Reuse

models need to be applied where relevant, reducing the need for single-use packaging. All of this is an explicit part of the Global Commitment vision, endorsed by all 350+ signatories.

New Plastics Economy lead Sander Defruyt said: “The targets and action plans set out in this report are a significant step forward compared with the pace of change of past decades. However, they are still far from truly matching the scale of the problem, particularly when it comes to elimination of unnecessary items and innovation towards reuse models. Ambition levels must continue to rise to make real strides in addressing global plastic pollution by 2025, and moving from commitment to action is crucial. Major investments, innovations, and transformation programmes need to be started now, to realise the impact by 2025.”

Lisa Svensson, Coordinator of the Marine and Coastal Ecosystems Branch at UN Environment, said: “UN Environment is delighted to be working with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to help turn the tide on plastic pollution. Within just a few months of the launch of the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment we have seen important progress. The Foundation's work to create a circular economy for plastic aligns very well with our Clean Seas campaign, which has become the biggest global compact addressing marine plastic.”

National-level efforts to put the Global Commitment’s vision into practice include a growing network of Plastic Pacts. These collaborations between government, NGOs, and businesses focus on creating country-specific circular economy solutions to plastics waste. The UK launched the first Plastics Pact in April 2018 and the French pact was launched last month. The Chilean government has announced plans to do the same later this year. All countries are signatories to the Global Commitment.

As an endorser of the Global Commitment, the World Economic Forum on Monday (March 11) launched the Global Plastics Action Partnership in Indonesia.

EMF says the New Plastics Economy will publish a further report on signatory progress in Autumn 2019, and every year following.

Meanwhile, Closed Loop Partners (CLP) — home of the Closed Loop Fund and Closed Loop Ventures — today released its 2018 impact report. The fourth annual report comes at a time when CEOs of major consumer goods companies are recognizing — as seen through burgeoning engagement in initiatives such as the New Plastics Economy — that the development of circular supply chains will reduce manufacturing costs and provide consumers with more sustainable products; and more and more major consumer goods companies are establishing strategies to that effect.

“Recycling infrastructure has not kept up with the velocity of packaging innovation,” John Caturano, Senior Sustainability Manager of Packaging at Nestlé, says in the report. “Closed Loop Fund is helping companies like Nestlé remedy this with progressive investments that add more infrastructure in North America, so our consumers can recycle our packages, and we can use recycled content in our packages.”

From the beginning, CLP has worked to connect municipalities, companies and investors in an effort to build stronger relationships and accelerate the creation of circular supply chains. Along with corporates, mayors of major municipalities are also recognizing that local recycling and circular infrastructure are vital for the health and wellbeing of their cities, as they reduce municipal disposal budgets, generate revenue and drive local manufacturing and job creation.

At the close of 2018, CLP’s portfolio included 36 investments — 21 investments from the Closed Loop Fund and 15 investments from Closed Loop Ventures. The Impact Report measures the effect these investments are having on reducing GHG emissions, diverting valuable commodities from landfill and back into circular supply chains, and creating jobs. According to the report, for every dollar invested to date:
• $4 of co-investment was generated from private and public sources
• 300 pounds of recyclables were recovered and returned to a supply chain, and

In 2018, CLP launched the Center for the Circular Economy (CCE), its advisory services group. One of CCE’s first initiatives, The NextGen Consortium — a pre-competitive collaboration among consumer brands including Starbucks, McDonald’s, The Coca-Cola Company, Yum! Brands, Wendy’s and Nestlé, committed to advancing food-service packaging solutions — recently named 12 winning solutions to its NextGen Cup Challenge, which could all help eliminate coffee cup waste.

In addition to the Cup Challenge, CLP also partnered with the Sustainable Packaging Coalition on the Flexpack Recovery Innovation Challenge, a solution search for multilayer flexible film packaging, a plastic type not currently recycled in most markets. At the launch of the Challenge, Amazon announced a $10 million investment into the Closed Loop Fund, to support the improvement of recycling infrastructure across the US.

“Amazon is committed to being part of the circular economy, and our investment in Closed Loop Fund is one way we are working to increase ease and access of recycling options,” said Terese Kietzer, Amazon’s Senior Manager of Sustainability Services. “These investments will not only divert millions of pounds from landfills, but will also help support local communities and preserve our natural resources. We are proud to support the Closed Loop Fund’s mission to bring better recycling infrastructure to millions of households across the country.”",United States,2019.03
571,Melco signs up to Global Commitment to tackle plastics pollution,"MACAU, March 14, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited announced that it is the first and only hospitality group and integrated resort operator globally to become a signatory to The New Plastics Economy Global Commitment ('Global Commitment'), led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in collaboration with UN Environment. This announcement coincides with the first official progress report* published by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation around this global initiative to eliminate plastics waste and pollution. Driven by Melco’s strong focus around environmental sustainability which is core to its strategy and daily operations, Melco is committed to reducing the use of problematic plastics and promoting circular economy across its global operations, including at integrated resorts City of Dreams Macau, Studio City, Altira Macau and City of Dreams Manila, as well as its corporate offices and properties in Hong Kong, Macau, the Philippines and Japan. 



The New Plastics Economy Global Commitment was first launched in October 2018, spearheaded by Ellen MacArthur Foundation in collaboration with UN Environment and supported by World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), World Economic Forum and Consumer Goods Forum, among others. The Global Commitment addresses the worldwide issue of plastics pollution. With plastics weighing 8 million tonnes entering the ocean each year, if current trends continue, there could be more plastics than fish (by weight) in the sea by 2050. The initiative enables a coalition between governments and companies committed towards 100% reusable, recyclable, or compostable plastic packaging by 2025. Businesses that become signatories will publish annual data on their progress, and targets will be reviewed every 18 months and amplified over time.

As a signatory, Melco is committed to eliminating unnecessary plastic packaging and reducing single-use plastics. By the end of 2019, Melco will remove 100% of single-use plastic bottles at all employee areas. By the end of 2020, Melco plans to expand the scope to guest areas including for amenity kits, garbage bags, plastic bottles, straws, disposable F&B containers and utensils with a concrete roadmap. Furthermore, by mid-2019, Melco will complete the process of identifying non reusable, recyclable, or compostable packaging, and further develop an execution plan to address each of these by 2025.

In support of this initiative, Mr. Lawrence Ho, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Melco Resorts & Entertainment said, “We recognize plastic pollution is a global challenge and will endeavor to eliminate problematic plastic by placing this at the forefront of our sustainability efforts. As a leading integrated resort operator and responsible corporate citizen, it is our duty to take concrete action by helping resolve some of the key environmental threats facing communities around us, in Macau and beyond.

581,"Backacia, the construction industry’s own “Ebay”","This online marketplace means construction industry professionals can give a second life to their building site surpluses and demolition waste.

With waste production standing at almost

Based on this observation, in August 2017 Késia Vasconcelos, a former works manager, and Lucile Hamon, an entrepreneur specializing in waste recovery, decided to set up a B2B marketplace dedicated to reusing materials from demolitions and building project surpluses. The idea is to facilitate the sale of second-hand materials and equipment to prevent them ending up in dumpsters.

Backacia therefore puts the sellers who own these resources in contact with potential buyers through a digital platform providing secure online transactions. All the website users are construction and real estate professionals - from large groups, SMEs and sole traders.

The first benefit for users of this construction “Ebay” is of course financial. Sellers reduce their waste management costs and generate additional income; buyers benefit from cheaply priced professional quality products. Backacia also allows users to bring the circular economy into their building projects and implement high-impact actions.

A 2008 European waste directive (transposed in France in the energy transition for green growth law of August 17, 2015) requires the construction sector to recycle 70% of building waste. Currently, this stands at only 35%. In France,

The start-up has already attracted numerous customers, won several awards and attracted the interest of large construction groups. The next steps include a first fund raising campaign to fund development outside Île-de-France, recruiting new employees and developing new features on the platform. The two founders hope to be completing 26,000 transactions a year within three years.

586,Flexible packaging recycling? These firms offer hope,"Recently announced finalists in the FlexPack Recovery Challenge use a variety of recycling technologies – both mechanical and chemical – to recover an often-landfilled material.

The Sustainable Packaging Coalition (SPC) and The Center for the Circular Economy at Closed Loop Partners on March 6 announced they’ve selected five finalists for the competition. They include both U.S. and European startups.

The FlexPack Recovery Challenge seeks to help commercialize promising technologies for recycling multi-material flexible packaging, which is becoming increasingly common on store shelves but is usually landfilled or burned. The package type includes such items as stand-up pouches, chip bags, wraps and other multi-layer films.

The winner of the challenge will be decided in April, and that entity will receive a year-long SPC membership and entrance into a mentorship program administered by Closed Loop Partners and SPC.

The five finalists in the competition are:

EcoGlobal: This U.S. company has a mechanical recycling technology that processes a mix of LDPE and other materials into its Ekopolimer brand material. The company’s product has been used as access mats for construction and other sectors, shipping crates, walkways and low-impact roads, storm drains and other products in the construction and agriculture industries.

Cadel De-Inking: This Spanish company became a finalist in the challenge for its delamination process combining elements of both mechanical and chemical recycling, according to the competition release. It has recently applied the technology to separating PE and PET and metalized BOPP from BOPP. Plastics Recycling Update in 2017 wrote about an earlier iteration of the technology.

ReNewELP: This U.K. company employs a chemical conversion technology to process mixed plastics into synthetic crude oil, chemicals and waxes. The company’s process uses what’s called a catalytic hydrothermal reactors (Cat-HTR), which leverage water at high pressure and temperature.

Synova and BioBTX: These Netherlands-based companies are partnering to combine their chemical conversion technologies using both gasification and pyrolysis, as well as gas cleaning, the press release states. The goal is to specifically address multi-material flexible packaging, converting it to feedstock for plastic production (benzene, toluene, xylene and styrene).

Renewlogy: This U.S. company uses a pyrolysis technology to convert low-grade plastics into fuel and petrochemical feedstocks. The equipment used is modular and can be scaled up in increments of 10 tons per day. Plastics Recycling Update reported in February that the city of Phoenix is considering selecting Renewlogy to operate a program for diverting plastics Nos. 3-7 from landfill.

For the FlexPack Recovery Challenge finalists, the next step will be presenting during the SPC Impact 2019 conference, to be held in Seattle in early April.

SPC, which counts a number of major packaging stakeholders as members, is a project of environmental nonprofit group GreenBlue. Started with funding from major consumer goods companies, Closed Loop Partners is a nonprofit group that invests in sustainable consumer goods, recycling technologies and development of the circular economy.

The FlexPack Recovery Challenge isn’t the only high-profile effort to enable widespread recycling of multi-material flexible packaging. The Material Recovery for the Future (MRFF) project is testing the ability of a MRF in Pennsylvania to effectively sort flexible packaging into distinct bales for eventual recycling.

Additionally, a number of global plastic and packaging manufacturers have released versions of multi-layer films, including those used for stand-up pouches, that are recyclable through PE bag drop-offs at stores across the country.

587,Petrochem giants open up on 'plastics waste problem',"Executives from large resin makers say circular economy principles are key to their companies’ long-term viability. Putting such a strategy into action will be no easy task, however.

“We’re all as an industry trying to define what circular means,” said Patricia Drake, marketing manager polypropylene North America for petrochemical giant LyondellBasell. “We all know we have a large plastics waste problem that’s not going away. That’s heard at the highest level.”

Drake and other petrochemical leaders took to the stage in the opening session of the Plastics Recycling Conference and Trade Show, which is being held this week at the Gaylord National near Washington, D.C.

And the discussion was well-timed. Over the last year, public concern about plastic waste, particularly marine debris, has ramped up considerably in the U.S. and across the world. In concert with that fact, governments of all sizes have taken action to curb use of single-use plastics.

In addition, brand owners have continued pushing higher recycled content goals while also making moves to show their businesses are responding to the wider pollution outcry.

Resin makers say that has all put them in a position where there is no longer any question whether they should be investing in the recycling chain.

“You’ve got to make a product the market wants,” said Jon Timbers, director of innovation and sustainability at styrene manufacturer Americas Styrenics. “You have to meet consumer demand. To include recycled content or not? That’s a non-starter. The consumer is demanding there has to be recycled content in the product and it has to be recyclable.”

But meeting sustainability demands is far from straightforward for plastic resin stakeholders.

Many emerging types of plastic packaging, such as multi-layer flexible films, don’t fit well into the existing recycling infrastructure. And contamination continues to plague streams of recycled plastics that do have proven value.

“We’ve got to have a way to get materials collected; we as an industry do a horrible job of this,” said Jeff Warmann, president and CEO of Monroe Energy, an oil refiner that also operates a plastic-to-fuel operation. “We don’t make it easy for people to do that.”

To handle such complications, some resin players have invested in chemical recycling technologies. Chemical recycling, which brings recovered plastics back down to the monomer level, is in its infancy, but its backers say it holds promise for offering a more circular solution for harder-to-recycle materials.

However, pushing forward in that space will likely require continued investment – and a lot of patience – and it remains unclear how the petrochemical sector will be able to communicate the benefits of the strategy to consumers and other decision-makers.

“Chemical recycling is not viewed as true recycling in the eyes of, let’s say, the [Federal Trade Commission],” said Ted Harris, technical service and sustainability manager at Total Petrochemicals & Refining. “There’s some work that needs to be done to ensure that monomers created through this process and back into packaging does count as recycled content.”

Another factor is the confusion that often gets created when different product and packaging manufacturers cherry-pick data from research to back up their sustainability claims.

“We create a mess in the market and the consumer’s mind when we give them these conflicting studies in environmental impact,” said Timbers of Americas Styrenics.

Nevertheless, it’s clear that resin companies are not being shy about putting their resources behind technologies and companies that hold hope in the sustainable packaging space.

Total, for instance, recently purchased French PP recycling operation Synova. And LyondellBasell has invested in Netherlands-based Quality Circular Polymers, which describes its vision as becoming “the leading European supplier of circular polymer compounds.”

Large plastics stakeholders also announced in January they are putting up to $1.5 billion behind a new initiative called the Alliance to End Plastic Waste.

Underneath all the action is the simmering threat that some plastic products will be eschewed by society in general.

LyondellBasell’s Drake said that while her company is certainly keeping an eye on recent moves by governments to ban some single-use plastics, the resin maker’s major focus is on finding pathways to producing the packaging that the market is asking for.

“It’s innovate or die,” Drake said. “We’re looking for what our product is best suited for, rather than trying to hold on to what may be a sunsetting application.”",United States,2019.03
588,EPRO names sustainability in plastics recycling award winners,"The European Association of Plastics Recycling & Recovery Organizations (EPRO), Brussels, announced the winners of the EPRO biennial awards at the IndentiPlast gala dinner March 7 in London. According to an EPRO news release, the awards are aimed at recognizing innovative and sustainable plastic products. The winning entries were presented with trophies made from recycled plastic yogurt containers by PlasticsEurope President Javier Constante from Dow Europe.

“I can only commend everyone for their innovations within plastics circularity,” Constante said at the gala dinner. “Their forward-thinking approach and entrepreneurial spirit are proof that we are on the right track to enabling the new plastics economy.”

Orkla Home and Personal Care, Oslo, Norway, won the Sustainability category with the Jordan Green Clean Toothbrush, which is gaining positive responses from consumers. According to EPRO, the toothbrush handle is made of postconsumer, food-grade recycled plastic, and the filaments are Nylon 1010 and 100 percent bio-based.

“We are delighted to have won this important award, especially given the tough competition,” said Daniel Bondeson, senior product developer of Orkla Home and Personal Care. “We hope this award will inspire designers, manufacturers and other key players to continue the journey for more circular thinking when developing products still answering to trends and quality. We also hope that the recognition of this product will highlight the need for better infrastructure and sorting of [recyclables].”

Alpla Werke, Alwin Lehner GmbH & Co. KG, Hard, Austria, received the award in the Innovation category for “The Simple One.” The bottle design does not have the need for a cap, is 60 percent lighter than conventional high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles and can be used for refills or single-use packaging. Produced from a single layer of HDPE, the pack itself is 100 percent recyclable.

“With the reduction of material and careful selection of recyclable material, The Simple One underlines Alpla’s efforts for an environmentally conscious use of resources,” said Michael Heyde, head of recycling technology at Alpla.

“Both winning products are very innovative and great ambassadors for plastic recycling,” added EPRO Secretary General Peter Sundt. “We wish the winners and all the other 47 participants good luck with their products and further efforts towards a circular economy. We need such frontrunners that can lead the way.”",United States,2019.03
589,AQUA pushes ahead with efforts to promote wise plastic use,"AQUA, a bottled mineral water brand manufactured by PT Tirta Investama, is taking further steps to advance its plastic bottle recycling program. After partly implementing the program, it will soon implement it fully through the production of its 100 percent recycled plastic bottle, the first in Indonesia and among the first in the world.

AQUA is committed to accelerating innovation in packaging to solve the plastic waste pollution challenge in Indonesia.

AQUA will launch its new 100 percent recycled 1.1 liter plastic bottle primarily in Bali and begin distribution in Jakarta in the second half of 2019. It is currently impossible to make all our water bottles from 100 percent rPET, but AQUA is committed to moving in that direction by taking small steps along the way, starting with the launch of the new bottle in Bali.

Consumers appreciate brands that are committed to protecting the environment. AQUA is one such brand, which has shown its commitment to sustainability through the implementation of its 100 percent recycled plastic bottle project. It will be sold with a bare presentation, without any additional plastic labelling or decoration. The initiative represents a step forward toward creating a cleaner Indonesia and an active effort to reduce plastic waste through innovation.

According to the Environment and Forestry Ministry, Indonesians throw away around 9 million tons of plastic every year, with most of it ending up in landfills, clogging waterways or being washed into the ocean, damaging marine life.

The government aims to reduce plastic waste by 70 percent by 2025 and it has also committed up to US$1 billion annually to remove plastic debris from its seas. The plastic bottle recycling project will help the Indonesian government reduce plastic waste, especially waste that already pollutes the ocean, and meet its target of reducing carbon emissions as plastic is made from the derivatives of fossil fuels.

The continued burning of fossil fuels has been blamed as a cause of air pollution and climate change. Some surveys have even concluded that air pollution is cutting global life expectancy by an average of 1.8 years, making it the world's top killer after smoking cigarettes.

Besides protecting the environment, the project is also aimed at promoting the development of a circular economic system in Indonesia. The 100 percent recycled plastic bottle is part of the pioneering efforts of AQUA, the oldest and largest bottled mineral water brand in Indonesia, to generate higher growth of the circular economy. It has recently announced a series of new commitments and actions to ensure its packaging will become 100 percent circular and to accelerate the global transition toward a circular economy of packaging.

AQUA will accelerate its transition toward the circular economy in three ways. First, initiatives to improve product design and develop alternative delivery and reuse models.

Second, investments to develop effective, efficient and inclusive systems for increased collection and recycling. To boost plastic reuse, recycling and composting, AQUA recognizes that design will not be enough to make its packaging fully circular. Effective collection and recycling systems are essential to ensuring packaging is recycled, reused or composted.

Third, actions to preserve natural resources by reintegrating recycled materials into its packaging and using renewable materials.

Transitioning to a circular economy means seeking to no longer use packaging from finite resources. This helps preserve natural resources and keep existing packaging materials in use and out of nature. Using recycled materials is a key component of this.

Hopefully, it will create a new culture of recycling and reusing under the circular economic principle, which will be increasingly popular among Indonesians.",United States,2019.03
591,Customers Can Now Get IKEA Furniture on a Lease,"IKEA is a massive company that generally designs and sells furniture that can be easily assembled by the buyers. It was founded 1943 in Sweden and is successfully operating until the present. The Swedish company has franchise branches across different countries. Its popularity is evident from the constant mention of the brand in countless present-day television shows. Some of its most popular models are the Billy bookcase and the Malm bed.

The basic idea was for buyers to visit IKEA showrooms and compare assembled models. An unassembled kit of their chosen furniture model would be packed for them to take home or would be delivered to their address. This has been the trend and flow of furniture retail for a very long time.

However, last year in 2018, the retail giant suffer a major financial blow prompting the need to reevaluate their business strategies. Shifting from a purely retail system, IKEA has decided to adapt furniture leasing for 2019. This strategy is two-pronged as it allows to deal with the disruption the company experienced in 2018, and it also gives them the chance to shift from a linear to a circular economy system.

The trend, as observed, is that more people are opting for leased products. IKEA is not the first company to adapt to a circular economy. An example is a cab-hailing system like Uber where more operators prefer to lease a vehicle as this allows them to update their technology and keep their machines up to date.

IKEA's Product-as-a-Service (PaaS) would be put to trial during the year bringing forth a number of great benefits for the consumers, as well as the company.

Perhaps the best one is the increase in their recycling levels. The company would be working towards their ultimate goal which is to keep a closed loop on their materials. This means that IKEA would take up recovering materials which they can repurpose from their used products. This may also open the possibility for IKEA to involve their consumers in developing new products.

The PaaS strategy also allows IKEA designers to improve on furniture longevity, reusability, and material sharing because the furniture would be handed over from one customer to another. The products should, therefore, withstand this change in environment and use. This also means that the designs would be more innovative so that restructuring into a new model design would be possible and easy.

The changes in trends and the demands posed by these changes bring about a disruption in the economy. IKEA has managed to use this disruption to improve its furniture products and retail system altogether.",United States,2019.03

594,Recycle or Reuse? Will Loop Redefine the Circular Economy?,"The last year has seen rapid development in the construction of a circular economy in plastics, with most of the leading brand owners and many of the leading converters and chemical companies making substantive pledges on recyclability and value-chain collaborations such as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and CEFLEX mapping out how to marry design for recyclability with a viable recycling economy. Meanwhile, some voices suggest that even universal recycling of plastics would be no panacea. The recent launch of Loop™ by TerraCycle and a coalition of CPG giants has the potential to bring reusable packaging to the mainstream – and raises big questions about the relative merits of recycling vs. reuse.

Launched at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Loop is an online shopping concept that challenges our reliance on single use packaging. As Packaging Europe reported earlier this year, Loop proposes to send consumers products in customised, durable packaging, which is subsequently collected for reuse rather than recycling. Loop’s vision of an inverted ownership model, wherein brands retain ownership of the packaging, not only benefits sustainability but presents an opportunity to invest in high-end materials that enhance consumer experience.

“Recycling is critically important and using recycled material is an important short-term step but it doesn’t solve our core waste problems,” TerraCycle’s CEO Tom Szaky told Packaging Europe in January. “One of the starting points for Loop was questioning the idea of consumers owning the packaging of the products they buy. This provides an incentive for the manufacturer to make it cheaper, and the cheaper and lighter it is, the less economical it is to recycle. On the other hand, if the manufacturer takes ownership and responsibility, packaging starts to be treated as an asset in the P&L.”

Disposable packaging became popular in the 1950s as it promised a cheaper, more convenient lifestyle. Tom Szaky regards Loop as a means to continue to deliver affordability and convenience at the same time as eliminating the waste. This is facilitated by the economic depreciation of reuse: expensive packaging grows cheaper the more times it is used, and Loop claims the costs are similar to SUP when collection and washing are factored in.

But what of Loop’s overall environmental footprint? While there has been considerable societal pressure in favour of reusable systems, to date the arguments have tended to be more intuitive than empirical. According to TerraCycle, Life Cycle Assessments have been carried out under usage pattern assumptions that demonstrate an opportunity to cut carbon as well as packaging waste. Results vary from product to product but, according to TerraCycle, tend to reach parity with single use packaging once they undergo three lifecycles.

The wider industry will of course be curious to scrutinise this data, and Packaging Europe believes we are in urgent need of a whole body of new research into the relative carbon footprints of reuse and recycling across the spectrum of consumption contexts, materials, geographies. LCAs are notoriously slippery entities, whose conclusions can be significantly changed with tweaks to parameters and assumptions. This grey area in our collective understanding and standards has to be better defined if we want to accurately map out the respective roles of reuse and recycling for an optimised sustainable ecosystem.

Packaging Europe reached out across the value chain for perspectives on the wider recycle vs reuse dilemma that Loop has put at the top of the agenda. Here’s what we heard:

Loop is one of a range of initiatives PepsiCo is exploring as part of a drive to reinvent our packaging. We are also looking beyond the bottle and beyond the bag for our brands. Our recent acquisition of SodaStream is part of this approach, as are our breakthrough innovations like Drinkfinity and beverage dispensers like Spire for foodservice and Aquafina water stations for colleges and universities. Packaging sustainability is a complex and multi-faceted challenge, requiring different solutions depending on the product, the market and the consumer proposition. We are exploring a number of different solutions as we work to achieve our vision for more sustainable packaging.

There is no one-size-fits all solution. Achieving a world in which plastics need never become waste will require different packaging and distribution models in different product, market and consumer contexts. We are exploring a number of different solutions.

We are now moving the Ambition 2030 Roadmap into action and one of the goals was to inspire and enable responsible consumption. There are many ways we want to do that but one of them is to drive 100 per cent of packaging towards reusable or recyclable. We’ve been doing a lot of innovation on the side of recyclability, but until now we hadn’t done so much on reusability.

Reusability is a new model and we absolutely want to explore this. Based on the consumer reaction we have had in the past twelve months where we’ve been testing it with a few households we believe there is real potential with this new way of shopping. It’s not just about reusability – it’s about our ability to invest in superior packaging. This is the key in brand building- basically the ownership is changing from consumer to manufacturer in terms of assets. It gives us great flexibility to invest in the packaging and that’s why some of the packaging we have developed uniquely for Loop has great aesthetics and functionality.

However, recyclability is also a priority for all our brands. Today about 86 per cent of our packaging is recyclable so we are well on our way to attaining our 100 per cent target. We’ve been active in R&D, for example the PureCycle initiative, which has developed a technology that restores used polypropylene to a virgin-like state.

In short, we are very active on both recycling and recyclability. We don’t leave any stone unturned.

Reuse models in packaging have existed for a very long time and there are many examples of reusable packaging systems in place, notably in the beer sector. So we do not see a rise in reuse models; on the contrary, many products in reusable packaging have switched to single-use due to the convenience and on-the-go markets. Now the announcement of the TerraCycle Loop initiative is different. It is a response to the unprecedented media and consumer attention on single-use plastics, which is driving brands and entire sectors to seek alternatives. In the meantime, these same brands and sectors are investing massively in the plastic recycling chain to increase the recyclability of the materials and the end-markets for plastic recyclates. Having said that, the TerraCycle model mixing digital technology and online shopping could certainly play a role in improving the consumer experience of using refillable or reusable packaging.

Reuse is a simple concept, but there are many different types of reuse whether the packaging is for transport, business or consumer use. For instance, wood pallets are reused for carrying goods, plastic crates are reused for carrying packed products, or glass bottles are reused for refill. Given that transport and business packaging tends to be organised within a well-defined logistical system, which makes the return of the packaging traceable and easier to control, we tend to consider that consumer reuse is the most difficult of the reusable systems to put in place. It requires an upfront investment on a packaging fleet, and a consumer incentive on the bottle to ensure it is returned and therefore optimise the investment. In terms of consumer reuse, glass bottles are the best performer and can go up to 40 rotations on the market. It can be a very efficient and sustainable solution to maintain products in a short supply chain, provided there is a consumer culture supporting reuse. But it is not always the best approach, and it depends very much on the size of the market. Beyond the local level, single-use is usually a better approach, provided the packaging material is recyclable and effectively recycled. Glass performs on both levels: it can be reused, but it is also a permanent material that is endlessly recycled in a closed loop.

LCA-based indicators (like carbon footprint) are dangerous to generalise. An LCA is generally conducted for specific situations and the conclusions are only valid in this specific context. Energy mix of the region considered, transport distance, breakage rates, number of refills, cleaning process, furnace efficiency, cullet rate, recycling allocation methodologies, packed volume, bottle weight, etc. are all critical factors that need to be specified before any conclusions can be drawn.

That being said, when trying to have all these parameters equal when comparing (which does not always makes sense), reusable glass is one of the best performers (all packaging considered) in LCA for local market.

While it’s better to recycle than to send something to landfill, there are still two resource-intensive cycles involved: initial production and subsequent recycling. A trend in some Latin American countries, for example, is to refill both glass and PET bottles. However, the industry has been widely impacted in the recent past by traceability issues linked to ink adhesion. Inks need to be strong enough for product codes to stay on from production through consumption but still come off easily upon return.",United States,2019.03

598,Is burning plastic waste a good idea?,"Plastic production is expected to double in the next 20 years, according to a report issued by the World Economic Forum. Plastic recycling rates, meanwhile, hover around 30 percent in Europe, just nine percent in the U.S., and zero or close to it in much of the developing world.

Sophisticated incinerators that burn plastic and other municipal waste can produce enough heat and steam to turn turbine blades and generate electricity for the local grid. The European Union, which restricts the landfilling of organic waste, already burns almost 42 percent of its waste; the U.S. burns 12.5 percent. According to the World Energy Council, a U.N. accredited network that represents a range of energy sources and technologies, the waste-to-energy sector is likely to witness steady growth in coming years, especially in the Asia Pacific region. China already has some 300 waste-to-energy plants operating, with another several hundred in the pipeline.

For one thing, siting waste-to-energy plants, like siting landfills, is difficult: No one wants to live near a plant that may host hundreds of trash-filled trucks a day. Usually the plants end up near low-income communities. The U.S. has seen only one new incinerator since 1997.

Waste-to-energy plants are also expensive to build and operate, so they generally charge more to tip loads of trash than landfills do. And because plants run most efficiently with steady streams of waste, their owners often need to import material from far, far away.

Large plants do generate enough electricity to supply tens of thousands of houses. But studies have shown that recycling plastic waste saves more energy—by reducing the need to extract fossil fuel and process it into new plastic—than burning it, along with other household waste, can generate.

Finally, waste-to-energy plants have the potential to emit low levels of toxic pollutants such as dioxins, acid gases, and heavy metals. Modern plants employ sophisticated scrubbers, precipitators, and filters to capture these compounds, but as the World Energy Council cautiously states, in a 2017 report, “These technologies are useful as long as the combustion plants are properly operated and emissions controlled.”

Some experts worry that countries lacking environmental laws, or strict enforcement, may try to save money on emissions controls. And then there’s incineration’s constant production of greenhouse gases. In 2016, U.S. waste incinerators released the equivalent of 12 million tons of carbon dioxide, more than half of which came from plastics.

A better way to burn?

Another way to convert waste to energy is through gasification, a process that melts plastics at very high temperatures in the near-absence of oxygen (which means toxins like dioxins and furans aren’t formed). The process generates a synthetic gas that’s used to fire turbines. But with natural gas so cheap, gasification plants aren’t competitive.

A more attractive technology right now is pyrolysis, in which plastics are shredded and melted at lower temperatures than gasification and in the presence of even less oxygen. The heat breaks plastic polymers down into smaller hydrocarbons, which can be refined to diesel fuel and even into other petrochemical products—including new plastics. (The Alliance to End Plastic Waste includes pyrolysis companies.)

Seven relatively small pyrolysis plants now operate in the U.S., some still in demonstration phase, and the technology appears to be expanding worldwide, with facilities in Europe, China, India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The American Chemistry Council estimates that the U.S. could sustain 600 pyrolysis units handling 30 tons of plastics a day, for a total of around 6.5 million tons a year—just under a fifth of the 34.5 million tons of plastic waste the country now generates.

On the other hand, critics call pyrolysis an expensive and immature technology, with startups that have come and gone over the years, unable to meet their pollution control limits, or technical and financial goals. It is still cheaper to make diesel from fossil fuel than from waste plastic.

But is it renewable?

Is fuel from plastic a renewable resource? According to the Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency, 16 U.S. states consider municipal solid waste, including the plastics in it, a renewable fuel source. But plastics aren’t renewable in the sense that wood, paper, or cotton are. Plastics don’t grow from sunlight: We make them from fossil fuels extracted from the ground, and each step in that process has the potential to pollute.

In the European Union, only the biogenic fraction of municipal solid waste is considered renewable. But no matter how the EU counts its carbon, burning plastics for fuel in incinerators, along with the rest of its waste, seems to contravene the union’s adoption, in 2015, of “circular economy” goals, which aim to keep resources in use for as long as possible and call for all plastic packaging to be reusable, recyclable, or compostable by 2030.

“When you take fossil fuels out of the ground, make plastics with them, then burn those plastics for energy, it's clear that this is not a circle—it's a line,” says Rob Opsomer of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which promotes circular economy efforts. But pyrolysis, Opsomer adds, can be considered part of the circular economy if its outputs are used as feedstock for new high-quality materials—including durable plastics.

Zero-waste advocates worry that any approach to converting plastic waste into energy does nothing to reduce demand for new plastic products and even less to mitigate climate change. “To uplift these approaches is to distract from real solutions,” says Claire Arkin, a campaigner with the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives—that is, solutions that allow people to use less plastic and reuse and recycle more.",United States,2019.03
599,The problem with plastic,"Despite our best efforts, plastic is still a blight in our world. What are we doing wrong?

Last year, 2.26 million tonnes of plastic packaging was ‘placed on the market’, according to The UK Household Plastics Collection Survey 2018 commissioned by RECycling of Used Plastics Limited (RECOUP). Around half of that (1.12 tonnes) was used by households and almost half of that (537,000 tonnes) was collected for recycling. Sixty-six per cent was exported, while the rest was recycled in the UK.

The remaining 1,215,637 tonnes was not collected for recycling, instead ending up in landfill or energy recovery end destinations. What makes plastics such a problem?

To put it into perspective: of all the plastics found in a typical kitchen, two-thirds can’t be recycled. The Society of Plastic Industries has created seven codes to differentiate between types of plastic. However, only two types can be recycled successfully: polyethylene terephthalate (PET or PETE), which is used to create water bottles and synthetic fibres, and high-density polyethylene (HDPE), used to create bottle caps and water pipes, among other things.

Even though there has been a 2.8 per cent increase in plastic collected for recycling in the UK, that doesn’t mean it’s getting any better. There is still an epic amount of unrecyclable plastic being produced.

Data from the Financial Times reveals that the US exported 30 per cent less plastic scrap in the first half of 2018 than the comparable period in 2017, with much of the material ending up in landfill instead. It can take anywhere between 30 days and 1,000 years for plastic waste to decompose, depending on the item. Most plastic leaks potential pollutants into the soil and water in the surrounding area when it rots, although the extent of this is dependent on how well the landfill site is engineered.

According to estimates from Our World in Data, 2015 saw around 55 per cent of global plastic waste discarded, 25 per cent incinerated, and 20 per cent recycled. Of the total plastic waste produced between 1950 and 2015, only 9 per cent was recycled.

Unfortunately, in many countries, plastics intended for recycling end up being rejected at local or regional waste facilities. This is commonly down to ‘contamination’ – high levels of unrecyclable items or other matter like food waste ending up in recycling streams.

Once collected, human and machine error means a lot of material falls through the recycling net. Many items, for different reasons, are either difficult or impossible to sort or isolate.

Peter Jones, principal consultant at environmental consultancy Eunomia, says “sorting isn’t perfect and some material that could have been recycled will be rejected, some will end up in the wrong stream (e.g. mixed in with cartons or card), but the percentage is small – around 4 per cent of all UK household recycling that is collected is reported as having been rejected at the sorting plant”.

Ramon Arratia, sustainability director at Ball Beverage Packaging Europe and chairman of Every Can Counts, says that even if recycled material passes through the various sorting hoops, there can still be large-scale losses in the recycling process itself: “This unsatisfactory state of affairs can be compounded by downcycling [recycling of waste where recycled material is lower quality and functionality than the original] of the materials collected.”

It’s also down to cost. Even if plastic contamination could be sorted within the facilities, it can still be cheaper to divert tonnes of plastic to landfill. Our World in Data says that the processing cost for poorly sorted or contaminated plastic is higher and can sometimes outweigh any potential profit from recycled materials.

Right now, plastic can only be recycled a limited number of times; it is difficult to recycle; each variety of plastic requires a different recycling process, and plastics are made in thousands of different formulations. There’s also the matter of what the ‘recyclable’ material is turned into. ‘Real’ recycling is maintaining the exact properties of the same material repeatedly.

While recycling is seen as the better management option when compared to landfill or incineration, it only delays disposal using the latter two methods.

Our World in Data points out that while recycling has clear environmental benefits, it’s not always the most economically favourable choice. The relative profitability between recycling and production of new plastic is strongly determined by oil prices. When oil prices are low, it can be cheaper to make raw plastics than to recycle. For example, when crude oil prices were low in 2015-16, the recycling industry struggled to compete with raw material production.

Jones says: “The economics of plastic reprocessing have been quite volatile, and several plastic sorters and reprocessors have closed when oil prices have dipped. In the absence of a guaranteed market for recycled plastic, if virgin material gets too cheap, recyclers can’t compete.

“In its new Resources & Waste Strategy, the [UK] government is proposing to help by taxing all new plastic packaging that contains less than 30 per cent recycled material, which would improve the resilience of demand.”

Current thinking favours moving to a circular economy, which Wrap UK defines as an alternative to a traditional linear economy (make, use, dispose) in which we keep resources in use for as long as possible, extract the maximum value from them while in use, then recover and regenerate products and materials at the end of each service life.

Arratia says: “Recycling will play a key part in any circular economy, and these days there’s lots of focus on recycling’s role in the move towards circularity. Unfortunately, there’s also a lot of nonsense talked about recycling and this is getting in the way of attempts to move further down the road.”

The main problem, he explains, is that the circularity debate is framed around the twin concepts of “recyclability” and “recycled content”. “Both are attractive ideas for brands because they can form the basis of positive-looking claims. For example, many companies boast ‘our product is 100 per cent recyclable’, while many others will make statements such as ‘our product is made from 50 per cent recycled content’. While these claims sound very wholesome, in fact they have less relevance to the circular economy than at first might appear.”

If a business’s products are advertised as ‘recyclable’, it might not actually mean that the materials are recyclable everywhere. They could just be recyclable at one place, or that only a part of the product is recyclable, or it can only be recycled once, rather than many times over.

Judith Blake, the Local Government Association’s environment spokeswoman, said last year: “It’s time for manufacturers to stop letting a smorgasbord of unrecyclable and damaging plastic flow into our environment. That needs to happen urgently, but the government should now consider banning low-grade plastics, particularly those for single use, to increase recycling.

“If manufacturers don’t want to get serious about producing material which can be recycled, and protecting our environment, then they should at least contribute towards the cost that local taxpayers have to pay to clear it up,” she added.

Arratia reckons that “having a product that is recyclable sounds great to the consumer, but it’s no use if no one does recycle it. Many products are so tricky to recycle that they are either not recycled at all or only a small fraction of the material in the products is recovered.”

The issues are collection and processing. “Where can a ‘100 per cent recyclable’ product be sent first for collection and then for recycling?” Arratia asks. “If there is no feasible collection system or, worse still, no demand for the product as a secondary material, then the idea that the product is recyclable quickly falls apart. Even if the product is collectable, does processing take place only in a few highly specialised plants with very limited capacity?”

Arratia believes the term ‘recyclable’ is probably the most abused phrase in the circular economy, with no guidelines on how it should be used. “It’s such a tempting claim for marketing teams because it implies such great possibilities, but realities, not possibilities, are what’s important.”

Arratia argues that a consequence of the current obsession with recyclability and recycled content is that we’ve developed a fixation on collection at the expense of trying to foster a true circular economy, and many consumers think of recycling as just placing their rubbish into separate bins and then forgetting about it.

“Communications from governments and companies tend to reinforce that convenient concept, but collection doesn’t guarantee real recycling,” Arratia notes.

For example, the Green Dot logo on packaging, which seems to indicate the product will be recycled, just means that fees are paid. When consumers separate the material and believe it’s going to be recycled, it is often incinerated or exported to Asia.

The top 10 exporters, seen as high-income countries, collectively account for 78 per cent of global plastic exports. Much of this used to go to China and Hong Kong, which went from buying 60 per cent of plastic waste exported by G7 countries during the first half of 2017, to taking less than 10 per cent a year later.

Following China’s ban on imported plastic in 2017, previous large exporters such as the United States, Canada, Australia and UK failed to handle the increase in domestic recycling demand. As a result, some materials intended for recycling have subsequently been diverted to landfill.

Nine countries including Germany, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland, have banned disposal of untreated waste in landfills and obtained a total recovery rate (recycling plus energy recovery) above 90 per cent.

A landfill, though, is not a dump, says Chris Cheeseman, professor of materials resources engineering at Imperial College London. “You hear the two terms used interchange­ably, as if a properly engineered landfill site is a waste dump,” he says. “It is not. They are poles apart.

“A waste dump is a total environmental disaster. A properly engineered landfill site is not a bad way of dealing with residual waste. For one thing, you can extract the methane which is given off, whereas in a waste dump the methane is a major global warming gas.”

However, not every country has effective facilities. Cheeseman says: “Two billion people out of the 7.5 billion on the planet do not have an adequate waste management system, but they use plastics, which are part of their daily life. Two billion people produce a lot of waste material with no way to go other than into the environment.”

In low-to-middle-income countries, levels of poorly disposed waste can be high. Our World in Data found that across many countries in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa between 80 and 90 per cent of plastic waste is inadequately disposed of, risking pollution of rivers and oceans.

How best to incentivise people to recycle? Cheeseman says that WasteAid UK, a waste management charity, could help in the plastic plight. “Waste Aid UK gives plastics value in developing countries by developing local technology so people will collect plastic, rather than dispose of it into the environment, because they see value in it. Using relatively low tech, it can produce new materials they can beneficially use and sell.” One example of this is turning plastic bags into paving tiles.

Jones concurs: “A small financial incentive has been demonstrated to make a big impact – in Norway, the deposit system means that 97 per cent of plastic bottles are recycled, while in the UK it’s only 59 per cent.

“Plastics are amazing and incredibly useful materials and it’s tragic that we use and dispose of them with so little thought. Most councils already provide services that allow a really wide range of household plastics to be recycled, and it’s up to all of us to make full use of them.”",United States,2019.03

601,Lyst Sees Significant Jumps in Sustainability Searches,"Sustainability in the world of fashion is soaring when it comes to consumer desire, according to global fashion search platform Lyst. Searches for “vegan leather” increased by 119% since October; the term “vegan fashion” was responsible for over 9.3 million social impressions, according to new Lyst research. Since 2018, Lyst saw a 66% increase in searches for sustainable fashion, which included sustainable related keywords like “ethical brands” and “Econyl.”

“Sustainable denim” saw an increase of page views of 187%, and searches for “organic cotton” increased 16% year-over-year.

This year, 80 million shoppers started their fashion search on Lyst. The company tracked more than 100 million searches to see how sustainability is affecting the fashion world and concluded that fashion is experiencing a “new wave of eco-consciousness.”

“From the most wanted green products to inspiring icons that are moving the needle, Lyst’s data reveals how the search for a more sustainable wardrobe has been pushing us to do better,” the company says.

Lyst expects that the fashion industry will begin to invest more in eco-friendly production methods, making it easier for consumers to purchase sustainable fashion. By 2020, 10% of all fashion purchases on Lyst will be made with sustainability in mind, the company predicts.

The increase in consumer interest in sustainable fashion is a happy circumstance for those in the apparel industry that are chasing the circular economy. The textile industry uses inordinate amounts of water and energy, and clothes are being disposed of at a higher rate than ever — but companies like C&A, Stella McCartney and Eileen Fisher are heightening their focus on reuse and recycling.

Resale is one aspect of a circular economy for clothing that is on the rise, particularly in the world of luxury fashion. Over the last year, traffic to luxury resale products on Lyst grew by 329%, the company says. The most wanted brands to buy pre-owned are currently Chanel, Louis Vuitton, and Gucci, followed by Hermès, Prada, Dior, Celine, and Burberry. And consumers are spending big bucks. Lyst says its luxury-brand partners agree that the average amount spent when buying second-hand luxury goods is between $500 and $1,000.

Stella McCartney was a brand founded with sustainability as the driving factor, Allison Sommer of the RealReal told Environmental Leader recently. And the commitment seems to be paying off. In September 2018, Stella McCartney released the first-ever vegetarian Stan Smith trainers in collaboration with Adidas, causing a surge in searches for the brand. In the six months following the release of the Stella x Stan Smith Faux-Leather Sneakers, searches for the brand has gone up by 21%, Lyst says.

They were the most searched sustainable sneakers on Lyst and the best selling product for the Stella McCartney brand.

According to Lyst, the most drooled-after sustainable products last year — after Stella McCartney’s kicks — came from Patagonia, Reformation Clothing, Veja, Weekday Row, AllBirds, Fjallraven, Nanushka, Mara Hoffman, Re/Done, Arket, and Eileen Fisher.",United States,2019.03
602,"UNECE, Partners Developing Traceability Tool for Garment Supply Chains | News | SDG Knowledge Hub | IISD","March 2019: The UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), the European Commission (EC), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the International Trade Centre (ITC) and private sector partners are developing a ‘Decent Work and Transparency and Traceability Tool,’ UNECE announced during the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Forum. This collaboration is part of efforts to advance sustainable production patterns and a circular economy approach, in line with SDG 12.

Momentum to address traceability and sustainability in the fashion and garment industry has been increasing, according to UNECE. In 2017, 100 major fashion brands expressed a commitment to sustainable fashion, recognizing the importance of enhancing the traceability and transparency of fashion value chains to promote more sustainable production patterns. In 2018, UNECE and ITC set up a multi-stakeholder platform to develop policy recommendations and traceability standards and contribute to SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production).

UNECE presented the traceability tool at the Due Diligence Forum, which convened from 12-14 February 2019, in Paris, France. UNECE shared an analysis on traceability from over 100 countries from around the world, which finds that only 34% of companies have traceability systems in place. In the presentation, UNECE highlighted the benefits of traceability, including building trust with consumers, developing networks among clients and suppliers and identifying opportunities for efficient and sustainable management of resources. UNECE’s analysis also finds that tracking and tracing the value chain makes sustainability claims more credible. UNECE also highlighted the development of a traceability standard and implementation guidelines as key for enhancing transparency and traceability.

UNECE and partners are building on this analysis to develop the ‘Decent Work and Transparency and Traceability Tool.’ The tool aims to help the fashion sector make risk-informed decisions and operate according to a set of internationally agreed practices. The overall aim is to guide value chains towards more responsible production and consumption patterns. The tool will feature a technical global standard for the traceability of sustainable value chains in the sector that will address the entire life-cycle of products.

The EU is providing support for the tool’s development.

607,IKEA is making a huge change by renting out furniture— and it's a prime example of the kind of thinking more companies need to be doing,"
• Businesses that adopt a circular philosophy are more likely to survive and thrive going forward, says Anne van Riel, Head of Sustainable Finance Americas at ING.
• Following a difficult 2018, IKEA has decided to reevaluate its business and shake things up.
• The company has decided to start leasing its furniture — a prime example of a company addressing disruption but also one of the most high-profile cases of the circular economy.

For so many years, IKEA has seemed unrelenting in its domination among home furnishing retailers. However, even the Swedish giant, known for such items as the Billy bookcase and Malm bed, is not immune to disruption from changing customer behaviors and demands. For IKEA, the answer may well lie in disrupting its own business.

Following a difficult 2018 which included a fall in profits and job losses, IKEA has decided to reevaluate its business. As a result, the company has announced that it is set to start leasing furniture, signaling one of the most significant shifts from its traditional model for decades. This product-as-a-service (PaaS) trial — or Sofa-as-a-Service as some are calling it — is a prime example of a company addressing disruption but also one of the most high-profile cases of the circular economy.

IKEA and the retail sector are not alone. A combination of shifting consumer behaviors and rapidly-evolving digital technologies is disrupting long-established business models across many industries and putting increasing pressure on traditional growth models.

What do cars, printers and clothing all have in common? Or perhaps the question ought to be framed as “what will they have in common?”, because it’s easy to envisage a future where consumers no longer ‘own’ any of these things but opt purely for an ‘access’ model.

If we look at the automotive industry, as one example, new vehicle sales have traditionally accounted for the lion’s share of revenues. Yet the future could look quite different.

Increased connectivity through smartphones and the Internet of Things (IoT) coupled with urbanization could lead to a surge in demand for car- and ride-sharing or e-hailing services like Zipcar or Uber. As consumers place more value in the digitally-driven services in their vehicles, product-as-a-service models may be preferred because it makes it easier for them to keep their technology current. What it means to be a car owner and manufacturer could be very different.

Similar forces are at work in other industries too. It is becoming increasingly common for businesses to access rather than own electronic devices such as printers because of the flexibility it provides them with — and to avoid falling behind as technology upgrades come along. It may not be long before personal computers follow this trend and consumers migrate to a subscription model there too.

Meanwhile, in healthcare, some providers are now placing their bets on offering managed equipment services for medical technology, to respond to demand from healthcare institutions to future-proof their assets and reduce maintenance costs.

As these product models become more dominant within certain industries, those businesses that have adopted a circular mindset should be able to make a more natural transition to deliver them.

One trait that is central to the implementation of circular practices is a high propensity to innovate. Companies that adopt a circular economy philosophy become masters of redesigning products to enable remanufacturing and repair.

They learn to embrace organizational agility too, rethinking existing processes, adapting supply chains and collaborating with a broader ecosystem of partners.

These qualities will deliver a strategic advantage as companies seize the initiative to uproot old product models and bring new ones to market.

When implementing circular frameworks, one of the first areas that companies often address is to increase their recycling levels, working toward the ultimate goal of creating a closed materials loop. Achieving this requires developing closer connections and more frequent engagement with customers, as they must play their part in enabling companies to recover materials in their products.

In turn, this may help companies to bring their customers along with them on their circular transition. It may smooth the path to service-based models and subscription models too, as customers become engrained in the process of purchase, use and return.

A more open dialogue and more frequent interactions with customers — whether business or retail — could also help in moving to new pricing models that will accompany subscription-based and sharing models. It may be necessary to work with customers during the development of new pricing and payment approaches.

The businesses that adopt a circular philosophy are likely to be more future-oriented in their strategic vision too. They will naturally recognize the potential sustainability and revenue win-win of some emerging product models.

For example, PaaS models will be high on their radar given the potential to increase product longevity, reusability and the sharing of materials. And product sharing too, which facilitates the sharing of overcapacity or underutilization, so improving the efficiency of resource use.

In fact, the businesses at the forefront of introducing these new product models — whether by intention or not — are already driving increased circularity. In many cases, these businesses are also some of the most mature within their industries on sustainable thinking.

In today’s fast-changing environment, the pace of business model disruption is only set to accelerate. And while there are many factors that will enable businesses to ensure they are on the right side of change, there are good reasons to believe that those which embrace a circular economy philosophy, such as IKEA, will have something of a head start.

Last week marked the first , an open festival for events in support of the circular economy with the aim of inspiring industry professional across sectors to go circular.

608,FKuR Position Paper: Heading for a circular economy with bioplastics,"In a new position paper, FKuR Kunststoff GmbH offers its viewpoint on the use of biobased and biodegradable plastics, and their contribution to a circular economy.

As part of the current discussions regarding the ecological sense and consequences of the use of plastics, biobased as well as biodegradable plastics are taking on an as yet unidentified special status.

As a responsible manufacturer and marketer, FKuR confirms both product groups have a great potential to meet the demands of the current EU directives in addressing this issue. The company emphasises the excellent suitability of biobased thermoplastics for conventional material recycling, while it sees biodegradable plastics as an efficient and proven solution for those applications where this property generates added value for the end product.

Carmen Michels, Managing Director of FKuR, said: ""For decades, plastics have made a significant contribution to better living conditions, more sustainable products and waste prevention with their unique combination of light weight, versatility, performance, durability and cost-effectiveness. However, in the face of their omnipresence, industry, commerce and consumers alike are challenged to use, reuse, dispose of, recycle them and ultimately properly utilise them in a responsible way. Biobased and biodegradable plastics offer attractive opportunities to meet all aspects of this requirement.“

A key element of the European Commission's Circular Economy Package published in December 2015 is the shift from a linear economic model to a circular economy. As a result, at the beginning of 2018 the Commission developed a ""EU Strategy for Plastics in the Circular Economy“. According to these plans, from 2030 all plastic packaging on the EU market will be recyclable and the consumption of disposable plastics will be reduced.

For Patrick Zimmermann, Director of Sales & Marketing at FKuR, bioplastics play a key role in the implementation of the EU directives: ""Especially with drop-in bioplastics it is possible to implement sustainable concepts in two ways, firstly the bioplastic product itself is made from renewable raw materials and secondly, it can be recycled after use via existing recycling systems.

Thus, not only are fossil resources saved but packaging, for example, can also become a valuable material for the manufacture of other products. We therefore warmly welcome the EU's request to the Member States to support the use of biobased materials in the manufacture of packaging and to improve the market conditions for such products.“

For bioplastics, both material and organic recycling can prove useful.
• The resource-saving material recycling established for conventional (petroleum-based) plastics can also be used, without any restrictions, for the biobased alternatives which are often used as direct drop-in products (such as Bio-PE or Bio-PET). Recyclates can be returned to the recycling cycle as often as possible products can be used and, in the end, will have to be ultimately used for energy recovery. Thus, biobased plastics can be used to generate renewable energy that does not produce any additional harmful CO , a closed CO cycle, which is in-line with nature’s model.
• Biodegradable plastics that comply with the standard for industrial compostability (e.g. EN 13432) can be organically recycled. This is particularly useful when plastic products are contaminated with food where material recycling would be unreasonably expensive. Simple and hygienic handling of biowaste using compostable bags for example, ensures that less valuable waste is disposed of via the residual waste bin. This gives the potential to increase the amount of biowaste collected separately, and at the same time, increases the yield of valuable compost. This can be used later as fertiliser for those crops that are at the beginning of this cycle.",United States,2019.03

610,From Waste to Resources: SWACO takes mystery out of Franklin County's landfill,"If you’re like most central Ohioans, you stop thinking about the waste you generate after you take your trash can to the curb. But that’s really where the process begins, and it takes hard work to make sure your waste is safely and properly disposed of at the Franklin County Sanitary Landfill.

The publicly owned landfill, which opened in 1984, is an engineering marvel that serves as a critical asset to Franklin County families, residents and businesses. In fact, all municipal solid waste – also known as your household trash – comes to the county landfill. SWACO owns and operates the landfill at 3851 London-Groveport Road in Grove City.

Each day, 400 to 500 truckloads of waste material are brought to the landfill. That’s more than a million tons of waste every year.

So what happens to all that waste when it reaches the landfill?

To keep up with central Ohio’s waste stream from our increasing population, the landfill is designed in “cells” – smaller segments that look like big holes in the ground, carefully constructed to keep waste materials separated from surrounding areas.

Every day, SWACO’s landfill-operations team carefully positions the material received in the landfill cell, compacts it to save valuable space and covers it.

SWACO takes many environmentally focused steps at the landfill, including the use of such materials as shredded automobile dashboards and seats to cover the waste material in order to conserve precious natural resources like soil, which traditionally has been used to cover waste.

And still, your waste’s journey isn’t complete. As material in the landfill decomposes, it produces gas composed mostly of methane and carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen and oxygen.

To further advance our sustainability efforts in the landfill, SWACO formed an innovative partnership in 2014 with Aria Energy to recycle these gases, further extracting resources from our garbage and turning them into a new product.

To do this, we rely on a collection-and-control system consisting of 280 gas-extraction wells and miles of underground piping. This system collects the landfill gas and sends what can be reused to Aria Energy to be processed into renewable resources and put back into production use.

The partnership has resulted in annual royalty payments of more than $6 million, which have been reinvested in SWACO’s waste-diversion programs and community services.

For central Ohioans, the landfill is much more than a final destination for the trash we generate each day. It’s also a valuable community resource that should be protected and used as efficiently as possible to guarantee its viability for generations to come.

SWACO holds regular educational tours of the Franklin County Sanitary Landfill to take the mystery out of the landfill and to educate residents about where waste ends up. Learn more about our landfill tours under the “Resources” tab at swaco.org.

The Franklin County Sanitary Landfill has a life expectancy of about 50 more years. But we could extend its life by keeping more material out of it in the first place. More than 70 percent of all materials that go to the landfill each year – or about $41 million worth of resources – could be recycled or reused.

That’s why SWACO emphasizes recycling and reusing our way to a cleaner community.

611,ENI and COREPLA sign agreement for plastic packaging waste,"The Italian national consortium for the collection, recycling and recovery of plastic packaging (COREPLA) has signed an agreement with energy company ENI to launch research projects into producing hydrogen from non-recyclable plastic packaging waste.

Signed by Eni, chief refining and marketing officer Giuseppe Ricci and COREPLA, president Antonello Ciotti, the agreement will see a joint working group assess the launch of research projects to produce hydrogen and high-quality biofuels from plastic waste over the next six months.

The two companies will also analyse how the market for non-mechanically recyclable packaging will evolve over the next few years and, in line with the new EU directives, will study the types of waste that can be used to develop a positive, innovative circular economy process and maximise recovery.

In sorted waste, plastic packaging is separated and sent to be recycled so it can be reused, mostly by transforming it into chips or grains which then become raw material for creating new products. The aim of the research is for Plasmix – different plastics that can’t be used in the recycling market – to now be recycled and transformed into new raw material.

The hydrogen produced by this process can be used in the production of biofuel to neutralise oxygen in vegetable oil and convert triglycerides into paraffins and isoparaffins, removing the sulphur, nitrogen and polyaromatic hydrocarbons.



This waste-to-fuel processing is central to Eni strengthening and developing its strategy to apply the principles of the circular economy to its business. The company has been producing high-quality biofuels since 2014 in Porto Marghera and Gela from cooking and frying oil, animal fat and other non-edible waste.

The results will be crucial to supporting the announced production on an industrial scale at these plants and potential other disused industrial sites in Italy and other countries.",United States,2019.03
613,Making use of all that is around you,"When the Kenyan government instituted a nation-wide ban on logging in 2017, furniture companies like Funkidz were badly hit.

The ban, which was instituted to facilitate the rehabilitation of national forests, saw the prices of timber and poles skyrocket as they became hard to source. Many companies’ revenue suffered as they had to purchase raw material from other countries. But instead of dwelling on the setback, Ciiru Waithaka, who founded the Nairobi-based children’s furniture company Funkidz, decided to find a solution. “We realized we have to innovate,” Waithaka said.

While in the company’s warehouse one day, Waithaka saw a pile of wooden pallets that had been used for a delivery and thought that if she could repurpose the wood that would otherwise go to waste, she could turn it into something usable.

“As a business you can complain about the lack or quality of raw material or you can do something about it,” she said. “I thought instead of cutting more trees, how do I harvest pallets and start using the circular economy in that.”

After some research she found more and more places from which to source pallets, and soon she was making tables and desks that were “funkier” than before.

Waithaka saw the opportunity to repurpose all types of discarded material for furniture. She visited local markets and bought bales of second-hand clothes for her soft furnishings, such as cushions.

The company understood how much water is wasted in making even one T-shirt or pair of jeans and by using second-hand, “the innovation and the funkiness has come out [in the designs] even stronger than we expected. Each piece is original,” she said.

Soon, Waithaka branched out to repurposing office furniture as well, realizing that there was potential to do social good. She approached corporate offices and asked if they would donate broken or unused furniture to Funkidz so that the company could recondition it and sell it to Kenyan schools at affordable prices.

“There is no excuse today to have children sitting on the floor in schools in Kenya,” Waithaka said. She says that in most cases communities are unaware on the potential of the waste they have sitting around to create furniture that they desperately need.

Funkidz also sells new furniture made from sustainably-sourced forests in South Africa. But in order to curb the level of human waste, Waithaka allows for parents to resell any product bought from Funkidz back to the company once a child outgrows it. “We’ve been doing that for the 10 years that we’ve been in business and yet we had no idea that was what the circular economy was about,” she says laughing.

UN Environment, the leading global voice on the world’s environment, has encouraged the use of the circular economy by reusing materials and creating value from products and services that would otherwise go to waste. It supports programmes around the world in waste management and has assessed that greenhouse gas emissions could fall by 79 to 99 per cent across industrial sectors if the circular economy was adopted large-scale.

After applying the recycle and repurpose model, Waithaka was inspired to look at other everyday waste produced in Kenya that could be reused. Her curiosity led her to rice husks: the hard, protective coating of rice.

The husks, which are abundantly found in Kenya, contain opaline silicon dioxide and lignin. When farmers burn the husks to dispose of them after milling the rice, the silicon dioxide turns into cristobalite, a mineral that is toxic to the environment and that can cause permanent lung damage in people.

“From a health perspective, it is terrible and we have mounds and mounds around the country,” said Waithaka.

The Funkidz founder decided to try and create particle boards, otherwise known as low-density fibreboard, from the husks. The fireboard could then be covered with laminate, and used as a replacement for raw materials. In line with this, Funkidz will participate in the incubation programme of NETFUND to carry out research into the potential use of such particleboards for furniture and housing.

Waithaka said that instead of complaining about environmental policies impacting business, “we're going to be even that much more responsible and come up with a solution.”

She pointed to the impact that the rice husk innovation could have in the creation of jobs for the community, and said that while this was born from a challenge they encountered in Funkidz, this innovation was not going to be limited to operations in Funkidz, as it has so many other potential applications.

The company now has six months to build a one-bedroom house using the rice husk low-density fibreboard. They will test it for termite resistance among other things, which silicon dioxide is known for.

“Ciiru Waithaka is the epitome of a woman who has taken sustainability to another and realistic level, for the benefit of her community and products that are part of a circular economy,” said Musonda Mumba, Chief of the Terrestrial Ecosystems Unit at UN Environment. ""She is the change SHE wants to see.”

Funkidz will be exhibiting approximately 25 pieces of furniture at the Sustainable Innovation Expo during the United Nations Environment Assembly to showcase their take on the circular economy.

During the United Nations Environment Assembly, from 11 to 19 March 2019, UN Environment is urging people to Think Beyond and Live Within.

615,5G Wireless: Making the Reverse Logistics Connection,"Editor’s note: Verizon sponsored this posting, asking Earth911 for a review of the sustainability impacts of 5G network technology that will be introduced to consumers and business this year. This article contains links to other websites. Earth911 is not responsible for the privacy policies of those other websites. When you click on a link, your information may be collected by those websites. Please read their privacy policies.

Sustainability is a problem of progress. As new technologies pile up, consuming resources and delivering benefits of often questionable value, we consume more resources and the Earth is taxed, sometimes to death. But technology has already reduced waste substantially and new faster wireless networks built on 5G promise to deliver greater efficiency, as well as support new approaches to recycling, logistics, circular economy business models, and the immediacy of experience shared around the globe.

5G, the next generation of wireless data network, provides speeds as high as 20-times today’s typical broadband networks. Because it is fast enough to respond to human activity in real-time, new forms of services, from remote monitoring of water use on farms to brain surgery conducted over thousands of miles, 5G represents an opportunity to rethink the organization of society to support sustainable approaches to human life.

Our challenge, as citizens, shoppers, and workers — including business owners, whose control of economic decisions has been amplified by fixed industrial technology — is to understand all the new components of technology and its social and environmental consequences. This writer has covered wireless technology since before new technologies were referred to as the Next G, or generation. 5G delivers a ubiquitous broadband network that can revolutionize the economy, bringing a circular vision of materials extracted from nature once to be reused as nutrients of future generations of products.

Here are four sustainability opportunities we see emerging with 5G technology:

It is difficult to keep in mind how much more information is available today than only 30 years ago. Humans can measure much of the world in detail, but analyzing all that data has remained a growing challenge. 5G’s 1 GBps+ bandwidth can transfer data from sensors to computer-assisted experts who will turn it into insights that can be used to improve the management of food, products, and waste.

Traditional ways of thinking about networks emphasize delivery of data rather than collection. But with the rise of the internet, people became more than recipients of broadcasts, they started sending their own information into the network. Connectivity has raised many privacy issues, but also delivered tools for improving life, preserving the environment, making better choices at the store, as well as our fitness and diets. Apps now interpret personal data to help keep us active, to track our caloric intake and burn rates. It may sound trivial, but it is what was possible with trickles of data.

5G will turn data sharing into an even greater torrent than today. With the rise of quantum computing, which will make quick work of analysis of massive amounts of information, 5G can be the link that turns data collection into action quickly. That will change our approach to anticipating demand and the relationship of customers values to business. Logistics systems such as Amazon, which currently fill our homes with boxes and wasted packaging, could become circular, with automated approaches to capturing waste and recycling or reusing it efficiently.

Back in the early days of cellular telephones, I happened to spend the afternoon with Craig McCaw, a founder of the wireless phone business. We were sitting with his executive team when McCaw pointed to the CEO and said that he did his best thinking when he was fishing; with a cell phone, he only needed to make a call to get that thinking.

But McCaw also pointed out the window at the city park below the office. “The guy cleaning the park will be able to take a call when his wife goes into labor and be with her for the birth, he said.” That vision has arrived, and more. The pace of growth in broadband capacity has changed the way people work repeatedly. Office sharing has replaced dedicated office space for many workers, and many corporations now provide remote work options for employees.

With 5G, work will be possible almost everywhere the network reaches. The technology supports up to one million connections within a kilometer, with high-speed transfer capability so that even a moving train, airplane, or drone can stay connected. All those connections represent places where humans will provide control and judgment, doing the work of our times.

All those new connections, including the ones we put in our homes, will provide new transparency in the economy, if we demand that insight into how the businesses operate. With millions of connections, including to individual packages and packaging used in consumer products, our mobile phones will have the ability to interrogate a product before buying to establish that it meets our environmental and social responsibility standards.

Imagine being able to see into the history of a product to see if it contains dangerous or unrecyclable ingredients or packaging. 5G can make that a reality, if we value transparency.

The World Bank is working to create databases and systems for establishing the provenance of a product, the basis for ecological accountability and, most importantly, transparency when deciding what to buy. 5G is essential to environmental accountability becoming a convenient and fast step in the buying process. Imagine being able to visit Amazon, Walmart, or a local shop with the ability to screen out all carbon-contributing or socially irresponsible products from your shopping list. We can manage CO2 emissions, sending feedback from customers to make clear that unsustainable products and practices will not be tolerated.

With transparency, people can take greater control of the economy.

The recycling system depends on a fixed collection process and the success of consumers in separating their recyclable materials from true waste. However, we know that many materials can be profitably recycled if the cost of collection is kept low. 5G can support smart packaging that talks back to the producer to help streamline collection.

How? For example, a blue bin or even a wastebasket can be equipped with sensors that track the weight of collected material as well as what kind of materials are in the container. With that kind of insight at the “edge of the network,” where technology has exploded since 1990, it is possible to build collection routing for recycling pickups and route each material to the specialized recyclers.

A smart infrastructure in the city and rural communities, which can be connected at high speed to the 5G network efficiently, will create new combinations of services that create economic opportunity throughout the supply chain. Indeed, individuals with specialized knowledge ranging from how to compost to repair a broken mobile phone can be connected to customers more efficiently. This is not the old claim that the internet will let a fine guitar maker sell a guitar to everyone in the world, but a chance to connect local workers to solve significant problems.

Sustainability and progress will evolve together. 5G’s ability to connect billions of sensors and devices will give humanity new insights into the complex modern problems we face. 5G on its own is a tool, but combined with human creativity it is a potential silver bullet for sustainability challenges.

What Can You Do?

We encourage readers and companies to check out Verizon’s 5G Labs, where participants can receive up to $1 million in support for 5G-based solutions to major business, environmental, and social challenges. 5G phones will start to hit the market in the first half of this year.

619,"Thinkathon studies circular economy, experience retail","Forty international experts took on tasks set by challenge hosts Bikini Berlin, Otto Group and TCBL at the recent edition of the Thinkathon in January. The event saw six multidisciplinary teams presenting sustainable business strategies and forward-looking concepts on the subjects of the circular economy, experience retail and industry 4.0 within 48 hours.The Thinkathon was held on January 14 and 15, 2019 in Berlin. It was organised by Messe Frankfurt as part of the Neonyt trade fair.The Neonyt Thinkathon is a radical design-thinking format established by Messe Frankfurt. It involves multidisciplinary teams developing future-oriented approaches for the sustainability transformation of the fashion and textile industry. The Thinkathon brings together progressive companies from the fashion and textile industry with the unique Neonyt network. Challenge hosts, each come up with a challenge on a specific subject area, which two international teams have just 48 hours to work on. The Thinkathon was organised on behalf of Messe Frankfurt by Berlin agency Sourcebook.In January, experts from the fields of fashion, textile, architecture, technology, marketing and research came from a total of 19 nations and transformed the Old Smithy’s Dizzle event location, an old barn in the heart of Berlin, into a collaborative ideas workshop for two days. Each of the challenges was tackled by two of the six small groups so all three challenge hosts, – concept shopping mall Bikini Berlin, the Otto Group and EU project TCBL (Textile and Clothing Business Labs) - were presented with two completely different solutions at the end of the Thinkathon.In Challenge #1 – The Circular Experience – the Otto Group asked how the concept of the circular economy could be made more accessible, appealing and tangible for its customers. The first Thinkathon approach had the title “Blue Loop Customer Journey”: a member scheme that rewards customers with points when they buy sustainable products. The programme also wants to promote a circular approach: a points system would encourage people to participate in repair workshops or send back worn-out pieces of clothing for recycling purposes.The second concept “Otto Circular System” includes a community platform that offers customers circular-relevant services ranging from recycling and upcycling to styling tips. And clothing that is still in good condition can be passed on or sold via a virtual swap shop. Here too, the experts recommend a points system that rewards customers for circular activities, which in turn can be redeemed for sustainable products and services.Under the title “The Future of Retail – for Good”, challenge host #2 Bikini Berlin asked: at a time when sustainability is a key factor, how can shopping centres change the whole shopping experience to involve and activate customers? “Step into Sustainability” is the first solution that was developed for Bikini Berlin. The idea: guided tours of the spacious shopping mall along a series of interactive displays and installations on the topic of sustainability.The “Bikini Fashion Clinic” is the concept of a fashion clinic that extends the lifecycle of damaged clothing by repairing it or breathes new life into second-hand pieces by recycling or upcycling. The clinic also offers family-friendly workshops and events to help improve the visitors’ creative skills and bring them together with other like-minded people.Challenge #3 “Sustainable Short Runs” and host TCBL were looking for ways to map European production capacities for sustainable nearshoring, small-batch production and short delivery times.As a response to this, one of the Thinkathon’s expert panels developed the “Short Runs Toolbox” – an easily accessible online platform with additional information, helpful services and tools like checklists or individual filter options. The toolbox should help to pave the way for small-scale production that is “Made in Europe” and to optimise the communication between interested designers and producers.The sixth team of experts developed the concept of a “Shortruns Agency”, which brings together European designers and producers, coordinates suitable partners and capacities, streamlines processes, arranges funding and helps make small-batch production more economic and feasible for everyone involved.In a video, excerpts of the workshop results were then presented on the Fashionsustain conference stage to an international audience of professionals. Like the Thinkathon, Fashionsustain is also a part of Neonyt, the global hub for fashion, sustainability and innovation, which celebrated its premiere during Berlin Fashion Week at Kraftwerk and was developed by Messe Frankfurt as a fusion of the successful tradeshow duo Greenshowroom and Ethical Fashion Show Berlin.

622,Chemical recycling to reach maturity in 5-10 years - execs,"LONDON (ICIS)--Chemicals recycling technology is continuing to mature and could become mainstream within the next five to 10 years, according to executives from BASF and INEOS Styrolution on Friday.

The process of breaking plastic waste down to its constituent molecular parts to reconstitute it as a petrochemicals feedstock is the “missing link” to close the loop on a functioning circular economy, according to Klaus Wittstock, head of industry advocacy and environmental policy at Germany’s chemicals major BASF.

Chemicals recycling solutions are at various stages of development, with some at the laboratory or pilot plant phase and others further along the cycle.

However, five to 10 years remain before the technology is fully mature, said Wittstock, speaking at the IdentiPlast conference in London.

Norbert Niessner, director of global research and development (R&D) at styrenics specialist INEOS Styrolution, also set out a five-to-10-year timeline.

Others, however, were less optimistic. Stuart Hayward-Higham, technical developments director at UK waste treatment firm Suez, was less optimistic on the overall timeline and its implications for meeting mooted EU recycling and circularity goals, many of which envisage deadlines in 2030 and through the 2030s.

“[I see] five to 10 years before we're ready to cookie-cutter the model, but then to build plants at scale through that process is going to take five to 10 years on top of that,” said Hayward-Higham.

“By my calculations, that suggests that we'll miss 2020, 2025, and might catch the back end of 2030 for some of this [technology], so the question is how we do that transition [to a circular economy in the current timeframe],” he added.

The road is longer for carbon dioxide (CO2) to polymers technology, which continues to develop but is likely 20-30 years away from becoming a mainstream technology, according to Ann Dierckx, director of sustainability at the European chemicals trade group Cefic.",United States,2019.03
623,French Company: We Can Infinitely Recycle PET Plastics Using Enzymes,"PET is a popular polyester, used to produce plastic packaging, textile fibers and almost 500 billion plastic bottles a year around the world. A French company called Carbios has announced a process it says can infinitely recycle PET plastics using enzymes, even creating clear bottles from colored, post-consumer ones.

The enzyme solution is said to be superior to current thermo-mechanical recycling processes. Those processes can't be used to recycle colored, opaque, dark or complex plastics, which instead end up in landfills or incinerators.

PET stands for polyethylene terephthalate. Current recycling processes for it only reuse PET plastics for downgraded applications like fibers, and in low proportions, to make new plastic products (around 6% for a bottled cola or water, for instance).

How does it work?

The Carbios process relies on enzymes, a biological catalyst, designed and optimized to infinitely recycle PET plastics such as bottles, packaging and PET polyester fibers, says Benjamin Audebert, the company's head of investor relations.

The company announced it has produced the first PET bottles made with 100% Purified Terephthalic Acid (rPTA) through the enzymatic biorecycling of plastic waste.

In the process, a mix of plastic waste is placed in a reactor with water and the company's enzyme, which is heated for 16 hours at 65 degrees C.

After this, a filtration and purification process enables the recovery of the building blocks that make up PET plastics, known as PTA (Purified Terephthalic Acid) and MEG (Mono Ethylene Glycol), Audebert explains.

""These are then repolymerized into virgin PET and transformed into a bottle, without the need of having to use new monomers made from fossil resources.""

The Carbios process is running at pilot scale at the company's site in France. Carbios is about to begin construction of a demonstration plant near Lyon, a large urban area in the country.

The plan is to break ground this summer, have the plant in full operation by the end of 2020 or early 2021, then license the technology to a PET or PTA producer in 2021 or 2022 for a full-scale operational plant by 2023, putting out up to 200 kilotons (200,000 tons) per year.

Competing PET recycling technologies are based on a chemical approach. The Carbios biological recycling process is said to be the first-ever to enable the full deconstruction of PET plastics and fibers into their original building blocks, or monomers.

""The building blocks can be reused to produce new plastics, promoting a circular economy principle, with no loss in quality,"" Audebert adds.

The enzyme process means single-use plastics can be removed from circulation via biorecycling, so petroleum byproducts don't need to be used to make new plastic bottles.

""A full Life Cycle Impact study on PET production using our enzymatic technology versus the traditional manufacturing of virgin plastic made from fossil fuels is about to be conducted as we are now running the process at pilot stage (2018-2020),"" Audebert explains.

""What’s to be noted at this stage is that we operate at low temperature (65 degrees C), with no pressure and without using any solvents. Energy consumption is therefore fairly low and we don’t use or generate hazardous products.

""PTA and MEG can be fully recovered from the depolymerization of PET. All additives and colors are extracted during the filtration and purification process under a solid form. At demonstration scale, part of the water (especially steam) will be reused in the process and the remaining wastewater (after purification) can be treated in conventional wastewater treatment plants.""

Who has signed on to use it?

Cosmetics giant L’Oréal has joined a consortium with Carbios to be one of the first to use the technology. Carbios is said to be recruiting other brands, and Audebert says major ones from the beverage and textile industry have expressed interest.

The partnership makes sense. Corporations that sell soft drinks and bottled water have committed to stop using single-use plastics, including Coca-Cola by 2030.

Europe and China also have made commitments to recycle a higher percentage of their plastic waste.

""Our solution is instrumental to helping meet and, in fact, exceed these goals,"" Audebert says.",United States,2019.03
624,Kent County enlists The Right Place to help develop Sustainable Business Park,"GRAND RAPIDS, MI -- Kent County waste officials have enlisted The Right Place to help bring firms and funding to its proposed business park centered around waste recovery and reuse.

The Kent County Department of Public Works announced the three-year, $180,000 agreement with the Grand Rapids-based economic development group on Thursday, March 7.

The department aims to attract businesses specializing in diverting and reusing waste to set up shop on about 250 acres of vacant land straddling the Kent-Allegan county line just south of its South Kent Landfill.

The goal is to have these businesses recycle, reuse and convert county waste that would otherwise be thrown away. The project is called the Sustainable Business Park.

The Sustainable Business Park is a critical component of the Kent County Department of Public Works’ goal to divert 90 percent of the county’s trash from landfills by 2030. Currently, only about six to eight percent of the roughly 1 billion pounds of garbage processed by the county each year is recycled.

Waste officials envision the business park filled with companies that, among others roles, process construction and demolition debris, compost organic material and convert organic waste into usable fuel.

The Right Place’s role in this process, according to the agreement, would be to aid the department in finding viable businesses and funding sources, as well as engaging with Allegan County on the project.

“The Sustainable Business Park will significantly reduce the amount of trash going into landfills and attract investment from companies that can convert waste into usable products,” Dar Baas, director of the Kent County Department of Public Works, said in a statement. “The Sustainable Business Park is part of our community’s vision for a circular economy, and our partnership with The Right Place will help attract businesses, technology developers, startups and nonprofits from across the country that align with the Sustainable Business Park’s goals.”

According to the public works department, waste processing and sorting facilities alone at the park could generate $500 million in direct private sector investments and 150 jobs.

“The Sustainable Business Park has the potential to generate investment and create jobs in West Michigan, while serving as a national model of what communities can achieve with a practical, innovative approach towards recycling and upcycling,” Birgit Klohs, president and CEO of The Right Place, said in a statement. “We look forward to partnering with Kent County Department of Public Works to bring the Sustainable Business Park to life.”

The next steps for the business park, according to Kent County Department of Public Works spokesperson Kristen Wieland, is to vet businesses that responded last year to the county’s request for information about how they would utilize the space.",United States,2019.03

626,This vending machine can help save the environment -- and save you money,"In the battle against plastic pollution, Henry Pino has devised a weapon. He calls it the Ecopod, or as he likes to describe it: A vending machine with an environmental conscience.

The Ecopod dispenses biodegradable cleaning products — laundry detergent, fabric softener, all-purpose cleaner, dishwashing gel and dish soap — into refillable containers.

Pino is hoping the refills, which he says cost about 50% less than what consumers pay for a new bottle of cleaner or detergent, will help cut down on single-use plastic bottles, which are polluting oceans and piling up in landfills.

In the United States alone, 9.5 billion pounds of plastic bottles were discarded in 2017, and only 30% of those bottles were recycled, according to The Association of Plastic Recyclers and the American Chemistry Council. While the vast majority are beverage bottles, there was still 1.8 billion pounds of plastic containers for products like detergent, cleaning products and shampoos.

""I've always been in love with the beautiful marine environment that surrounds my home city of Miami,"" said Pino, 55. ""With the circular economy [model], our goal is to help facilitate a more sustainable retail model that protects the health of our planet.""

Susan Collins, president of California-based nonprofit Container Recycling Institute, thinks Ecopod has potential. ""I already refill my shampoo bottle at my local convenience store,"" she said.

The idea has been gaining momentum among big consumer products makers as well.

More than two decades ago, Pino owned another detergent company called Environmental Control Group. That business, which he launched in 1993, produced commercial strength detergent and supplied it to hotels, hospitals, dormitories, restaurants and area jails.

""We had a fleet of trucks, similar to a fuel truck and we would pump and refill the detergent into our clients' laundry machines,"" he said.

The Miami-based business grew quickly, adding more than 1,000 clients. In 2001, Pino decided to sell the company for about $800,000 and go into real estate instead.

But when the recession hit, his real estate business suffered.

""I couldn't get loans. So I thought about what else I could do,"" he said. ""I knew how to make detergent.""

But with this business, Pino decided to focus on the environment.

""This time, I was more aware of the impact of plastic pollution and the environmental consequences of synthetic ingredients,"" said Pino. ""I wanted to do my part to shift the industry to refill using eco-friendly ingredients.""

In 2010, Pino launched Environmental Solutions Group to create the Ecopod and the biodegradable detergent and cleaning products that would be sold through the machine. He backed the venture with $1.2 million of his own money and hired engineers to design a scaled down detergent production system similar to the one he used at his old business.

""I condensed it into a small machine built to service the domestic market,"" he said.

It took him about two years to create a prototype. He filed for a patent in 2015 and was granted one a year later. Production began in September 2017.

Not just about generating income

Pino started installing the machines, which cost about $4,000 each to make, about 10 months ago.

So far, Ecopods are available in five Miami apartment buildings that Pino has had a hand in developing, and at the Dadeland North Shopping Center. In January, the company opened its first retail location, where people can buy an Ecopod starter kit for $20 and get refills.

Currently, the company loans the vending machines out to its clients for free. The businesses then receive a percentage of the profits from the refills.

Tenants in apartment buildings where the Ecopod is installed get a free starter kit that includes a one-gallon container of laundry detergent and three 32-ounce containers of dishwashing liquid, degreaser and all-purpose cleaner. Refills cost $5 for 64-ounces, or $3 for 32-ounces.

Maurice Bared, CEO and owner of a chain of Miami-based convenience stores called Farm Stores, agreed to install 10 Ecopod vending machines in his stores later this month.

""Each of our stores are tiny drive-thru concepts of about 645 square feet,"" said Bared. ""Detergent bottles take up a lot of shelf space. With Ecopod, we eliminate that issue because we can place the machine either outside or at our entrance.""

He thinks budget-conscious shoppers will gravitate toward Ecopod's lower prices. If customers like it, Bared is open to adding more machines as Farm Stores looks to expand to locations in the Northeast.

Pino said he's also in talks to partner with a large Fortune 500 consumer products company. He declined to disclose the name, however, citing a confidentiality agreement.

""For me, this isn't about generating an income,"" said Pino. ""I want to grow Ecopod faster because of my love for marine life and my concern for the environment that we were leaving for our children.""",United States,2019.03

631,"Circular Economy, Storytelling, Consumption Habits Key to Fashion Green Ethos","MILAN — Sustainability has been a trending topic for fashion companies overall and it’s now ready to move toward new frontiers, which include the circular economy, aggressive communication strategies and cooperation to hit consumption habits.

These were the main takeaways at the “Rethinking Fashion Sustainability” event, held here Thursday, which discussed the next phase of the industry’s green journey. The event was organized by American management consultancy firm Fashion Technology Accelerator in partnership with Class Eco Hub, a Milan-based smart material innovation, education, marketing and communication consultancy platform.

Giusy Bettoni, chief executive officer of Class Eco Hub, noted fashion heavyweights should embrace “a three-dimensional approach [to sustainability], merging the design, innovation and responsibility pillars, as consumers want those three things at the same time, within a unique selling proposition.” Bettoni remarked the responsible ethos should be channeled in the company’s values, product development, as well as in what she dubbed as “new values,” such as transparency, traceability, animal welfare and material health.

“Longevity and durability is at the core of our brand proposition,” noted The North Face’s sustainability manager Julian Lings, pointing for example to the VF Corp.-owned brand “Renewed” project launched in July in the U.S. aimed at extending the life span of a product. “Our consumer wants us to have a stance, to have an opinion and we’re stepping up on climate change and protection of public land,” Lings explained, noting a $60 beanie crafted from wool marketed “climate beneficial” was “the third fastest-selling item on our e-commerce.”

Putting efforts into materials research and development is key to move the companies past the recycling economy and toward a fully circular one. “OVS employs a lot of cotton, it’s a circular fiber by nature but that doesn’t mean it’s necessarily sustainable,” noted Simone Colombo, head of corporate sustainability at retailer OVS. Starting from the fall 2019 collection, the company’s “polar fleece” will also employ recycled polyester only.

Colombo suggested that keeping a broader picture in mind is always pivotal to successful eco-friendly initiatives. “We are living in a spaceship, in a closed environment and every time we forget about that, we’re missing the opportunity to understand what the sustainable principles we should channel in our business practices are.”

Lings also underscored that “from a supply-chain side, the area where we should impact more is consumption,” he said, noting some 100 billion garments are produced each year globally. Zalando’s team lead sustainability and corporate social responsibility Dennis Hoenig-Ohnsorg agreed, pointing to data that show the consumption of garments will grow by 65 percent each year until 2030.

Although fashion players and garment makers’ efforts have already set the foundations for a greener industry over the past 10 years, Bettoni underscored that “only 34 percent of Millennials actually buy sustainable products because brands are not offering items designed with the lifestyle of customers [in mind] and their communication does not provide reliable information about sustainability.”

To this end, Zalando’s Hoenig-Ohnsorg stressed that in order to engage consumers to face the issue, fashion companies should embrace a storytelling approach. “Data need to be accurate and analyzed to generate information, but when you have so much [information] it’s difficult not to overwhelm the customers with an overload of it,” he said, noting “transparency is the base for the next step of green economy.”

“Sustainability is not just about products, if we don’t tell a story consumers are not going to understand: today [the green economy] is about storytelling combined with story-making,” Bettoni concurred.

As an independent company still run by its founders, Mathilde Cathiard-Thomas and her husband Bertrand Thomas, French beauty label Caudalie is also aware of and banking on the importance of storytelling as a tool to engage customers toward the topic. Giovanni Veronesi, Italy’s country manager of the brand, pointed to a green initiative called “1% for the Planet,” with which the beauty brand pledges to donate 1 percent of its global sales to nongovernmental organizations that work to protect the environment. As part of the initiative, eight million trees will be planted around the world by 2021, which will result in the company becoming “carbon negative,” meaning its carbon dioxide emissions will be more than counterbalanced.

Also key to the industry’s shift toward more environmental responsible actions is cooperation. “So many companies believe that sustainability is about giving back [to the planet], but in fact it’s important to be sustainable from the very beginning of the supply chain,” Hoenig-Ohnsorg explained, and invited his peers to embrace the green economy by “doing their bit” and according to a “you don’t need to change the world” mind-set. Zalando — which Hoenig-Ohnsorg remarked is not only a fashion-tech company, but also has logistics infrastructures — has been involved with its Zimpact program, which offers visibility, funding and expertise to industry start-ups that use digital technology to increase supply-chain transparency.

As part of the event, a group of university students also conceived and presented a manifesto called “Circularity Ideathon,” which highlights the notions Millennials consider key to develop a circular business model delivering appealing fashion. The project, spearheaded by Milano Fashion Institute teacher and sustainable fashion expert Francesca Romana Rinaldi, was supported by OVS and included students from Milan’s Politecnico, Bocconi and Cattolica universities, as well as from Milano Fashion Institute.",United States,2019.03
632,How cleaning your closets can change your company’s culture | Greenbiz,"For the past few weeks, I’ve been transitioning our children’s playroom to a room for teens. Our family challenge was to try and do it without buying anything new and coming out economically even, spending no more than we were able to generate by selling things in it. The result is that I’ve been a very active user of some tools of the circular economy: namely Freecycle.org, Goodwill, Craigslist and for the first time, Facebook Marketplace.

If you aren’t familiar with the term circular economy, it’s an economic system that designs out waste and pollution at the start, keeps materials and products in use and regenerates natural resources. It stands in stark contrast to the traditional industrial model of ""take, make, dispose."" Anytime you avoid disposing something that could be re-used or repaired, you are participating in one component of the circular economy.

I’ve become a big fan of Facebook Marketplace because it’s so much easier and often more fun to connect and communicate with the buyer before — and after. Our much-loved Melissa and Doug grocery store is delighting kindergarteners at a charter school. A broken storage cabinet went to a Brazilian carpenter, who proudly sent a photo of the cabinet totally refurbished and beautiful.

As a leader, you will want your team to understand the key concept of circularity. Seeing what we no longer need really benefit someone else feels good, which provides motivation to find more to pass on. Buying previously owned versus new feels both economically and environmentally just smarter and better.

As a leader, you will want your team to understand the key concept of circularity. Companies that employ circular-thinking will be more innovative, more efficient and more resilient in the future.

But how do you create a culture of circularity? In our work at WeSpire, we know that active participation is one of the best ways to understand a new concept. So here are three ideas to bring the ""reuse and repair"" part of circularity to life.
• Set up a simple way for employees to swap work and personal items. We heard a powerful story from a customer who fled an abusive relationship and was able to furnish her entire apartment from an employee swap room.
• Conduct a Dumpster Dive to see what items in your waste stream could be reused, repaired or recycled. Burt’s Bees saved $25,000 a year after doing one such event.
• If you sell or produce physical products, conduct in-home customer observation sessions to figure out better ways to reuse, repair, compost or recycle your packaging and product. Consider using Yerdle to set up a re-commerce initiative. Check out the new Loop circular delivery initiative, an in-home refill service for some of people’s favorite brands and products including shampoo, orange juice and ice cream.

These activities are simple but powerful ways to start to think in a circular way, which if you don’t, your customer may begin to force. At last count, 41,000 people have signed a petition asking Colgate to remove boxes from toothpaste.

But my primary suggestion is to participate yourself. Find something that you might have sitting in a closet that someone else could use. Instead of buying new, take a quick look on FB Marketplace to see if what you need is available refurbished or previously owned. You may find that thinking in a circular way makes you healthier, wealthier and wiser.

If nothing else, your closets will be just a little cleaner.",United States,2019.03
633,Shippers No Longer Reactive When it Comes to Reverse Logistics,"Long overlooked by most global logistics and supply chain professionals, reverse logistics has emerged as a premium differentiator thanks to surging e-commerce demands. Furthermore, industry analysts maintain that shippers that fail to protect their brands with a circular strategy do so at their peril.

According to leading logistics real estate firms, e-commerce and returns pressures have been reshaping the global supply chain landscape in recent years. Location notwithstanding, shippers now must find the right amount of space at the right time to secure a sweet spot in the circular economy.

“Returns are an important part of the e-commerce ecosystem and are one reason why e-commerce generates three times the real estate demand vs. brick-and-mortar retailers,” says Melinda McLaughlin, vice president of research at Prologis, the world’s largest player in the logistics real estate arena. “In turn, this reality has contributed to very strong demand during this cycle, pushing vacancy to an all-time low and boosting competitive pricing power.”

McLaughlin says that logistics real estate rent growth remained considerable in 2018, with rents rising 6% globally. Consistent with the past several years, the United States outperformed, with 8% growth. Significantly, data contained in the firm’s “4th Annual Logistics Rent Index” shows that pricing is historically strong, with low vacancies translating to higher rental rates as shippers compete for available space.

These findings were mirrored in a similar report issued by the industrial real estate firm CBRE, which noted that warehouses have experienced exponential growth over the past seven years. “As part of this e-commerce push, reverse logistics is taking up to 700 million square feet nationally,” says Spencer Levy, CBRE’s chairman of research and senior economic advisor.

According to Walter Kemmsies, managing director, economist and chief strategist of JLL’s Port, Airport and Global Infrastructure group, e-commerce and logistics companies will continue to drive industrial real estate leasing as last-mile delivery become increasingly critical. “Keen operators will view total occupancy costs as encompassing not just rents, but also the cost of inventory, transportation and labor for last-mile deliveries,” he says.

Savvy occupiers, Kemmsies adds, will understand how the bricks and clicks fit together and will use data and analytics to determine whether and where they need physical storefronts versus fulfillment and distribution centers to handle the complete order fulfillment cycle. “They’ll begin to bring logistics managers into the real estate conversation in order to establish a holistic view of their supply chains.”

XPO was among the key sponsors of the recently concluded Reverse Logistics Association (RLA) conference in Las Vegas where shippers heard from a variety of industry experts on how to monetize returned products through resale, recycling or disposal. A big focus this year was on how leading third-party logistics (3PLs) providers continue to move into reverse logistics as they attempt to keep stride with e-commerce incursion in the nation’s warehouse arena.

Erik Caldwell, XPO Logistics’ chief operating officer of supply chain in the Americas and Asia, notes that while in-store shoppers return about 8% of purchased goods, online shoppers send back nearly 30%. A recent consumer e-commerce behavior survey taken by XPO and conducted by independent research firm Goodmind also found that 86% of U.S. consumers believe an e-tailer’s return policy is among the most important considerations when deciding where to shop.

“The survey confirmed what we had suspected all along,” says Caldwell. “By using predictive analytics to forecast future returns and control costs, we can also protect brand integrity.”

Several academics were also calling for more productive relationships between shippers and 3PLs. “E-commerce companies and omni-channel retailers are increasingly outsourcing reverse logistics as a way to build brand loyalty,” says Kate Vitasek, a graduate and executive education faculty member at the University of Tennessee and author of several books on collaborative relationships.

In her RLA keynote presentation, Vitasek outlined why shippers should be “vested” with third parties to manage a seamless consumer experience, forecast future returns and control costs. “While we have seen shippers collaborate more closely in areas such as real estate and facilities management in the past, we’re now seeing more collaboration take place in the supply chain with 3PLs,” she says. “This is a natural progression, and one which should gain more traction as shippers realize that they must outsource beyond their core competencies to stay competitive in the reverse logistics marketplace.”

In a case study format, Vitasek explained how one huge U.S. multinational fine-tuned their reverse logistics operations by becoming vested with leading 3PLs. FedEx Supply Chain and its relationship with Dell is one compelling example of how these relationships come together. “As customary in the fast-paced high-tech industry, Dell operated under a procurement strategy of ‘every dollar, every year,’ meaning that it used frequent competitive bidding processes to drive down prices. By 2011, the honeymoon was over in the relationship,” she says.

The Reverse Logistics Association (RLA) titled this year’s annual conference “Cornerstone of the Circular Economy,” noting that a circular economy is an economic system aimed at minimizing waste and making the most of resources. This regenerative approach is in contrast to the traditional linear economy, which has a “take, make, dispose” model of production. And reverse logistics is gaining currency in financial settlement markets, too. One significant example of this was demonstrated when Accenture began collaborating with Mastercard, Amazon Web Services, Everledger and Mercy Corps in their launch of “the circular supply chain capability” last month. According to spokesmen, this blockchain-based solution is designed to improve supply chain transparency by empowering consumers to directly reward sustainable practices of small-scale growers and suppliers. “Our identity capabilities are already empowering millions of users around the globe to access essential services like healthcare, banking and travel,” says David Treat, a managing director and global blockchain lead at Accenture. “Our circular supply chain concept combines these capabilities with blockchain and expands its application to places and things which is allowing us to rethink global supply chains. Through effective public and private partnerships, we can place sustainability and customer empowerment at the heart of global business models.” Digital identity is a critical enabler of the offering. Through each producer’s unique digital identifier, data about the “first mile” of their goods is established and linked to their products as they move through the supply chain. End consumers, through a simple scan of a label, can access details of the product and can be empowered to direct a secure “tip” to that producer.

At that time, Dell was driving for lowest cost, but FedEx Supply Chain believed Dell’s short-term thinking was putting capabilities at risk. A major tension point was that Dell wanted FedEx Supply Chain to drive proactive innovations and assume the cost of investments. FedEx resisted because it had no guarantee of return on investment within the existing contract structure and constantly faced hard-driving cost reductions.

“It was clear that neither party was content with the current contract,” says Vitasek. “The existing contract structure and relationship dynamics placed a wedge in the trust level between the two companies, and they realized a better way was needed.”

After many internal discussions, and later talks with FedEx Supply Chain, the parties decided that the relationship was a good testing ground to try for the vested model—a methodology that works to attain win-win outcomes for both parties based on agreed upon goals and objectives.

Dell and FedEx Supply Chain have since been successfully operating under a vested model since 2012 when their new agreement took effect. Fast-forward six years, as the parties went through a refresh to update their agreement to address lessons learned and changing business environment.

Vitasek allows that many thought vesting would be a fad, or that the results would not be sustainable. But because the model is anchored in a flexible contracting framework, it can allow the parties to continually align their interests. “The relationship has successfully navigated both Dell and FedEx Supply Chain through not only transforming how they work, but navigating the changes needed to drive transformation in their reverse logistics operations,” she says.

Finally, it appears that online retailers are coming to terms with the high return volume that comes with online shopping, while reducing the cost associated with those returns remains a top priority.

Tony Sciarrotta, executive director of the RLA, says that the compression in the warehouse and industrial real estate sectors reflects the ongoing demands created by e-commerce. “And this trend will only become more intense,” he says. “That’s why it’s so vital for shippers to collaborate with a variety of third parties in the circular economy.” According to Sciarrotta, a new challenge has been set in the reverse logistics space as retailers come up to speed to match the strides already made by manufacturers.

Based on the present growth rate for returns, by 2027 customers will return nearly $1 trillion in merchandise annually, with much of it going back to stores and distribution centers operated by retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers. At the current rate of returns, RLA economists estimate that e-commerce returns will be twice the $336 billion in brick-and-mortar returns, representing $634 billion by 2023.

Currently, nearly half of all returns cannot be resold at their full retail price. As a consequence, the original seller loses margin on the additional transportation and handling costs associated with getting merchandise back while also losing more margin on the resale.

“But it’s especially gratifying to see that even Amazon and E-Bay have seized control of their destinies by satisfying consumer demand in the entire cycle,” adds Sciarrotta. “There’s no one silver bullet solution for logistics managers today, but that’s a good thing, too. It means they have more options than ever.” •",United States,2019.03
635,"Global, industry action needed to push plastics recyclability: EC official | S&P Global Platts","London — The European Commission's push to promote the recyclability of plastics in Europe will need to entail global action, voluntary commitments by industry and crucial investments, the EC's director general for environment said Thursday.

Speaking at the Identiplast conference in London, Daniel Calleja Crespo said Europe could not tackle the problem of global plastic pollution alone.

As such, the EC launched a circular economy agreement with China. The agreement foresees joint Sino-European cooperation in the area of plastics recycling and allows European participants to engage with Chinese stakeholders and discuss the issue of common standards for plastics waste and recycling in the future.

Voluntary pledges by industry participants continue to be part of reaching the EC's goals. So far, Calleja said, 60 pledges have been received by the EC, including a voluntary commitment from PlasticsEurope, a trade association for manufacturers, to eliminate plastics entering landfills by 2025.

If all of the pledges are adhered to, 11 million mt of recycled plastic could be supplied to the market by 2025, Calleja said. However, Calleja stressed the need for industry players to promote demand for recycled plastics as it would only account for 6.5 million mt as of now.

The EC will also provide additional investments as part of Horizon 2020 for the plastics sector.

Calleja said Eur100 million will be invested by 2020 to provide resources for researching and implementing innovative recycling technologies such as chemical recycling and refine mechanical recycling technologies.

In December 2015, the EC unveiled a strategy that included 54 measures to deal with eco-design, waste management and recycling amongst other things to move from a linear economic model composed of production, consumption and disposal, to a more efficient closed and circular economic model for the European plastics industry.

The strategy foresees that by 2030 all plastic packaging in the market should be reusable or recyclable, and that polyethylene terephthalate bottles and beverage bottles contain 25% and 30% of recycled plastic by 2025, respectively.

This vision would enable companies to reduce their raw material costs, with a total of Eur600 million expected to be saved at the continent-wide level, Calleja said.

""If we are able to recycle more, we develop more economic opportunities,"" he said.

However, there still remains a long way to go to reach the EU's zero plastic waste goal.

""Less than 30% of plastic waste is collected for recycling. Landfilling and incineration rates of plastic waste remain high, at 31% and 39%, respectively. We use plastic products for far too short a time compared to the investment made to produce them,"" Calleja said Thursday.

The push for recyclability will continue as the EC promotes environmentally sustainable policies.

""It takes five seconds to produce a plastic bag, five minutes to use it, five centuries to get it absorbed by the environment. We need to change this,"" Calleja said.",United States,2019.03
636,25 badass women shaking up the corporate climate movement | Greenbiz,"Search for a definition of the term ""badass"" in your go-to online resource, and those are a few of the adjectives that bubble to the surface. ""For me, badass is determined, a little bit feisty — but not too much — but tenacious,"" said Sally Uren, CEO of Forum for the Future, a nonprofit focused on inspiring the business model and systemic change need to accelerate the clean economy.

""That's one thing I've really learned is that you've just got to keep going, and don't listen when people say, 'That's a really bad idea and it will never work.' To that, I say, 'Noted.' And then I'll go figure out how to do it anyway.""

While corporate sustainability is one of those rare fields in which many women have risen to high-profile positions in the C-suite, in honor of International Women's Day, we thought it appropriate to recognize those who — like Uren herself — have been especially persistent in summoning their badass superpowers to muster corporate action against climate change.

Whether it's the unwavering diplomacy of public-sector leaders such as Christiana Figueres or the steely resolve of executives such as Apple's Lisa Jackson, this group is especially noteworthy both because of what they already have achieved and for their ability to directly influence future innovation and progress.

Every list is subjective, of course. I'm especially gratified — and somewhat chagrined — to note that we could have very easily included at least 10 more individuals at the intersection of technology-infused, systemic business model change, women such as circular economy guru Ellen MacArthur or Google Sustainability Officer Kate Brandt (both of whom appeared on our 2018 VERGE Vanguard list).

Before we get to the list, a special mention for a badass-woman-in-waiting, 16-year-old Greta Thunberg. With a simple gesture — the decision to skip school (#FridaysForFuture) to draw attention to the catastrophic impacts of climate change — Thunberg has raised awareness among her generation in a way no adult could have managed. In early 2019, she was invited to speak at the Davos gathering of the World Economic Forum, where she scolded world leaders for not being bold enough in addressing the climate crisis.

""In five years, I hope I don’t work on the climate because that would mean that everything is OK,"" Thunberg told Rolling Stone for its March ""Women Shaping the Future"" issue. ""But I probably will, and many other people will because of where we are at. We see the consequences of it today, and we will see it more clearly then.""

Without further ado, here are 25 badass women at the center of the corporate climate movement, all of whom make very convincing role models for any generation.

Previously sustainability chief for WhiteWave Foods, Bratter moved into a similar position for Danone NA when her former company merged with the U.S. operations of French food giant Danone.

In April, her team completed the B Corp certification task for Danone — turning the organization into the world's largest B Corp, a designation it still holds. Not only did Bratter assemble the right stakeholders to get the job done, they completed the process two years ahead of time. Next up: using the structure as a framework for innovation. ""B Corp doesn’t just give you a certification — it gives you a benchmark to understand where you are, what your strengths are, what your opportunities are and what best practices potentially look like,"" Bratter told me in late 2018.

Boasting deep public-sector experience, including a stint as domestic policy adviser to Vice President Al Gore, Choi spent her early career in business journalism as a foreign correspondent and bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal.

As Morgan Stanley's first CSO, Choi is responsible for promoting the idea of global sustainability through capital markets. ""We believe that a truly sustainable business is financially, as well as environmentally and socially, sustainable,"" Choi notes in an interview on her firm's website. ""Once you understand that, you begin to see that sustainability is not something that exists apart from — or in opposition to — business. Rather, it is an integral part of sound business.""

The accountant-turned-humanitarian stepped up to lead the influential NGO in March 2017. Her mission: Help companies make the business case to focus on climate mitigation and other environmental issues. The Climate Group's work centers primarily on three signature programs: the RE100 (representing companies committed to transitioning entirely to renewable electricity); the EV100 (representing businesses committed to electric transportation by 2030); and EP100 (promoting the concept of energy productivity).

Clarkson is passionate about getting businesses to talk up solutions and successes. ""The urgent task at hand is speeding up the process — making the changes needed for a zero-carbon future and pumping them with the adrenaline to match the urgency required,"" she wrote in January. You can count on her team to keep turning up the heat.



As executive secretary of the United National Framework Convention on Climate Change from 2010 to 2016, Figueres was instrumental in leading the negotiations that ultimately led to the unanimous acceptance of the Paris Agreement in 2015.

She's still at the center of the movement with Mission 2020, a self-described ""extended network"" of diplomats, strategists and campaigners. The short-term objective is to drive certain breakthroughs in energy, transportation, infrastructure, land use, industry and finance by next year. The long-term objective is net-zero emissions by 2050. In her timespan, she's been involved with everything from artificial intelligence ethics to a board seat on Spanish infrastructure company Acciona.

""Now that we know the difference between 1.5 degrees and 2 degrees Celsius of warming — including twice as much physical damage, twice as many people subjected to life-threatening heat waves and fires — we have one clear path to follow,"" Figueres wrote for Time in January. ""We must focus every effort on striving for 1.5 degrees.""

After a career spent overseeing economic studies for think tanks (Paulson Institute), supporting academic research (Columbia University and Duke University) and nonprofit organizations (Center for American Progress), the environmental design and city planning specialist became director of California Gov. Gavin Newsom's Office of Planning and Research in January.

I tend to gravitate toward the hard issues: speaking to audiences not already convinced of the centrality of climate change to economic prosperity. Her mandate is daunting: working at the ""intersection of housing affordability, access to transportation and climate resilience,"" all imperative for the state's future growth.

""I tend to gravitate toward the hard issues: speaking to audiences not already convinced of the centrality of climate change to economic prosperity or in states or regions that have not been at the forefront of environmental or clean energy action,"" Gordon said in an interview for a University of California-Berkeley alumni publication. ""I think that the ability to really listen to who is in the room and find pathways forward to achieve common goals will be really useful in my new role.""

Heiny spent eight years at retailer Target, including almost one year as director, before leaping over to Dutch apparel maker C&A in 2015. There, she works alongside CSO Jeff Hogue to innovate on many fronts.

For instance, last summer, C&A was the first company to earn Cradle to Cradle certification for jeans made out of sustainable, nontoxic materials that can be recirculated or composted at the end of their life. One year prior to that, C&A was first to market with a Cradle to Cradle T-shirt. C&A also had a front row seat in the creation of the Fashion for Good, an innovation platform for new models of production and reuse in the fashion industry.

A long-time supporter of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, where she is the chair, Heiny advocates the need for rivals to work together to catalyze change. ""Figure out where your passion lies, seek to understand what sustainability means in that context, and then go from there,"" she told GreenBiz in 2013. ""What's exciting is that there are no limits to sustainability.""

The former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator has elevated renewable energy, supplier responsibility and water conservation to the technology giant's boardroom; she reports directly to Apple CEO Tim Cook.

From fighting deforestation to using robots to recover electronics components to procuring clean power, under Jackson's watch, Apple is using its influence to shape unprecedented programs. Last year, for example, it pledged $300 million to help key suppliers negotiate solar and wind contracts in places such as China where this has been difficult to pull off — the goal is to help Apple's supply chain procure at least 4 gigawatts of renewable energy by the end of next year.

Indeed, for all Apple does on its own, perhaps its leadership on supply chain issues — and its unprecedented transparency about what's working and what's not — matters most. Over the past three years, its partners in creating iPhones, Macintosh computers, Apple Watch, AirPods, iPads and more have diverted at least 1 million tons of garbage from landfills, according to the company's 2019 supplier responsibility report published this week. It saved at least 7.6 billion gallons of water in 2018 alone.

Prior to assuming her United Nations post in 2015, Kingo led corporate sustainability strategy as part of the executive management team at pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk. In her current role, Kingo has been instrumental in helping multinationals understand the inextricable link between human rights issues and sustainable supply chains.

So far, more than 13,500 organizations have become signatories to the compact, which advocates universal principals on labor, environment and anti-corruption, among other issues. Technically speaking, that means she heads the largest corporate sustainability initiative in the world.

There are many examples of where the private sector is already taking inspiring action on climate change, but achieving a just climate transition also requires respect for the rights of people. ""There are many examples of where the private sector is already taking inspiring action on climate change, but achieving a just climate transition also requires respect for the rights of people, such as communities facing energy insecurity and local communities displaced by renewable energy projects,"" she wrote for GreenBiz in December. ""Actively integrating these types of interconnected considerations into corporate decision-making and strategy will be foundational to the long-term health of this planet — ultimately good for both society and business.""

The physicist who heads France's largest power and energy company is using three divining rods to guide Engie's future: ""decarbonization, digitization and decentralization."" And like other utility executives, she's steering through a rough transition as the sector reduces its reliance on fossil fuels for electricity generation — the company will exit 20 countries over the next three years.

Still, during 2018, Engie added 1.1 gigawatts of solar and wind generation capacity, with nine more GW to come by 2021. It has introduced the largest hydrogen-powered utility fleet in France, was the first to offer an alternative multi-fuel station and has invested in a green electric mobility service across Europe.

Under Kocher's direction, Engie also has emerged as one of the largest corporate issuers of green bonds, with $8.12 billion since 2014. ""Engie's customers seek to design and execute their zero carbon transitions with increasing urgency,"" Kocher said in a February investor presentation. ""It is core to their strategic goals, but often not core to their operational capabilities.""

Raised in the Philippines and formally trained in environmental change and management at the University of Oxford, Lao influenced the strategy of several companies in Hong Kong, including airline Cathay Pacific, before assuming her current role in 2016.

Lao was recognized in 2018 with a ""Women of the Decade"" award from the Women's Economic Forum. She is spearheading the hospitality company's plan to stop using single-use plastics by 2020. Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels owns properties in Asia, Europe and the United States, including the Peninsula Hotels portfolio.

In the past five years, Elemental Excelerator has awarded more than $30 million in funding to 82 portfolio companies that are accelerating the transition to clean energy, water, zero-emissions transportation and regenerative agriculture, and so on. Those startups have gone on to raise at $350 million more.

Examples include microgrid player Go Electric, plastics recycling concern BIoCellection and carbon removal firm Opus 12 — all co-founded by women. Indeed, 26 percent of the companies in the Hawaiian organization's latest cohort boast female founders, much higher than what's typically supported by your average technology venture firm or innovation accelerator.

Living in the world as it is isn’t an argument against working towards a better future. Lippert, a former Booz Allen Hamilton management consultant, said diversity and inclusivity — of gender, ethnicity, region and other factors — is a core consideration in Elemental's ongoing startup selection. ""What we see is that leaders come in all stripes. They have different strengths. What is notable is that you bring your own life and world perspective to what you do.""

Lippert is also director of innovation and community for Emerson Collective, the investment organization led by Laurene Powell Jobs, and she's deeply involved in the state of Hawaii's quest to transition entirely to renewable energy by 2045.

McKinney-James has been shaking up the clean energy movement for more than two decades. As a lobbyist, she helped craft her home state of Nevada's first renewable portfolio standard in 1997 — it's still one of the nation's largest solar states.

A former commissioner with the Nevada Public Utility Commission, McKinney-James later served on the transition team for President Barack Obama, with a focus on the U.S. Department of Energy and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Another milestone: She is the first African-American to win a statewide primary in Nevada.

The tireless advocate for energy equity and the role of clean energy in job creation currently lends her expertise to many organizations shaping renewables policy, including the Energy Foundation and the Alliance to Save Energy. She's also a director for MGM Resorts, where she shaped the hospitality company's renewable energy strategy alongside fellow badass Cindy Ortega.

Managing corporate environmental, social and governance issues for one of the world's largest consumer paper products companies — not to mention aligning those plans with human health and safety priorities — is a daunting mandate.

The organization behind brands such as Huggies, Kleenex and Kotex is at the midway point of its Sustainability 2022 strategy, informed in part by Morden's groundbreaking relationship with Greenpeace, forged in 2009 to address paper sourcing issues. In its June update, Kimberly-Clark reported absolute greenhouse gas emissions reductions of 18 percent against a 2005 baseline and a waste diversion rate of 95 percent. It's hard at work on watershed assessment, and it's frequently registered for its logistics strategy.

In the coming months, expect Morden's team to prioritize two issues upon which consumer products companies have made many commitments but have so far failed to deliver substantial progress: eliminating deforestation of old growth forests (the company was called to task in February for failing to use recycled content in toilet paper); and stopping the flow of plastics into the ocean (in collaboration with partners including Circulate Capital).

""By adopting a system-based approach with key partners, we can play a role in enabling the circular economy, one which is restorative and creates value,"" Morden said in comments accompanying the company's last update.

Over the past nine years, Neff has transformed the Los Angeles-based commercial real estate investment company — which manages about 13.2 million feet of property on the West Coast — into one of the most progressive firms in North America when it comes to embracing building designs that can withstand grid outages or demand spikes and that have far smaller emissions footprints than other commercial properties.

In September 2018, Kilroy committed to achieving carbon-neutral operations by 2020 — an aggressive target it intends to meet through a combination of on-site technology investments of both solar panels and energy storage systems as well as offsite power purchase agreements. It was also one of the small group of companies that stood up behind the World Green Building Council's new campaign committing companies and businesses to owning, operating and developing net-zero carbon buildings by 2030.

Appointed to her second stint as CARB chair in 2007 by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nichols is fighting back hard against the Trump administration's proposed rollback of fuel-economy standards — a move it has tied to a safety argument — and by its proposed interference with California's own tough emissions rules.

""As U.S. EPA’s own scientists confirmed ... the existing program is cost-effective and successful,"" Nichols noted in remarks (PDF) prepared for a hearing in late 2018. ""California and its partners are seeing ever-increasing numbers of cleaner cars, putting us on track to clean the air and address climate change. We should not suddenly slam on the breaks and go in reverse.""

With the state and EPA still wide apart in negotiations as of early February, the potential for a legal skirmish over California's ability to set its own rules seems all but certain.

A favorite target of conservative Republicans, the new Congresswoman from the Bronx known to many as AOC is the most prominent champion of the Green New Deal, a federal policy resolution for decarbonizing the United States that some in the Democratic party believe could become the framework for a wave of new infrastructure projects and clean energy investments.

The plan, which is scant on details, could create millions of high-paying jobs while advancing America's clean air, clean water and social equity agendas, AOC argues.

Living in the world as it is isn’t an argument against working towards a better future. Critics have attacked — horrified with the notion that people should drive less or cut their red meat consumption, and questioning AOC's own habits of consumption. ""Living in the world as it is isn’t an argument against working towards a better future,"" she tweeted in early March. ""The Green New Deal is about putting a LOT of people to work in developing new technologies, building new infrastructure, and getting us to 100 percent renewable energy.""

When the local utility in Las Vegas, Nevada Power, couldn't meet MGM Resorts' clean energy requirements, Ortega filed for a divorce in order to develop that strategy independently.

The breakup was expensive: MGM will pay at least $87 million for the privilege of procuring power on its own. But it barely has looked back. Last April, the hospitality company announced a deal with developer Invenergy for a 100-megawatt solar project about 25 miles north of the Las Vegas Strip. After the project becomes operational in 2020, it should supply up to 90 percent of its 13 high-wattage properties in Sin City. And Ortega was among the hospitality executives to join the ban-plastic-straws movement in July, a move that will eliminate more than 100 million straws annually.

Under her leadership, the Federal National Mortgage Association vastly has expanded the range of green financing options available for multifamily buildings. From 2012 to 2018, the company issued more than $51.7 billion in green mortgage-backed securities and $6.1 billion in green-structure securities. It was the largest green bond issuer in the world in 2017 and 2018.

Fannie Mae figures that the average building owner recoups their investments in energy efficiency and other environmental improvements within six years, while tenants have seen their annual utility expenses cut by 10 percent. ""Green bonds serve as more than an excellent investment vehicle — they are designed to target significant environmental, social and financial benefits,"" Pagitsas said in Fannie Mae's March impact report.

When it comes to procuring and consuming clean energy, Google is gigawatts ahead of most companies. It has signed contracts for an estimated 3 GW, compared with about 2 GW for Facebook and 1 GW for the likes of Amazon, Apple and Microsoft.

The lead strategist for the tech giant's energy team is an engineer with two decades of industry experience, who started her career at utility Pacific Gas & Electric and did time as an investment banker focused on electric utilities. Despite ongoing efforts to managing and reduce power consumption in its data centers, Palmer's team drives a hard bargain, but it's also creative — looking for ways to innovate with legacy utilities.

""One criteria we have is that these projects need to be new to the world,"" she said in July. ""If you had a wind farm that had been in operation for five years, that’s not going to be a project that we’re going to buy power from, because it’s already a part of the carbon mix of the grid.""

One big theme that shapes L'Oreal's sustainability strategy is empowerment. While goals such as greenhouse gas emissions reductions, water conservation and zero waste are mandated, the French company grants local managers the autonomy to guide the best path for individual locations. ""We have a culture where it's authorized to have initiatives to try new things, to find solutions, to propose solutions,"" Palt said in 2017.

Given its dependence on female consumers, Palt's keen focus on helping women around the world fight climate change is understandable, and it isn't skin-deep. The company was the first corporate sponsor of the C40 Women4Climate Initiative, where L'Oreal is funding research to heighten awareness. Palt, trained as a lawyer and human rights advocate, began her career with Amnesty International. ""I would like to encourage women to become climate leaders, because we are going to be touched in a very specific way,"" she said.

The list of ways in which retailer Target demonstrates leadership is as lengthy as its merchandise mix.

Here are just two: As of mid-2018, it was still the largest on-site corporate installer of solar power in the United States, well on its way to outfitting 500 stores; and it continues to push hard to eradicate toxic chemicals from the items on its shelves. Indeed, the story of how it collaborated with rival Walmart on that issue should become a case study in how to introduce more sustainable business practices that have relevance for an entire sector.

In late December, Target joined what looks to be another influential industry-led initiative, the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action. On the agenda: policies to guide the selection of more ""climate-friendly"" materials, the adoption of low-carbon transportation across the supply chain and support for more circular models of consumption that fight back against the ""fast fashion"" movement that sees clothing go out of style after just one season.

Citi's $100 billion commitment to environmental finance in 2015 (an extension to a previous $50 billion commitment) has contributed to a lot of ""firsts,"" including the first offshore wind farm in the United States, the first energy efficiency securitization and the first asset-backed green bond for the automotive industry.

""We are not yet at a time when all finance can be defined as sustainable finance, but we are at a time of such rapid market growth and high investor interest that this transition seems inevitable,"" Smith wrote (PDF) in a recent impact report.

The bank, a co-founder of the Green Bond Principles, took out its first green bond in January, a $1.12 billion transaction. And, lest we forget, the bank has moved quickly to embrace the reporting recommendations set forth by the G20 Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

Keep your eye on the bank's 100 percent renewable energy target, which it has committed to meet by the end of 2020.

One of 11 children born to Vietnamese immigrants, Truong has made it her life's work to fight poverty and pollution, simultaneously.

As CEO of social justice organization Dream Corps and director of its environmental activism arm, Green For All, Truong has been deeply involved in developing local, state and federal policies that have ensured that the communities harmed the most by toxic chemicals or fossil-fuels emissions or other bad corporate habits benefit directly from fees and funds meant to mitigate those behaviors. For her work on climate equity, she received a White House Champion of Change award in 2016.

Today, she is using her voice and connections to convince companies to include these communities more deeply and directly in planning their climate action and strategies. ""Step into your power,"" she urged during a plenary interview at GreenBiz 19 in late February.

The author was a senior writer for the book at the center of Project Drawdown's mission, ""Drawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed to Reverse Global Warming."" The tome talks up 80 ideas for reversing greenhouse gas emissions: the top priority is technologies that help the world (especially emerging economies) kick the hydrofluorocarbon habit. HFCs are widely used in air-conditioning and supermarket cold cases. ""These are the means of building a more equitable, healthy, prosperous, vibrant world,"" Wilkinson said during a plenary session at GreenBiz 17.

She's particularly passionate about empowering women and girls to act. Not only are they disproportionately affected by the side effects of climate change, such as floods and droughts, but they are also closer to the solutions, particularly farms. ""Support women smallholders, realize higher yields, avoid deforestation and sustain the life-giving power of forests,"" Wilkinson said during a TED Talk in December.

Schooled in geology and engineering, Zoi is an astonishingly well-rounded executive. She co-founded a software company, led a rural electrification company incubated by Sun Edison and served in the Obama and Clinton administrations — one of her federal government projects was helping pioneer the Energy Star program.

Under Zoi, EVgo has grown into the largest public fast-charging network for electric vehicles in the United States with more than 1,100 stations in 34 states serving 125,000 customers. The company plans to double its fast-charging capacity by the end of 2020.

638,Plastics Recycling Show & Awards Europe,"Today only a third of plastics is recycled in Europe, highlighting the need to revamp the current waste management systems. The whole plastic value chain must engage in the transformation of plastic production, manufacture and disposal.

Plastics Recycling Show Europe (PRSE) and Plastics Recycling Awards Europe (PRAE) are in an ideal position to aid the industry in the transition towards circular economy by bringing together key players and by recognising innovation and technological developments of the industry.

PRSE was launched in 2017 as the first show dedicated solely to plastics recycling in Europe. Since the launch the show has gained immense importance and attracted much interest, with a 70% increase in the footfall during the second edition of the show, reaching as many as 3,000 visitors and seeing a 64% increase in the number of exhibitors, reaching 111 of them.

Over the two days, the show incorporates a free exhibition and a conference, gathering under one roof major industry players such as machine manufacturers, brand owners, waste management companies, legislators and academics, in addition to the recyclers. The exhibition opens doors to the whole value chain while the conference addresses the latest trends and developments in plastics recycling.

In 2018 Cyrill Gutsch, the founder of Parley for the Oceans, was one of the key speakers of the PRSE conference. This year representatives of major brands like IKEA, Henkel, Procter & Gamble, HP and Philips will also be featured. These brands will share their views as well as their contribution to the changing landscape of plastics production and waste management. The show and the conference will be officially opened by Kestutis Sadauskas, Director Circular Economy and Green Growth at the DG Environment, European Commission, on April 10.

Given the success of the PRSE launch, the organisers introduced the Plastics Recycling Awards Europe in October 2017. The awards aim to recognise and celebrate achievements, as well as technological advancements in plastics recycling. For this year, 40 entries across seven categories have been recognised as finalists highlighting innovation in automotive, electrical and electronic, building & construction and packaging sectors among others. Additionally, the awards recognise individuals, plastics recycling ambassadors, with outstanding contributions to the European market. The quality and the variety of the entries are a testament to the expansion and improvements in this sector.

Going forward, securing an environment with sound and sustainable management of plastics production, consumption, as well as disposal, will depend on simultaneous improvements across all the steps within the value chain. Consequently, the collaboration of these actors is the starting point for this transition. PRSE and PRAE present the perfect opportunity to instigate just that, offering a unique opportunity to concur and at the same time highlight the continued improvements in the sector.",United States,2019.03

644,"Guest Article: Circular Economy Model for E-Waste Management Sector: Innovation by E-Waste Exchange, India | SDG Knowledge Hub | IISD","Today, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is transforming the world at a fast pace. While it has created an aspiration among many individuals to reap the benefits of technological development, the e-waste management sector often relies on outdated practices, and is in need of innovation.

‘Sanshodhan: An E-Waste Exchange’ is a digital platform available for corporates and society to directly transfer their electronic waste to government authorized, technically competent e-waste recyclers. “Smart, convenient, transparent, sustainable and economically valuable,” the platform aims to serve urban citizens and businesses that consume electronic and electrical equipment and to enable development of e-waste-free smart cities. E-Waste Exchange is based on the latest information technologies (IT), and seeks to foster environmental sustainability in the e-waste management sector in India and similar economies.

A startup, Sanshodhan: An E-Waste Exchange has been highlighted as a policy recommendation for India and similar economies by the EU’s Resource Efficiency Initiative (EU-REI) Project, implemented by a consortium led by Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), with The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), Confederation of the Indian Industry (CII) and adelphi.

The E-Waste Exchange partners with the Indian state Government of Telangana. Launching the platform on 7 February 2018, Jayesh Ranjan, Indian Administrative Service, Government of Telangana, highlighted the “immense value” of E-Waste Exchange as a “timely and topical” effort to organize waste management business, and its “tremendous social benefit.” In February – March 2018, E-Waste Exchange was successfully presented to the UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and to UNIDO India in June 2018. In September 2018, E-Waste Exchange was showcased during the EU’s Circular Economy Mission to India where its contribution to managing waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) and circular economy was discussed.

E-Waste Exchange won the ‘Clean India Grand Challenge,’ and was lauded by the organizers as “a ray of hope to brighten the e-waste management sector.” The initiative’s efforts to contribute to e-waste-free smart cities were also recognized by regular citizens using the platform to dispose of e-waste: “It’s an outstanding idea and very helpful for the citizens who care about environmental protection for future generations.”

E-Waste Exchange, with the Global Institute for Circular Economy and Sustainable Development Goals, developed ‘RE-CIRCULATE,’ a circular economy model for e-waste management. The model is well suited for implementation by government departments, multi-location offices, corporates, multinationals and conglomerates who are keen to: enhance their green image; contribute to SDGs 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 12 (responsible consumption and production) and 13 (climate action); implement circular economy for e-waste and associated plastics; and aim to include the positives of e-waste management into sustainability reporting. E-Waste Exchange is looking forward to partnering with corporates and multinationals to support these goals.

Founded by a group of social development and technology experts, in consultation with government departments, industry associations and citizens, Sanshodhan: An E-Waste Exchange aims to find solutions to the e-waste problem, one of the biggest social, economic and environmental challenges of our time, by addressing its root causes.

646,Fazer creates circular economy by using oat-milling residue for confectionery business,"Oat hulls contain xylose, which can be used to produce xylitol.

Producing xylitol from oat hulls, however, is a completely new innovation and the company had to develop technology for this, as the raw material, until now, has not been commercially utilized.

Currently, oat hulls are used mainly for energy production.

Work at the oat hull xylitol factory – based next to Fazer’s oat mill in Lahti, Finland – started in February and will be part of the Fazer Lifestyle Foods business area.

The factory will be the first fully backward integrated xylitol manufacturing facility in the world producing many forms of xylitol for the food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries.

Christoph Vitzthum, president and CEO of Fazer Group, said the facility is an “excellent example of an innovative circular economy solution” ​and the company plans to expand xylitol production to its mill in Sweden.

The €40m ($45m) investment in the facility is part of Fazer’s strategy to become a ‘modern sustainable company following plant-based consumer trends’.

In 2011, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) approved several health claims about oats,​​ attracting a lot of well-deserved attention.

Oat bran contains high concentrations of a fiber called beta glucan, which has been found to lower cholesterol levels, decrease the elevation of blood glucose after a meal and improve digestion and satiety.

Oats are also dense with nutrients like protein, vitamins and minerals.

Finland is one of the world’s largest oats producers with consumption at 7.3 kg per capita and rising by approximately 10% per annum, according to Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke).

It is also the second-largest exporter of oats in the world, sending about 350,000 tons abroad annually.

The xylitol market, too, is experiencing healthy growth, expected to reach $1.12bn by 2023, according to Global Market Insights.

EFSA also approved xylitol health claims,​​ including reducing the risk of tooth decay and post-prandial glycaemic responses.

The FDA has granted GRAS (generally recognized as safe) status to the plant-based ingredient’s use in food and beverages increasing scope in sugar-free chewing gum formulations.

Fazer will use the xylitol in its confectionery business – the company is the only xylitol chewing gum manufacturer in Finland – as well as targeting further distribution in the Nordic countries.

647,Fazer commits to circular economy innovation with new Finnish xylitol factory,"Finnish food manufacturer Fazer has announced a €40 million investment into a new factory for oat-based healthy sugar alternative xylitol, which is said to be an example of state-of-the-art circular economy innovation.

The dedicated factory, based in Finland, will eventually house all the company’s manufacturing processes and will set Fazer front and centre as a producer of grain-based products, capitalizing on the growing consumer desire for sustainable products.

Investing in new production technologies and solutions, xylitol has the potential for use in the cosmetics industry, among others. The factory, which has started production this month, is thought to create 30 new jobs at the site.

Christoph Vitzthum, President and CEO, Fazer Group, “We have at hand an innovation where we combine patentable new technology, healthier options to consumers and an excellent example of an innovative circular economy solution.

 “We believe that xylitol from a plant-based Nordic raw material with a Nordic origin will create interest also outside Finland and the Nordic countries, even globally. We plan to expand the xylitol production to our mill in Sweden, too. I’m proud of this example of the fearless creativity at Fazer, and we are excited about the new opportunities ahead of us.”",United States,2019.03
649,Coca – Cola sparks the change with the Fruit Circular Economy,"Coca-Cola India has a new ambition – to become a complete beverage company. Which essentially means providing more choice to the consumer by offering newer beverages and many based on fruit and fruit juices. This has been inspired by the concept of the circular economy or a virtuous economic cycle. This initiative will create a spurt in the company’s local procurement of fruit and farm level interventions and will have a positive impact on the Indian horticulture ecosystem. The two key components of this project are, launching new and innovative products and sustainable sourcing.

Product innovation and taking them to market is handled by Asim Parekh VP, Fruit Circular Economy, Coca-Cola India who says “To spark the change we’re bringing many other drinks like tea, coconut water, and juices to our customers. We are launching several new local brands at various price points and for different customer categories. Infact, we are now emulating a start up with 17 brand launches in 2018 and many more slated for 2019. We have made small teams that are quick to innovate, quick to market and adapt. Our core philosophy aided by a sustainable supply chain is about reaching customers and mapping their journeys in detail,”

This way of functioning is a big shift and is rooted in the understanding that India is not exactly a homogenous country, besides social and cultural diversity, there is economic classification. In addition, the modern consumer in big and small cities and even semi-urban areas wants personalization of their products and services. Keeping the potential growth of the economy in mind, even seemingly small customer segments could be large value generators.

One such sustainable sourcing program is Unnati Mango. The program was started to increase crop yields, save water, bring in ‘Good Agricultural practices” and improve the livelihoods of mango farmers in Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh. Emboldened by the success of the program, the company has now extended this framework to other fruits and placed it under a strategic framework called the “Fruit Circular Economy”. Under this program orange sourcing and farming initiatives were launched in 2016 across the water stressed regions of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. It encouraged the adoption of newer varieties of orange that have 50% higher juice content. Says, Ishteyaque Amjad, VP, Public Affairs, Communications and Sustainability, Coca-Cola India and South West Asia , “Entering and staying in the fruit production and processing ecosystem is part of our long term strategy and commitment to the country. Through these sustainable agricultural initiatives we plan to double farmer’s incomes. All projects under the Fruit Circular Economy framework consist of modern nurseries with high quality plants, intensive training to farmers, drip irrigation techniques and an assured buy back. About 250,000 farmers would be benefited over 10 years through these programs. At one level, these projects help the company in creating resilient high quality supply chains at another they also ensure that the shift towards juice based beverages is a smooth transition.”

Coca-Cola’s 2020 sustainability goals put sustainable sourcing of key agricultural ingredients as a top priority. Concerted efforts are being made by the company and nearly 250 bottling partners in more than 200 countries and territories to ensure this becomes a reality. The Coca-Cola Company is one of the largest buyers of Indian agricultural produce, sourcing 95% of its ingredients locally. This helps the company in sourcing high quality produce and also benefits the local farmers who get a ready market. India is the second largest producer of the fruits and vegetables in the world. The country grows the most amounts of bananas, papaya, mangoes, guavas, pomegranates and is the second largest producers of potatoes, green peas, tomatoes, cabbage and cauliflower. However, only 2.2% of fruits and vegetable output in India is processed. Coca-Cola views this as India’s untapped potential.",United States,2019.03
650,Mechanical recycling has the biggest ability to provide value to the circular economy - WPC,"LONDON (ICIS)--Mechanical recycling has the biggest potential to provide value to the circular economy, the chairman at the World Plastics Council (WPC) said on Thursday.

Jim Seward, who is also an executive at chemicals major LyondellBasell, said: “There is a hierarchy. We need to push mechanical recycling as far as it goes just because of the value it brings. That’s probably how you can bring the most value.""

Seward was speaking at the IdentiPlast conference in London.

In several European recycling markets, a shift in consumer attitudes to plastic and the resulting raft of brand commitments to minimum recycled plastic content from packaging firms has meant that demand for material outweighs supply, particularly for food-grade material.

Food grade material is that which is certified by the EU as suitable for food contact.

In markets such as recycled polyethylene terephthalate (R-PET) and recycled high density polyethylene (R-HDPE) food-grade material prices are trading above virgin material prices because of structural shortages.

For polyethylene (PE), for example, the UK is the only producer of food-grade R-HDPE.

The UK is able to produce food-grade volumes because of its natural post-consumer bale material which is sourced from used plastic milk bottles.

Across most of the rest of Europe, milk bottles are made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET).

This gives the UK a readily available separated stream of post-consumer material from food-contact applications, which is not possible in other regions of Europe.

EU legislation for food-grade contact approval stipulates that recycled input waste must be sourced from at least 98% former food contact packaging for recycling back into food-grade pellets.

With no comparative pre-separated post-consumer collection stream in mainland Europe, it is not possible to meet these targets.

Sources continue to see a shift away from virgin PE packaging to other plastics such as PET because of the lack of food-grade R-PE.

UK food-grade R-HDPE pellets are currently trading at £1,200-1,300/tonne ex-works, compared with virgin HDPE blow-moulding spot prices of €1,060-1,140/tonne FD (free delivered) NWE (northwest Europe).

Food-grade pellet recycled polyethylene terephthate (R-PET) prices, meanwhile, are trading at 25% above virgin polyethylene terephthalate (PET) on average, which is the widest spread on record.

Demand for R-PET food-grade pellets remains high on the back of the raft of sustainability commitments from beverage manufacturers in recent months, and proposed EU legislation for a minimum of 25% content by 2025 and 30% by 2030.

This has meant that despite a 25% spread between virgin PET and food-grade pellet prices, demand has not been affected, demonstrating the diminishing influence of virgin PET values on the R-PET market on the back of the increasing number of brand pledges to including minimum R-PET content in their packaging.

 Seward went on to argue that economic viability is necessary to ensure the continued growth of the circular economy.

“Sustainable viability is important, but economic viability is also important because financial incentives might not be there forever,” he said.",United States,2019.03
651,Unearthing the plan to take the EU's data centre economy full circle,"Deborah Andrews, lead partner of CEDaCI and associate professor of design at LSBU, unpacks the project aiming to develop a robust, secure and economically viable supply chain for data centre equipment

The origins of the circular economy can be traced back to the Swiss architect and economist Walter Stahel, who coined the term “cradle to cradle” as an alternative to the established product paradigm of cradle to grave.

The concept has since developed to incorporate a service economy (such as those offered by the likes of car-sharing service Zip Car), extending products’ life through reuse remanufacture and repair as well as recycling at end-of-life.

Thanks in part to advocacy from yachtswoman Ellen McArthur who was horrified by the plastic and other waste that she witnessed on her voyage around the world, the circular economy is now mainstream and being put forward as a serious alternative to the Linear ‘take-make-use-and dispose’ model.

Enter the data centre. The bricks and mortar foundation to the digital world that demand uninterrupted customer service and whose growth continues unabated; whether it’s colocation facilities provided by Equinix or Flexential or the huge hyperscalers constructed by Facebook and Google. At present, just 10 percent of the critical raw materials (CRM) from the data centre sector are recycled and recovered.

Deborah Andrews, associate professor of design at London South Bank University’s (LSBU) School of Engineering is one of a number of experts calling for the application of circular economy principles to the data centre to mitigate this mounting pile of material.

Deborah has been involved in sustainability-related research and teaching for over 20 years, a period through which the concept of sustainable building design has shifted from “innovative” to “mainstream”, as the world belatedly wakes up to issues of resource demand, population growth and waste.

Deborah’s turn to the data centre occurred when, almost a decade ago, she was invited by colleagues to supervise a PhD about data centres.

“The focus was a lifecycle / environmental impact assessment of the buildings and IT equipment and focussed on embodied impacts rather than energy consumption and operational impacts. The subject was really interesting and innovative, and, until then, there was very little research in this area.”",United States,2019.03

656,"ASU, City of Phoenix Announce Circular Economy Incubator Ventures","Arizona State University (ASU) and the city of Phoenix have selected four waste prevention and diversion ventures to participate in their circular economy incubator.

The incubator is within the Resource Innovation and Solutions Network (RISN) that supports new-to-market ventures that focus on improvements in processing or utilization of waste as a raw material for new products or energy.

“It’s a niche business accelerator for entrepreneurs in the early stages of waste-to-product innovations with the goal of helping move circular economy forward in the Phoenix area,” says Alicia Marseille, director of the RISN incubator at ASU based in Tempe, Ariz. “The RISN incubator offers ventures an opportunity to rapidly scale and transform your startup into a vehicle to solve some of the world’s greatest challenges. [It] helps ventures test their concepts, build their company and scale to market.”

The following four ventures were selected as finalists to make up the cohort:

FLI Right seeks to transform the future by building and leading an innovative coalition to develop, mature, demonstrate and transition technology solutions and services that directly impact the world's greatest challenges.

Founded at and backed by the University of Pennsylvania, rePurpose is a social enterprise that envisions a circular economy where responsibility is shared ethically by recyclers, manufacturers and consumers.

The company’s mission is to harvest eggshells from local restaurants and hotels and bake them into its treats. This helps the foodservice industry lower its environmental impact, in turn, benefitting the ecosystem. The shells are pasteurized and ground into a fine powder for maximum absorption and help build strong bones and teeth, among other benefits.

Recyclops brings recycling to areas where it isn’t traditionally available. The company has been successful in bringing recycling to these areas by innovating and leveraging technology. By hiring independent contractors with pickup trucks and using a tech-driven smart routing app, the company has been able to eliminate many of the logistical problems that kept recycling from happening in these areas.

The four ventures will come to ASU (Tempe and downtown Phoenix campuses) for a week-long immersive at the end of March to kick off their participation.

“We have a selection committee of experts from the public works and economic development teams at city of Phoenix as well as from ASU. Incubator staff are not part of the selection committee,” says Marseille. “The committee uses a pre-established grading matrix against each application to determine the best ventures to be brought into the program.”

Selected ventures are sent an offer letter via email to join and given a deadline to accept. There are no fees to apply or join the program. Once they accept, they participate in a two- to three-day immersion program in downtown Phoenix where they are onboarded by incubator staff and given hands-on technical assistance through a variety of workshops customized to fit the needs of the cohort.

After the immersion, ventures participate in the program virtually for three months and are paired with mentors and given specifics metrics to complete during their cohort term.

According to Brandie Barrett, deputy director for the city of Phoenix Public Works Department‒Government and Community Relations Division, the partnership between the city and RISN incubator creates a steady pipeline of entrepreneurs in the waste-to-product innovation space.

“As these ventures scale and grow in the RISN incubator, they become viable candidates for Reimagine Phoenix Initiative RFPs [request for proposals] designed to help the city reach its 40 percent diversion goal by the year 2020,” she says.

A Reimagine Phoenix RFP will seek entities to transform material from the waste and recycling streams into a product. If the city of Phoenix selects a bid from one of the RISN ventures as the winning proposal, these companies will establish a manufacturing operation on the RIC.

“Any venture that constructs a manufacturing or processing facility on the RIC will generate revenue for the city of Phoenix in the form of lease rates and may help the city avoid expenses related to landfilling material,” says Barrett. “The city’s transition toward a circular economy is fueled by the collaboration between the City of Phoenix Public Works Department and the RISN incubator.”

The RISN incubator is operated at ASU by the Rob and Melani Walton Sustainability Solutions Services and ASU Entrepreneurship + Innovation.

RISN is a program of the Rob and Melani Walton Sustainability Solutions Services at Arizona State University, in partnership with the city of Phoenix’s Reimagine Phoenix initiative. The program launched in January 2014 under former Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton. RISN advances integrated resource management through a global network of public and private partners using collaboration, research, innovation and application of technologies to create economic value, driving a sustainable circular economy.

“This agreement foresaw the need for a technology solutions incubator program to support development of economically viable technologies to improve waste diversion and support development of a circular economy,” says Barrett.

The RISN incubator launched in 2016 and has helped 13 companies raise $2.95 million in capital, more than $4.10 million in generated revenue, create 43 jobs and 43 internships, file three patents and launch 12 new products.

“It is anticipated that the RISN venture that won the Plastics #3-#7 Diversion Program Request for Proposal will have $5.5 million in capital investment, create 10 to 15 jobs, generate revenue for the city from a ground lease on the Resource Innovation Campus and produce savings for city operations,” says Barrett.",United States,2019.03
658,The Circular Economy Incubator Supports Many New Projects,"The circular economy incubator from the city of Phoenix and Arizona State University (ASU) is supporting a handful of new projects designed to help the city improve its processing and management of waste as a raw material.

The projects include founding a coalition to develop technology solutions that address environmental challenges, a program to harvest egg shells from restaurants and bake them into pet treats, a program to bring recycling to areas where it has not been available, and a social enterprise that aims to work with recyclers, manufacturers and consumers to ensure that ethical responsibility is shared among all parties, according to Waste 360.

The incubator, dubbed Resource Innovations and Solutions Network (RISN) offers help to projects in development, including mentors to guide the development of the programs, introduction to industry stakeholders, access to technical and circular economy experts, business training, and strategic advisement.

The first two waves of projects selected and supported by RISN generated $4.1 million in revenue, the organization says.

Startup concepts eligible for the incubator include, but are not limited to, conversion of solid waste into new material or energy; services that divert, reuse or recycle; and software applications and design services that focus on sustainability. The priority waste feedstocks from the city that the successful ventures will have access to include plastics, batteries, carpeting and carpet foam, broken furniture, mattresses, textiles, food waste, compost and plastic film.

Thirteen ventures have completed their mentorship period within the incubator, including the following:
• Renewlogy, developer of a proprietary chemical recycling process that allows plastic to be reversed back into its basic molecular structure, converting nonrecycled plastic waste into new valuable products such as high-value fuels. Renewlogy was a winner of the 2017 Arizona Innovation Open and the 2018 Sustainable Brands Innovation Open.
• Hathority, which specializes in software integration and application development in order to make societal impacts such as reduce landfill waste, improve recycling and change customer behavior.
• Recyclops, who has used mobile app technology to bring recycling and waste diversion through a sharing economy model to areas that otherwise would not have options aside from sending their trash to landfill. Both rural communities and high density multifamily residential complexes are often without recycling services.

The circular economy is a way of “rethinking progress,” says the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. “In a circular economy, economic activity builds and rebuilds overall system health. The concept recognizes the importance of the economy needing to work effectively at all scales – for large and small businesses, for organizations and individuals, globally and locally. Transitioning to a circular economy does not only amount to adjustments aimed at reducing the negative impacts of the linear economy. Rather, it represents a systemic shift that builds long-term resilience, generates business and economic opportunities, and provides environmental and societal benefits,” according to the foundation’s definition.",United States,2019.03
659,Circular economy innovation: Fazer’s new facility to produce xylitol from oat hulls,"06 Mar 2019 --- Finnish food corporation Fazer is building a manufacturing facility in Lahti, Finland, to produce xylitol from oat hulls in a circular economy innovation using completely new technology. Currently, oat hulls are used mainly for energy production, but Fazer has developed “a unique production process” which utilizes the side stream of the oat milling process.

As part of its growth strategy targeting plant-based products and solutions, Fazer is investing €40 million (US$45 million) in the oat hull-based manufacturing facility to enter the xylitol market, which, according to the company, is expected to grow.

The investment will strengthen Fazer’s position as a forerunner in value-added grain-based products. In the company’s oat milling process, a substantial amount of oat hulls are derived as a side stream. Oat hulls contain xylose which can be used to produce sugar substitute xylitol.

“We have at hand an innovation where we combine patentable new technology, healthier options to consumers and an excellent example of an innovative circular economy solution,” says Christoph Vitzthum, Fazer Group President and CEO.

“We believe that xylitol from a plant-based Nordic raw material with a Nordic origin will create interest also outside Finland and the Nordic countries, even globally.”

There are also plans to expand the xylitol production to the company’s mill in Sweden, according to Vitzthum.

The xylitol factory will be built next to Fazer’s oat mill on the Lahti site. The factory will be the first fully backward integrated xylitol manufacturing facility in the world capable of producing many forms of xylitol to cater to the supply needs of the food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries.

As consumers continue to seek healthier options to replace refined white sugar and the food industry continues to reformulate in this regard, xylitol “offers excellent potential for future product development,” according to Fazer.

The company aims to be the only manufacturer producing xylitol from a plant-based raw material of Finnish origin. In addition, xylitol is also an important ingredient for Fazer’s confectionery business – since Fazer is the only company producing chewing gum in Finland.

Work at the Fazer site in Lahti started in February. The oat hull xylitol factory will be a part of the Fazer Lifestyle Foods business area.

Fazer says it is developing its business and product portfolio with a special focus on transforming into a modern sustainable company following plant-based consumer trends. During the past three years, the company has invested approximately €195 million (US$220 million), of which €136 million (US$153 million) has been invested in Finland.

Finland is one of the world’s largest oats producers with oats consumption per capita around 7.3 kg. Moreover, the consumption of oats is increasing by approximately 10 percent a year. The health-promoting properties of this ingredient are well-known in the country and oats are applied to a diverse range of uses, particularly as a raw material for innovative food products.

The growing potential of oats was highlighted earlier this week, in our sister publication, NutritionInsight, which detailed a new initiative aimed at promoting oat consumption and boosting the export potential for high-quality oat products made by the Finnish food industry.

Industrial production of xylitol is a Finnish innovation which dates back to 1975.

Xylitol is a sweetener produced from xylose, which is found in various trees and plants, e.g., birch, beech, corn and berries. It is low in calories (60 percent of the calories in sugar) but as sweet as sugar. The most popular xylitol products are chewing gum and pastilles.

Xylitol has an approved European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) health claim and Fazer is the only domestic xylitol chewing gum manufacturer in Finland.

FoodIngredientsFirst has requested more details from Fazer.

667,How cities can transition to the circular economy,"UK-based charity, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, has released a suite of policy resources in a bid to encourage more cities to transition to a circular economy.

“When you apply the concept of a circular economy in the urban context, you’re looking to design out waste and pollution from cities, keep products and materials in use in cities and maintain their value, and regenerate natural systems in and around cities,” Miranda Schnitger, Cities Project Lead at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, told Cities Today.

The suite, called Circular Economy in Cities, was launched in partnership with professional services firm ARUP and the MAVA Foundation, and focuses on opportunities in three key urban systems—buildings, mobility, and products.

In aligning itself with the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, the new resource includes a series of case studies and policy recommendations for strategy development, urban planning, legislation, asset management, and procurement, among other things.

According to Schnitger, the benefits of introducing circular economic policies in these areas include cleaner air as a result of reduced congestion and a switch to zero-emission engines, while roads and car parks can be replaced by green spaces, leaving more land available for commerce, offices, houses, and recreation.

She also explained that the “layout and design of cities can change the way materials and products move around them” and suggested that governments have a critical role in creating a demand for more sustainable products and services in particular.

“In San Francisco, the city government has changed its procurement criteria for carpets installed in municipal buildings and construction projects to be cradle-to-cradle silver certified, with no polyurethane used, and with 45 per cent recycled content,” said Schnitger.

The foundation estimates that cities are the biggest contributors to what it calls the ‘take-make-waste’ economy, with 75 percent of natural resource consumption, up to 80 percent of carbon emissions, and half of all global waste coming from urban areas.

Following its launch, the foundation said it plans to use the Circular Economy in Cities suite to help city governments reverse these trends.",United States,2019.03
668,Reaction to the European Commission’s report on the Circular Economy,"We must praise the work done so far by EU officials to boost the transition towards a circular economy. But it’s too early to jump to conclusions, according to the European Environmental Bureau (EEB).

Europe is leading the way on the global transition to a circular economy, where waste is prevented and materials recycled, the EEB said. The comment is in response to the latest report by the European Commission on the implementation of the ‘Circular Economy Action Plan’.

The EEB is Europe’s largest network of environmental organisation with around 150 member organisations from more than 30 countries.

The report presents the main results of implementing the action plan, which was released in December 2015 and sketched out a series of measures to be discussed and adopted.

The EEB praised unprecedented measures to reduce the environmental impact of products and materials and to empower consumers. Innovation and ambitious recycling targets are also important drivers in the transition.

But a significant part of the planned measures has suffered from unjustifiable delays, while many others have only been investigated, the group added.

Stephane Arditi, a policy manager for the circular economy with the EEB, said:

The hesitations of Juncker’s team on the circular economy explain why we haven’t been able to achieve as much as we expected from the circular economy action plan. We urge the next European Commission and Parliament to engage with more courage and ambition towards the finalization of the planned actions and the discussion of the next wave of policy and economic initiatives to make the EU more circular, resilient and prosperous.

EU officials working in the European Commission will be replaced at the end of the year, while EU citizens will vote to elect new Members of the European Parliament in May.

Below are some examples of areas where the European Commission could have been more ambitious.

According to the action plan, the Commission was expected to:
• “Examine options and actions for a more coherent policy framework of the different strands of work of EU product policy in their contribution to the circular economy.“ This has so far only resulted in a staff working document, which has not been discussed by EU decision makers and stakeholders even though it was supposed to be implemented in 2018.
• “[develop] Action on false green claims, including updated guidance on unfair commercial practices” by 2016, but there is still confusion over what exactly greenwashing is.
• “ [develop] Analysis and policy options to address the interface between chemicals, products and waste legislation, including how to reduce the presence and improve the tracking of chemicals of concern in products.” This was supposed to be finalized by 2017. But we still don’t have clear policy options preventing the proliferation of toxic substances resulting from sub-standard recycling.",United States,2019.03
669,Circular Economy Stakeholder conference considers progress,"The annual Circular Economy Stakeholder Conference is taking place in Brussels tomorrow and Thursday (6 and 7 March). Day 1, hosted by the European Commission and opened by First Vice-President Frans Timmermans, Commissioner Karmenu Vella, and Commissioner Elżbieta Bieńkowska (via a video message), will explore the Circular Economy Action Plan, taking stock of its implementation.

All 54 measures under the plan launched in 2015 have now been delivered or are being implemented. The speakers at the conference will look at policies to capitalise on the current global momentum, broadening the debate to consider the circular economy as an enabler to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.

Timmermans, responsible for sustainable development, said: ""Our planet and our economy cannot survive if we continue with the 'take, make, use and throw away' approach. We need to retain precious resources and fully exploit all the economic value within them. The circular economy is about reducing waste and protecting the environment, but it is also about a profound transformation of the way our entire economy works.

“It sets a credible and ambitious path for better waste management in Europe with supportive actions that cover the full product cycle. This mix of smart regulation and incentives at EU level will help businesses and consumers, as well as national and local authorities, to drive this transformation.""

The day will conclude with an intervention by Vice-President Katainen looking ahead at 'what's next' for the circular economy.

The Commission also released the report, titled ‘A circular economy for plastics: Insights from research and innovation to inform policy and funding decisions’, which describes the current state of play of plastics in the economy, the relevant challenges and knowledge gaps, and policy recommendations and priorities for research and innovation in plastics, drawn up by experts and stakeholder groups.

In addition to further support ideas and projects reducing plastic waste and littering, this year’s edition of the Commission’s Social Innovation Competition focuses on challenging plastic waste.

The 2019 competition was launched on 28 February and applications are open until noon CET on 4 April. Three winning projects will each win €50,000.",United States,2019.03
671,Closing the loop: Commission delivers on Circular Economy Action Plan,"All 54 actions under the plan launched in 2015 have now been delivered or are being implemented. This will contribute to boost Europe’s competitiveness, modernise its economy and industry to create jobs, protect the environment and generate sustainable growth.

The European Commission today published a comprehensive report on the implementation of the Circular Economy Action Plan it adopted in December 2015. The report presents the main results of implementing the action plan and sketches out open challenges to paving the way towards a climate-neutral, competitive circular economy where pressure on natural and freshwater resources as well as ecosystems is minimised. The findings of the report will be discussed during the annual Circular Economy Stakeholder Conference taking place in Brussels on 6 and 7 March.

First Vice-President Frans Timmermans, responsible for sustainable development, said: “Circular economy is key to putting our economy onto a sustainable path and delivering on the global Sustainable Development Goals. This report shows that Europe is leading the way as a trail blazer for the rest of the world. At the same time more remains to be done to ensure that we increase our prosperity within the limits of our planet and close the loop so that there is no waste of our precious resources.”

Vice-President Jyrki Katainen, responsible for jobs, growth, investment and competitiveness, said: “This report is very encouraging. It shows that Europe is on the right track in creating investment, jobs and new businesses. The future potential for sustainable growth is huge and Europe is indeed the best place for an environmentally-friendly industry to grow. This success is the result of European stakeholders and decision-makers acting together.”

Three years after adoption, the Circular Economy Action Plan can be considered fully completed. Its 54 actions have now been delivered or are being implemented. According to the findings of the report, implementing the Circular Economy Action Plan has accelerated the transition towards a circular economy in Europe, which in turn has helped putting the EU back on a path of job creation. In 2016, sectors relevant to the circular economy employed more than four million workers, a 6% increase compared to 2012.

Circularity has also opened up new business opportunities, given rise to new business models and developed new markets, domestically and outside the EU. In 2016, circular activities such as repair, reuse or recycling generated almost €147 billion in value added while accounting for around €17.5 billion worth of investments.

The EU Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy is the first EU-wide policy framework adopting a material-specific lifecycleapproach to integrate circular design, use, reuse and recycling activities into plastics value chains. The strategy sets out a clear vision with quantified objectives at EU level, so that inter alia by 2030 all plastic packaging placed on the EU market is reusable or recyclable.

To boost the market for recycled plastics, the Commission launched a voluntary pledging campaign on recycled plastics. 70 companies have already made pledges, which will increase the market for recycled plastics by at least 60% by 2025. However, there is still a gap between supply and demand for recycled plastics. To close this gap, the Commission launched the Circular Plastics Alliance of key industry stakeholders supplying and using recycled plastics.

The rules on Single-Use Plastics items and fishing gear, addressing the ten most found items on EU beaches place the EU at the forefront of the global fight against marine litter. The measures include a ban of certain single-use products made of plastic (such as straws and cutlery) when alternatives are available and of oxo-degradable plastic, and propose actions for others such as consumption reduction targets, product design requirements and Extended Producers Responsibility schemes.

To accelerate the transition to a circular economy, it is essential to investin innovation and to provide support for adapting Europe’s industrial base. Over the period 2016-2020, the Commission has stepped up efforts in both directions totalling more than €10 billion in public funding to the transition.

To stimulate further investments, the Circular Economy Finance Support Platform has produced recommendations to improve the bankability of circular economy projects, coordinate funding activities and share good practices. The platform will work with the European Investment Bank on providing financial assistance and exploiting synergies with the action plan on financing sustainable growth.

Sound and efficient waste management systems are an essential building block of a circular economy. To modernise waste management systems in the Union a revised waste legislative frameworkentered into force in July 2018. This includes, among others, new ambitious recycling rates, clarified legal status of recycled materials, strengthened waste prevention and waste management measures, including for marine litter, food waste, and products containing critical raw materials.

Smart design at the beginning of a product’s lifecycle is essential for ensuring circularity. With the implementation of the Ecodesign Working Plan 2016-2019, the Commission has further promoted the circular design of products, together with energy efficiency objectives. Ecodesign and Energy Labelling measures for several products now include rules on material efficiency requirements such as availability of spare parts, ease of repair, and facilitating end-of-life treatment. The Commission has also analysed, in a dedicated Staff Working Document, its policies for products, with the intention to support circular, sustainable products.

The transition towards a more circular economy requires an active engagement of citizens in changing consumption patterns. The Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) and Organisation Environmental Footprint (OEF) methods developed by the Commission can enable companies to make environmental claims that are trustworthy and comparable and consumers to make informed choices.

Stakeholder engagement is vital for the transition. The systemic approach of the action plan has given public authorities, economic and social players and civil society a framework to replicate in order to foster partnerships across sectors and along value chains. The role of the Commission in speeding up the transition and leading international efforts for circularity was also recognised at the World Economic Forum 2019 where the Commission received the Circulars Award in the Public Sector Category.

The circular economy is now an irreversible, global trend. Yet, much is still needed to scale up action at EU level and globally, fully close the loop and secure the competitive advantage it brings to EU businesses. Increased efforts will be needed to implement the revised waste legislation and develop markets for secondary raw materials. Also, the work started at EU level on some issues (like chemicals, the non-toxic environment, eco-labelling and eco-innovation, critical raw materials and fertilisers) needs to be accelerated if Europe wants to reap the full benefit of a transition to a circular economy.

Interaction with stakeholders suggests that some areas not yet covered by the action plan could be investigated to complete the circular agenda. Building on the example of the European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy, many other sectors with high environmental impact and potential for circularity such as IT, electronics, mobility, the built environment, mining, furniture, food and drinks or textiles could benefit from a similar holistic approach to become more circular.

In 2015, the Commission adopted an ambitious new Circular Economy Action Plan to stimulate Europe’s transition towards a circular economy, which would boost global competitiveness, foster sustainable economic growth and generate new jobs. It was foreseen that the proposed actions would contribute to “closing the loop” of product lifecycles through greater recycling and re-use, and bring benefits for both the environment and the economy. The plans would help extract the maximum value and use from all raw materials, products and waste, fostering energy savings and reducing greenhouse gas emissions and would be supported financially by ESIF funding, Horizon 2020, the EU structural funds and investments in the circular economy at national level.

A full state of play of the implementation of the action plan is presented in an accompanying Staff Working Document.",United States,2019.03

674,Circular Polymers offers used carpet end market,"Sometimes, making the right choice is the differentiator between average and extraordinary. This can be said of many things: hiring an employee, buying a new car, ordering dinner at a restaurant—the list goes on. The same sentiment can also be said of choosing the right equipment for a demolition job. Many demolition attachments may work OK for a particular application, but selecting the perfect attachment for the task at hand has the potential to help contractors finish a project more efficiently and effectively than they otherwise could.

With hundreds of sizes and styles of demolition attachments on the market ranging from small grapples to massive pulverizers, contractors can’t expect to blindly pick an option, attach it to an excavator and get top production. Rather, today’s demolition professionals should refine their demolition attachment selection process in order to knock out jobs faster and easier. Considering the application, the carrier, the return on investment and other variables can help contractors better find the right tool for the job in question.

Before selecting a tool, it is important to first consider the type of work the attachment will perform. From primary to secondary demolition and from rebar-enforced concrete to wood and brick, the application should be the first factor to guide an attachment choice.

When starting to demolish a structure, multi-quick processors, shears, crushers, pulverizers and demolition grapples tend to be the top picks for primary demolition. The choice between them depends on the type of material being targeted and how it needs to be broken up.

Crusher and pulverizer attachments, for example, best tackle jobs made up of mostly concrete. Choose a crusher if the structure is composed of concrete with little or no rebar and if it’s necessary to break the concrete into chunks large enough for easy sorting and recycling. A pulverizer attachment better handles concrete that’s heavily reinforced with rebar. Unlike the crusher attachment, the pulverizer will break the concrete into small pieces and cut through the embedded rebar, allowing the concrete to fall to the ground rather than hang onto the metal reinforcements.

Pulverizers also can be used to break concrete into manageable sizes during secondary demolition. If the demolition involves both crushing concrete and cutting steel, contractors should consider combi-crushers that incorporate both cutting edges and teeth.

If concrete isn’t part of the demolition picture but steel is, a demolition processor with shear jaws or a mobile shear attachment will work best since they’re able to cut through steel better than a tool meant for multiple types of material.

When working jobs with light materials (such as wood and brick, which are commonly found in residential demolition applications), use a demolition grapple. Besides breaking apart materials, rotating grapples work well for sorting during secondary demolition and increase versatility and productivity by allowing a wide range of movement.

For versatility across different demolition jobs, a multi-quick processor often fits best. The attachment’s interchangeable jaws can handle a multitude of materials. The jaw types found on multi-quick processors include crushers, pulverizers, a combination of both and steel-cutters. Some manufacturers offer additional specialty options, such as jaws for cutting through timber for forest industry applications; jaws for cutting steel tanks, pipes and vessels; and highly powerful jaws for heavily reinforced concrete.

While multi-quick processors may cost more than other attachments (approximately 15 to 20 percent more than crushers, for example), they more than make up for that difference in price with their versatility afforded by their interchangeable jaw sets.

After determining the best type of attachment for the job, contractors should consider the technology powering the tool. Cylinders power demolition attachments, and typically, the larger the cylinder, the more powerful the tool. Because of this, contractors seeking more demolition power in the past had to buy or rent a larger excavator to handle the larger attachment. That’s no longer the case.

As manufacturers incorporate more technology into the attachments they build, some are able to achieve as much as 25 percent more power without increasing the cylinder size. To pull this off, manufacturers build additional chambers into the cylinder to allow for as much as 20 percent more surface area. Often, this results in an attachment with the same power as a tool two sizes larger. This means that a section of concrete that may take a competitive crusher attachment five or six “bites” to break through only takes the tool with the enhanced cylinder technology one or two.

This advancement in technology gives contractors access to amplified crushing and cutting forces they previously couldn’t have achieved without the expense of investing in a larger tool, as well as a bigger carrier to operate that tool. In addition to the cost of the tool itself, larger carriers also come with higher operating costs. The high power-to-weight ratio made possible by more efficient tools—higher on attachments with this technology than any other tool in its size class—also opens the door to more efficient high-reach demolition. This is both because contractors can use smaller carriers and because the attachment’s lightweight and superior cylinder technology improves tool performance and fuel efficiency.

Some attachments with innovative cylinder technology reduce carrier fuel consumption by up to 20 percent compared to other models. In some cases, the attachment’s efficient design allows it to function normally when the carrier is set in economy mode, achieving the same performance as competitive attachments on an excavator running at full throttle.

In addition, this advanced cylinder technology allows manufacturers to better design high-performing attachments. When combined with double-acting speed valves, the advanced attachment designs not only offer improved power and efficiency, but also improved productivity. Together, the enhanced cylinder design and double-acting speed valves deliver faster cycle times—from 3.8 seconds to 5 seconds on bigger tools—and as much as 20 percent more power than conventional cylinders.

Of course, the best attachment in the world still needs a suitable carrier to perform well. Contractors should be sure to match the attachment to the appropriate carrier size and weight. Heavier attachments, naturally, require larger, heavier carriers that cost more to operate. Using too heavy of an attachment can cause excessive wear to the excavator and will affect performance. In addition, tools that are too heavy for a machine present a safety risk for other workers near the carrier. Conversely, an attachment that is too small reduces productivity.

Professionals should also ensure the carrier has enough hydraulic capacity to feed the attachment when considering the right tool for the job. Inadequate flow or hydraulic pressure will slow the tool’s cycle times, reducing productivity. Too little pressure also results in less closing force or torque, depending on the attachment.

Another item to check is the attachment’s hydraulic circuit requirements. Is the excavator equipped with enough auxiliary hydraulic circuits for the attachment? For example, rotation shears and multi-quick processors require two double-acting hydraulic circuits—one circuit for opening and closing the jaw and one for 360-degree rotation. Attachments that don’t rotate, such as static pulverizers or shears, only require one double-acting circuit.

When determining the attachment best suited for the application and power rating, look for a product that is durable and easy to service. Some attachments may seem like a great investment at first but end up resulting in a nightmare of downtime and repair costs when put into operation.

One method for choosing a low-maintenance attachment is to find a tool with no (or very few) protruding parts, such as hydraulic hoses. These can be easily damaged during operation, particularly in harsh demolition environments. Instead, contractors should look for attachments that have components that are enclosed within the tool, yet are still easy to access through service openings.

Contractors will also be wise to keep wear part service life in mind when choosing a tool. For example, shear and crushing attachments’ cutting edges and teeth need to be replaced when worn. While exchangeable cutting edges are an industry standard, it’s still smart to ensure they are available.

When considering multi-quick processors, operators should pay attention to how quickly jaws can be switched out. Some manufacturers build multi-quick processors with jaws that operators can change within minutes on-site, compared to the hours needed to bring many other attachments back to the shop to exchange. Workers may only need to manually remove one pin from quick-exchange models during change-outs, compared to the three pins that need to be removed from many other manufacturers’ processors. The rest of the jaw exchange process is done hydraulically from the safety of the cab. This system not only removes the hassle of pounding out two or three pins, but also virtually eliminates the danger of the jaw falling and injuring a worker after the last pin is removed.

With most jobs, the best tool depends on the situation. Seasoned buyers and industry newbies alike can benefit from taking a careful look at their options and requirements while searching for a new attachment. Additionally, it’s always a good idea to get advice from the dealer and manufacturer.

Picking the best pairing of tool and carrier goes beyond the application and the power that can be achieved. Contractors should examine every aspect of the attachment and the subsequent carrier to form a pair that will boost productivity and ROI and, potentially, open up opportunities to work in new applications. While making a wise equipment choice might take a little foresight, selecting the right tools for the job can help demolition professionals take their job site performance to new heights.

677,Challenge Invites Solutions to Plastic Waste Crisis in Ocean | News | SDG Knowledge Hub | IISD,"February 2019: National Geographic and Sky Ocean Ventures launched an ‘Ocean Plastic Innovation Challenge’ that invites problem solvers to develop innovative solutions to tackle the world’s plastic waste. The competition will focus on three complementary tracks: design, circular economy and data visualization.

The one-year Ocean Plastic Innovation Challenge focuses on three ways to address plastic waste: designing alternatives to single-use plastic; identifying opportunities for business and consumers to tackle plastic waste through supply chains; and communicating the need for action on plastic waste through data visualization.

The design track encourages teams to identify practical, investable solutions to improve food and beverage packaging and containers. The circular economy track asks teams to develop scalable technology solutions and business models to reduce plastic packaging waste and encourage movement away from a single-use plastic economy towards the reuse and repurposing of plastic alternatives. Solutions in this track should focus on scalable innovations and models that are applicable across industries. The data visualization track challenges teams to produce compelling visual messaging about the global plastic crisis, using a relevant, credible data set on plastic waste, to accelerate behavior change and inspire action to reduce plastic waste.

Registration for the challenge opened on 11 February 2019. Teams must submit initial proposals by 11 June 2019. Finalists will be identified on 8 July 2019. They will pitch solutions to a panel of expert judges on 9 December 2019.

The Challenge will award an aggregate prize amount of up to USD 500,000. Qualified participating teams may receive a minimum of USD 1 million in aggregate investment from Sky Ocean Ventures.

Efforts to address plastic pollution and move towards a circular economy can support progress on SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15 (life on land).

678,The Big Climate Issue We Need to Focus on in 2019: Textiles and Circularity,"On a Friday afternoon last November, the United States was shaken by the Fourth National Climate Assessment (NCA). From wildfires in California to crop failure in the Midwest, the report laid out the devastating impact climate change is having and will continue to have on the United States. The key takeaway? They are expecting a severe economic and humanitarian crisis to hit our world by 2040.

The NCA touched on important topics such as coal, energy, forestry, oil and transportation, but another industry was completely left off the list: Textile production and waste. While 2018 saw continued awareness and education on the topic, we need to do more than just talk — we need feasible solutions to reduce textile waste and increase circularity in the industry.

Last year, I talked about how we are all stakeholders in the fashion industry. This year, I want to build on that and encourage all of the stakeholders — brands and consumers — to work together to move the needle, as we look to mitigate fashion and textile waste impact over the next two decades.

From the natural resources that are used to create our clothing to the number of textiles that end up in landfills when they could be reused, the fashion industry has become one of the world’s top polluters.

While the numbers are troublesome and there is more work to be done, 2018 was a year of progress among brands. To do even more, together, it is vital we capitalize on a circular economy — a common thread between brands and consumers. At the core of a circular economy is a model that’s focused on durability, reusability and renewability.

Here are a few ways we can level up our efforts:

Influencers in the reuse space need to work together to shift consumer mindsets. At Savers®, we do this by encouraging people to embrace circular behaviors such as buying used instead of new and giving their unwanted items a new home, rather than throwing them in the trash. We must take advantage of the most sustainable items — the ones that already exist.

For the consumer, positive impact means taking an active role in supporting the brands that are working to make a meaningful difference today. The more consumers reward brands that put an emphasis on circular business practices, the more brands will want to do the right thing. After all, consumers are a brand’s single driving force.

In its sustainability trend report, J. Walter Thompson Intelligence shared that 90 percent of consumers believe brands have a responsibility to take care of the planet and its people. This means companies are expected to employ their resources and innovate together to develop the technology necessary to make recycled and regenerated fibers a real possibility. Improving society and doing well go hand in hand, and brands don’t have to sacrifice one for the other. A collective breakthrough would not only transform the sustainability of the entire industry, it could also be the single greatest environmental impact of a generation.

Looking ahead, I’m optimistic that with a greater commitment, we can achieve the change needed to help improve the conditions of our planet before 2040.

I’m encouraging an open dialogue between brands and consumers to discuss each other’s challenges, goals and advances. I hope 2019 finds us exploring, learning and innovating together as we work toward circularity.

Our future depends on it.",United States,2019.03
679,European industry maps chemicals added to plastics,"A list of chemicals and their uses will support risk assessments and circular economy plans

It has been a decade since Europe started a huge ""no data, no market"" program requiring the chemical industry to prove the safety of chemicals placed on the market in European Union countries.

The project has produced a treasure trove of information helping regulators to more effectively identify and control chemicals that cause concerns for human health or the environment as well as helping industry to build consumer confidence in the chemicals. But the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) didn't stop there. The most recent project to make use of this wealth of new data targets the chemicals added to plastics.

Chemicals that were once dismissed as eternally trapped in a plastic matrix have raised concerns in recent years about whether they can migrate into our food or bodies, where they end up when plastic products reach the end of their often-too-short lives, as well as how they impact hopes for a circular economy. So the ECHA mined their new database to identify all of the chemicals which had been registered by industry as plastic additives.

The ECHA handed this list over to industry associations, which worked to ensure correct information on the uses of chemicals in plastics is available. Maggie Saykali of the European Chemical Industry Council reflects on how much was learned during this exercise: “It was clear from the start of the project that we needed all project partners to use the same terminology for uses of plastic additives."" But in the end it proved worthwhile, again in the words of Ms. Saykali:

The reinforcement of the communication channels between suppliers and users of plastic additives will also help as plans for a circular economy for plastics proceed. The additives pose one of the major obstacles to the up-cycling of plastics. An agile and responsive supply chain is a key asset for evaluating changes that can favor better recyclability of plastics back into high-value products.

An overview of the results of the mapping exercise for plastics additives has been made public by ECHA, offering consumers interesting insights to what chemicals are in which plastics. Even more data remains in the hands of the regulators of the EU Member States, who take the lead in identifying the chemicals of concern. The model for predicting potential release will also inform decisions about how to prioritize risk assessments for these chemicals.

This plastic additive mapping exercise offers another great example of the value of putting the burden on industry to share information about the chemicals they use in the interest of better protection of public health and the environment. And it is a further step in helping the industry to build trust for the chemicals that provide benefits while eliminating the use of chemicals that don't merit that trust.

He is currently on a US-Ireland Fulbright scholarship to study how sustainability research institutes engage interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research to achieve more robust research outcomes.



 Total global consumption exceeds the planet’s regenerative capacity by more than 50%; there is broad consensus that an “absolute decoupling” of consumption from resource use and environmental impact is a necessary for a sustainable society. This talk will focus on a shift to a new circular economy, which promises to reduce environmental impact, increase the security of supplies, and produce new business opportunities.

684,What Fashion Can Learn from Other Industries Promoting a Circular Economy,"Across industries, companies are eschewing the idea of a traditional linear economy of “make-use-dispose,” in exchange for a more sustainable, circular one. In a circular economy, resources are kept in use for as long as possible to extract their maximum value, recovered through reuse and recycling, and regenerated to design out waste and pollution.

This shift is steadily growing. There is a still a long path ahead to adopting a truly circular economy overall, but many industries are already making a change.

In the apparel industry in particular, circularity has dominated conversations in board rooms, conference halls and the media. At DuPont Biomaterials, it’s been our key focus to create a systemic change across several industries — including fashion — ultimately reducing waste by creating bio-based, high-performance products that are more durable, are used longer and can be recycled at the end of their useful life.

There’s been a slow but steady shift among the fashion community to focus on a more sustainable industry. Many members of the supply chain, from textiles manufacturers to designers, are already embracing a circular economy model, and the need is critical. In fact, according to the US EPA, textile waste occupies nearly 5 percent of all landfill space, and the average US citizen throws away 70 pounds of clothing and other textiles annually.

Consumers, however, are not adopting sustainable consumption at the same pace, so it’s up to industry leaders to create meaningful change by recycling and reusing materials, increasing the longevity of products, and sourcing bio-based materials such as Sorona® that are derived from nature and not only reduce dependence on fossil fuels, but also GHG emissions.

Collaboration is also pushing circular fashion forward. Many apparel brands are coming together through Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Make Fashion Circular initiative, which was launched at the 2018 Copenhagen Fashion Summit. The initiative — championed by several notable brands, including Stella McCartney, PVH and Nike, among others — aims to address the fashion industry’s pollution and waste, and drive collaboration among key stakeholders to radically redesign its operating model towards a circular system.

Sustainability in fashion is consistently making headlines, but there are several other industries that have been pioneering a push towards a circular economy as well — and the fashion community may be able to take notes.

The food sector has an enormous opportunity to pivot towards a circular economy — helping to ensure that as a society, we are not consuming more resources than the Earth can provide. For example, food brands can close nutrient loops and foster regenerative agriculture by returning organic matter to the soil in the form of composted byproducts and food wastes. As a result of this practice, soil structure improves and carbon sequestration strengthens, reducing overall emissions. The food industry can also embrace urban and peri-urban agriculture, or growing food closer to its location of consumption, to reduce the carbon footprint caused by transportation and packaging.

For example, Lufa Farms — a Montreal food company pioneering urban farming — established the world’s first commercial rooftop hydroponic greenhouse in 2011. The company leveraged existing, unutilized roof space in urban environments to help feed growing cities. The farms’ cooling effect in summer and insulation effect in winter reduced building energy demands and attenuated flows into stormwater drains. Innovative solutions and out-of-the-box thinking of this kind could also prove successful for companies in the fashion industry.

Food companies are also seeing success through collaborating to achieve a circular food system. The EAT Foundation and World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) launched a program called Food Reform for Sustainability and Health (FReSH) that aims to drive change across food systems by taking into account local eating patterns and working with 200 global companies to deliver sustainable business solutions. Fashion brands should take the same cue to collaborate and help build a more circular apparel industry; and in fact, many already are through programs such as the Make Fashion Circular initiative.

Similar to the fashion industry, circularity in the tech industry can involve recycling parts from or refurbishing laptops, phones, and other devices to reduce waste and increase efficiencies. According to niche company Circular Computing, in the EU, 160 million laptops are manufactured annually, with 160,000 disposed of daily — yet 70 percent could be reused. This issue was a catalyst for the company, which focuses on reintegrating used parts into IT systems. The goal of circular computing is to create a more ethical, sustainable and socially responsible way to buy enterprise IT. To date, the initiative has prevented 3.6 tons of waste and 950 tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. This focus on reusing and reintegrating materials into new products can be — and is — an integral part of the fashion industry’s shift towards a more sustainable and ultimately circular model.

Major brands are also leading circular economy programs, such as HP, which is increasingly incorporating recycled plastic into printers. The HP ENVY Photo All-in-One Printer series became the world’s first in-class printer made with closed-loop, recycled plastic — more than 10 percent by weight. Additionally, in 2017, the brand used plastic from bottles collected on streets and canals in Port-au-Prince, Haiti to create ink cartridges; and recently joined NextWave Plastics, a coalition of companies incorporating ocean-bound plastic into their supply chains.

As with many industries, there’s a great opportunity for tech brands to champion consumer education around circularity, and provide consumers with the information and resources necessary for repair and recycling options.

Through innovation and collaboration, all industries, from fashion to food to technology, can make significant change towards adopting a circular economy in the long term. DuPont Biomaterials — along with hundreds of other global brands — are joining forces via Circular Economy 100 (CE100), an innovation program bringing together companies, governments and cities, academic institutions, emerging innovators and affiliates to learn and collaborate around building the circular economy. This partnership of forward-thinking businesses from across a wide range of industries can truly make a difference and set a new standard for sustainability moving forward.",United States,2019.03
687,Commission delivers on Circular Economy Action Plan,"The European Commission has published a comprehensive report on the implementation of the Circular Economy Action Plan it adopted in December 2015.

All 54 actions under the plan have now been delivered or are being implemented. This will contribute to boost Europe's competitiveness, modernise its economy and industry to create jobs, protect the environment and generate sustainable growth.

The report presents the main results of implementing the action plan and sketches out open challenges to paving the way towards a climate-neutral, competitive circular economy where pressure on natural and freshwater resources as well as ecosystems is minimised.

First Vice-President Frans Timmermans, responsible for sustainable development, said: ""Circular economy is key to putting our economy onto a sustainable path and delivering on the global Sustainable Development Goals. This report shows that Europe is leading the way as a trail blazer for the rest of the world. At the same time more remains to be done to ensure that we increase our prosperity within the limits of our planet and close the loop so that there is no waste of our precious resources.""

Vice-President Jyrki Katainen, responsible for jobs, growth, investment and competitiveness, added: ""This report is very encouraging. It shows that Europe is on the right track in creating investment, jobs and new businesses. The future potential for sustainable growth is huge and Europe is indeed the best place for an environmentally-friendly industry to grow. This success is the result of European stakeholders and decision-makers acting together.""

690,Stella McCartney's Vision for Fall 2019 Is Utilitarian in More Ways Than One,"A core tenet of Stella McCartney's business has always been her commitment to the planet, whether that be through her vegan-only materials or her campaigns and initiatives aimed at making the rest of the fashion industry eco-friendly, too. Her most recent campaign, There She Grows, recruited her celebrity friends to dedicate trees in the Leuser Ecosystem in Sumatra, Indonesia to raise awareness and funds to protect the endangered area.

That campaign made it onto the runway quite literally, with names from hashtagged Instagram posts printed straight onto the flooring inside the Opéra Garnier. But the spirit made it into the Fall 2019 collection as well: McCartney looked to the Northern soul for inspiration this season, creating loose, wide-leg trousers for men and women, strong-shouldered — yet sensual — dresses and curb-stomping, crepe-soled platform boots that grounded the look. Fans of the great outdoors will likely enjoy McCartney's collaboration with British brand Hunter (her husband, Alasdhair Willis, is the company's creative director) for rubber boots that tick her sustainable box; they were fitted with Yulex socks, apparently a sustainable alternative to neoprene. (For those who are just fans of McCartney's aesthetic, there was a lovely horse print, something of a signature for the designer.)

The sustainability ethos was quite literally woven into the collection as well, which saw McCartney upcycling her own vintage fabrics for patchwork jackets, dresses made from T-shirts which were ripped up and knitted back together, menswear coats made from repurposed waxed materials and the use of sustainable viscose, organic cotton and eco-canvas throughout. The collection also featured a ""fur-free fur,"" which has the weight of a fur coat with the lightness of feathers.

Extra special were the brightly colored accessories, a collaboration between McCartney and artist Sheila Hicks, made using indigenous weaving techniques. Used as belts or sashes, they provided a punch of energy to the otherwise earthy color palette. The show notes also indicated that the use of circle hardware on the menswear was a reference back to ""Stella's hope for a circular economy"" — though, sometimes, a buckle is just a buckle.

691,Circular Polymers turns post-consumer carpet into high-quality feedstock,"Chemical recycling as an alternative to mechanical recycling appears to be a growing industry. Critical to the success of these chemical recycling companies, however, is the availability of feedstock materials. The most recent company to make an entrance into this supply process, Circular Polymers (Lincoln, CA) says the answer to availability is under your feet.

Circular Polymers, founded by a team of recycling industry veterans in 2018, will supply the chemical recycling industry with consistent, high-quality feedstock made from post-consumer carpet and other plastic destined for landfill. Circular Polymers’ new facility in Lincoln, CA, will process some 30 million pounds of carpet per year, with plans to expand further.

Circular Polymers gained the exclusive rights to a proprietary carpet recycling technology developed by Broadview Group International LLC (BGI; Brookpark, OH). This “market-disruptive technology” has been quietly optimized by Circular and BGI over the past year, according to BGI’s information. “Our technology disassembles the carpet then cleans the fibers, thus maximizing yield while providing superior quality,” stated BGI President Joe Bork. “The technology processes all carpet types: Nylon 6, nylon 66, PET and polypropylene.”

David Bender, Circular Polymers CEO, said, “Chemical recycling is the solution to global demand for recycled feedstocks in a circular economy. Major brand companies working with chemical recyclers need clean, sustainable supplies of feedstock. We understand that chemical recycling operations require the conversion of waste into a raw material with strictly defined specifications.

Circular Polymers is uniquely positioned to supply this growing industry,” said Bender. “With more than 25% of all recycled bottles getting downcycled into carpet and fiber, Circular Polymers has created a figure 8 in the circular economy, enabling upcycling of carpet into bottles.”

Circular Polymers and BGI completed the Lincoln plant expansion in December 2018. “Circular Polymers expects to grow significantly to support our customer requirements,” said Nick Fiore, Circular’s President. “The chemical recycling industry is in its infancy. Four billion pounds of carpet landfilled annually provides the feedstock for growth.”

According to BGI, the patented thermal technology is designed to recycle both short-nap and continuous-loop carpet, as well as the longer-nap cut-pile type that is more prominent in the United States. The process is designed to recover 95% of the face fiber (nylon 6; nylon 6,6; and polyester) while producing a finished material with less than 1% polypropylene and less than 2% inorganic materials (ash).

Circular Polymers’ partner PureCycle Technologies is commercializing a patented recycling process that transforms plastic waste feedstock into virgin-like resin. David Brenner, PureCycle Chief Integration Officer, commented, “We need innovators at all levels of the supply chain to make the circular economy a reality. What Circular Polymers has done with processing post-consumer carpet back into raw materials for chemical recyclers is not only revolutionary, but an incredible model for us all, considering the large volumes of feedstock that are being landfilled today.”

Mark Babich, Relationship Partner for Circular Polymers, added, “In addition to providing feedstock for chemical recycling, Circular Polymers’ fiber can also be further mechanically processed as feedstock pellet for automotive, injection molding and other upcycled applications.”

Circular Polymers received a grant from Carpet America Recovery Effort (CARE) in December 2018 to add new BGI equipment to remove and separate the polypropylene backing fiber from the carpet face fiber. “Circular Polymers is now the leading innovator of carpet recycling technology and our fastest growing recycler,” commented Bob Peoples, Executive Director of CARE. “I am very proud of what this talented team has been able to accomplish. They are proving a circular economy is achievable.”",United States,2019.03
692,Consumerism’s unexpected consequences,"The history of the United States is heavily influenced by our belief in a relatively free market and capitalistic economy. Nevertheless, that does not mean we do not, occasionally, give it some assistance. This country began as a largely agricultural economy, from vegetables to tobacco, orchards to cotton, dairy farms to cattle ranches. The end of the Civil War, the Industrial Age, and the Great Depression heralded a migration to the cities and a growth in manufactured goods.

WWII saw factories converted to munitions, men gone from the landscape, and women entering the workforce. The end of the “war to end all wars” saw men returning to jobs, not all women relinquishing their employment, and a need for increased sales to sustain the economy. With long missing goods in ready supply, buying was now considered patriotic.

The G.I. Bill rewarded those who served with the ability to purchase an American dream – and fill it. So began our affair with consumerism, abetted by the development of a new, cheap, waterproof, and durable material called “plastic”. The emerging Madison Avenue advertising agencies used techniques like “band wagon” and “status symbol sales” to convince us to want what we did not need. Now the manufacturers, the distributors, and the retail shops, plus the transportation industry, the extractors and the loggers, and the trash industry could employ all those who needed work so they had the money to buy the products. A circular economy!

Somehow, during this development, convenience surpassed quality. “Quick and easy” became the watchwords and led to the development of one-time use objects, designed to be purchased, used, and immediately thrown “away”. Grocery (and later, other) stores started providing “free” shopping bags. Restaurants offered straws and “take-home boxes”. Companies began manufacturing small plastic bottles and filing them with individual servings of soda, juice, tea, even water! Sometime in the 50s “TV dinners”, now called “microwave meals”, made an appearance. More recently came “Cup-a-Soup” and, later, “Lunchables”. While these products and packaging options are understandably handy, the non-recyclable or, more often, not recycled aspects are a detriment to our society.

While not the only culprit, plastic never decomposes fully. Fast forward seventy-plus years. Our trash burial grounds are overflowing, necessitating berms to increase the depth above ground. Trash litters the landscape, plastic gets caught in the trees and on the antlers of the wildlife. Our oceans now contain islands made of discarded plastic, and as these objects partially decompose the minute pieces fill the bellies of the ocean wildlife as well, eventually entering even OUR food steam.

We are still “keeping up with the Joneses” with bigger houses, and lots of “stuff”. We need a new circular economy encompassing responsible manufacture, efficient use, and ecological disposal returning the raw ingredients to reuse. We must develop new standards for purchasing: efficiency versus size, quality versus the immediate savings inherent in planned obsolescence, use of recycled materials, options for disposal once expended, and energy consumption. This is not a complete list but merely a beginning to start the thought process. Know the true costs. Each of us must research the options and set our own levels of participation. Most of all – Don’t accept what you don’t need, even if it is “free”.

695,"Fashion Retailers, Non-Profits and NYC Government Band Together to Divert Clothing from Landfills","Reformation, ThredUp, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the New York Department of Sanitation are just a few of the parties involved.

Anyone who's roamed the streets of New York City the night before garbage collection knows that New Yorkers throw out plenty of perfectly good things. And it's not just bulky items like the couch that wouldn't fit in the new apartment, either — there's also a whole lot of fashion that gets trashed.

According to the City of New York Department of Sanitation (or DSNY), New Yorkers send 200 million pounds (!) of clothing, shoes and bags to landfill each year. That volume is enough to make the waste problem a concern not just for local city officials, but for anyone who cares about fashion's impact on the environment.

That's why the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a British charity dedicated to advocating for a circular economy, decided to get involved. On Monday, the Foundation announced a new campaign called #WearNext. While it's spearheaded by the non-profit's Make Fashion Circular initiative — which is predicated on eliminating fashion waste by pushing for products that can be re-used in their entirety in some other format after their initial use ends — it's ultimately a collaborative effort between brands, city government and non-profits.

The campaign centers on a searchable map of the city that marks more than 1,100 places where clothing can be dropped off for resale or recycling, from clothing stores to thrift shops to recycling centers. Although it might seem simple, it's the first comprehensive map of its kind. Ads raising awareness about this resource for finding the nearest drop-off will be placed on bus stops and on LinkNYC boards across the city.

So far, retailers like Reformation, Athleta and H&M, secondhand sellers like ThredUp, textile experts like I:CO and Lenzing and city government organizations like DSNY and the Department of Sanitation have all signed on to support the initiative.

""By bringing together these brands, along with the City of New York and recyclers, we have an opportunity to ensure New Yorkers can find a new life for their clothing,"" Make Fashion Circular lead Francois Souchet said in a release. ""We believe clothes should never be trash.""

A representative for the Ellen MacArthur Foundation noted that the campaign intends to use social media and possibly local events to encourage New Yorkers to repair, resell or swap their old clothes, too, rather than jumping immediately to the idea of donating pieces they no longer wear — an important part of keeping clothing circulating as long as possible before it's repurposed for another use.

Beyond that, Souchet went on to say that ""customers alone cannot fix the fashion industry’s waste and pollution problems,"" a reminder that industry-wide collaboration is as necessary (if not more so) than consumer action.

In short, this campaign won't likely fix New York's fashion waste problem single-handedly. But as far as educating the average citizen about how to do better than simply throwing their unwanted apparel in the trash, it's an important step in the right direction.

699,Print your city? 3D printing is revolutionizing urban futures,"The Fabrication City concept puts manufacturing back in the hands of communities — using 3D printers. It could have far-reaching implications for economic development, environmental sustainability, inclusion and other benefits. The use of 3D printing provides cities with opportunities through their local innovators and entrepreneurs.

The process of 3D printing layers materials to create three-dimensional objects using digital equipment. Local makers are given access to fabrication labs equipped with technology to learn and this incubation environment can develop future entrepreneurs.

The fabrication city model emerged around 2011, developed by the MIT’s Centre for Bits and Atoms and by over 1,000 Maker Centres that give local makers access to 3D printing and other production tools. There are also neighbourhoods and city clusters that facilitate the maker movement.

There are opportunities for individuals and groups to create and market products from used or new materials using a digital device and additive technology. By facilitating these activities, cities can radically transform the way production and consumption happens within their region. Interconnecting people and processes to create local and regional inclusive innovation and economic growth while also reducing environmental impacts. What might we re-use if we practice more inclusive innovation and how might we change the local economy if we support local sourcing?

In our upcoming book, Innovative Solutions for Creating Sustainable Cities, the fabrication city section explains that going forward, we cannot follow the same principles as before by moving materials — or focus on the pursuit of efficiency (less investment of capital, energy, resources) for the maximization of outputs.

Read more: How to print a building: the science behind 3D printing in construction

Instead, we must radically redefine urbanism by changing how we produce, consume and live in cities so they can digest locally the waste they produce. Just as the digital economy is making platforms available for anyone to sell globally, new technologies such as additive manufacturing are allowing us to rethink where and how we make things.

The use of 3D printing is already transforming many conventional industries. For example, GE is able to replace a third of the parts on an aircraft engine using 3D printing and by fusing materials together they can reduce the overall number of parts. Honda created an electric vehicle entirely from 3D-printed segments. On-demand printed cars may be just around the corner. Even homes are being 3D printed at highly reasonable costs these days — although a bit rudimentary, the output can only get better.

This manufacturing revolution will have substantial implications, providing cities and local entrepreneurs with the opportunity to mass customize and produce for just-in-time delivery. It will reduce transportation and waste and thus help to minimize emissions. It may also reduce the overall cost for consumers while increasing local jobs.

Imagine cities equipped with flexible factories using local supply chains and locally sourced materials. These fabrication sites use waste materials, disassembled components and other sources to manufacture products digitally and customised for citizens. From prosthetic limbs to plastic waste used to create seating in city parks, to yes, a fridge, there are an increasing number of products being manufactured by local entrepreneurs.

Industrial manufacturing has begun this transition from degenerative to regenerative design (these are processes that restore and renew sources of energy and materials), also known as the circular economy. Waste, for example, is recirculated and fabricated to meet new needs such as energy production.

The fabrication city concept meets social, economic, governance and sustainable development goals. This is a tremendous incentive for cities to engage and establish new urban systems that are regenerative and restorative by design. The Fab City Global Initiative, begun in 2016, includes 27 participating municipalities and governments, among them Detroit, Amsterdam, Bhutan, Shenzhen, Ekurhuleni, Santiago de Chile, Boston and Paris.

There is a rich network of designers, makers and innovators from a wide range of sectors contributing to developments in consumer goods, energy, food production, health products and more. It is not hard to conceive that bulky products such as cars or fridges that are expensive to ship and warehouse could, in the future, be manufactured on demand locally.

Barcelona is perhaps the most easily recognized fabrication environment. Already, a significant amount of food, materials and products are no longer manufactured thousands of kilometres away — they are conceived, designed and grown within the urban boundaries.

Fabrication cities can differentiate themselves through design. They create a unique ecosystem that attracts innovative people and organisations, which allows cities to diversify and offer an unparalleled quality of life. Fabrication cities are a powerful game changer in the way that we make and dispose of everything we consume.

700,Consumerism in Southeast Asia,"Southeast Asia’s rapid urbanisation and increasing affluence has led to concerns about the growth of consumerism and its impact on sustainability. Consumerism is the constant purchasing of goods and services not termed as needs such as food, water, clothing and shelter and follows changing trends and fashion. Driving market forces, consumerism has become a way of life in many countries and is almost a hallmark of developed nations.

ASEAN’s rising economy, spending power and consumerism culture that has come with it has mirrored that which the United States (US), Europe and emerging markets such as China, India, Brazil and South Korea have experienced over the past few decades. However, it has taken an irreparable toll on the natural resources required to produce these goods and services. Increased demand for goods and services leads to an increase in production, which in turn leads to more pollution, plastic waste, deforestation and climate change. Consumerism can also contribute to potential health issues, and globally, there are two billion people who are either overweight or obese according to the United Nations (UN).

Should the global population reach 9.6 billion by 2050 as expected, the UN estimates that the equivalent of almost three planets could be required to provide the natural resources needed to sustain current lifestyles. Forum of the Future, an international sustainability non-profit, is optimistic about the economic growth, emerging start-up ecosystems and innovation in the region. However, Ariel Muller, Forum of the Future’s Managing Director for Asia Pacific, warns of the unintended consequences of unchecked consumerism in the region.

“Economic growth needs to be guided based on smart principles that will ensure the long-term well-being of the region and not just the short-term economic return,” Muller told The ASEAN Post. “When thinking about our economies, what should be at the forefront of our minds is what can we do to make sure humanity can thrive on planet Earth in years to come,” Muller added.

There are promising signs of a push-back against rampant consumerism and a deeper shift in mindsets around our consumption. Many millennials in the region are exploring new patterns of consumption and playing with the sharing economy, valuing quality over quantity, access over ownership, and experience over possession, noted Muller. New and disruptive business models in the sharing and circular economy, enabled by tech and logistical advances, are emerging in Asia – and many younger generation leaders are investing in more sustainable products and services.

Changing consumerism in Asia is one of seven critical issues which are expected to shape our 2020s and beyond as outlined in the Forum of the Future’s annual report released this week. Key to the Forum of the Future’s initiative to create a more sustainable future is its Circular Leap Asia project which aims to help companies provide consumers with products that are produced with no or minimal amount of waste, and therefore do not bear a hefty environmental price-tag.

Southeast Asia’s environmental woes – Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam are among the world’s worst plastic waste polluters – has risen in tandem with its economic growth and that of its middle class. The region’s gross domestic product (GDP) has more than quadrupled in the past two decades from US$577 billion in 1999 to US$2.8 trillion in 2017, and it is predicted ASEAN will be the world’s fourth largest economy by 2030 after the US, China, and the European Union (EU).

Led by a growing educated and young workforce, ASEAN’s middle class is estimated to be two-thirds of its overall population by 2030, a huge jump from the 29 percent in 2010. Consulting firm McKinsey expects the number of middle-class households in ASEAN to reach 120 million by 2025, roughly double the number in 2010. Meanwhile, HSBC forecasts that per-capita GDP across the 10-member ASEAN bloc will experience a threefold increase from about US$3,000 in 2010 to more than US$9,000 in 2030.

With sustainable consumption and production as one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set out by the UN, greater awareness of the negative effect consumerism has on the environment will go a long way in changing consumption patterns – especially with the next generation of consumers. Children need to be taught the value of their consumption decisions and how these decisions will affect their communities, countries, the region and the world.

701,The beautiful thing that happened when this Japanese town went (almost) waste-free,"Yes, the town of Kamikatsu, which is on the Western Japanese island of Shikoku, is small — just under 1,600 people. But an experiment in going zero waste has shown the world that our garbage has far-reaching effects, and not just on our environment.

It all started when the town, which is surrounded by rice fields and forests, built a new incinerator almost 20 years ago. But almost immediately, the incinerator was determined to be a health risk due to the number of dioxins it released into the air when garbage was burned in it. It was too expensive to send waste to other towns, so locals had to come up with a new plan.

From this conundrum, the Zero Waste Academy was born. According to their website, ""The Zero Waste Academy provides services to change: the perspectives & actions of people; ownership and usage of things; and social systems, to turn waste into valuables.""

Now Kamikatsu residents separate their waste into 45 different categories, including the basics like paper, plastics, metal, glass, furniture and food waste — but then there are many subcategories too. Paper gets sorted out into newspaper, cardboard, coated paper cartons, shredded paper and more. Metals get separated by type.

""By doing this level of segregation, we can actually turn it over to the recycler knowing that they will treat it as a high-quality resource,"" Akira Sakano, the founder of Zero Waste Academy, told World Ecoomic Forum.

In the beginning, it wasn't easy to convince local residents to do all this work, and there was some pushback. Communication was the key to changing minds; they held classes and ran an information campaign. ""While there was still a bit of conflict, part of the community started to understand the context and cooperate, so the municipal office decided to start the segregated collection system. Once the residents saw that it had started, they realized that it wasn't that difficult,"" Sakano said. After that initial education period, most residents came on board. Many now separate their waste into general categories at home, and then do a more refined segregation at the station.



This is all great news for waste reduction of course (the town hasn't quite gotten to their goal of zero-waste yet, but aims to by 2020), but it has also had some unexpected social benefits as well. Like much of Japan, Kamikatsu's population is aging, and about 50 percent of the locals are elderly. The fact that the whole community takes their trash in to be recycled has created a hub of local action and interaction between generations.

That idea has been purposefully expanded to include a circular shop where household goods are dropped off and others can take them, and a tableware ""library"" where people can borrow extra cups, glasses, silverware and plates for celebrations (eliminating the need for single-use disposables). A craft center takes in old fabrics and sewing supplies — including old kimonos — and locals make new items from them.

""[The elderly] see this not as a waste-collection service, but an opportunity to socialize with the younger generation and to chat. When we visit them, they prepare lots of food and we stay with them for a while, we ask how they are,"" Sakano told the World Economic Forum.

Sakano wants to see her community's dual success — reducing waste and creating community — expanded elsewhere.

She says that people being more involved with their waste, seeing where it goes and understanding what happens to it, is key to changing how we all consume. The Zero Waste Center reports on how much has been recycled, where it goes and what it's made into.

Part of changing people's relationship to consumable stuff also includes educating locals into not buying products that aren't recyclable. Sakano says the only thing standing in the way of 100 percent zero waste for her town is the fact that some manufacturers still use non-recyclable packaging and materials in their products.

Sakano says, ""Products need to be designed for the circular economy, where everything is reused or recycled. These actions really need to be taken to businesses and incorporate producers, who need to consider how to deal with the product once its useful life has ended.""

Sakano's ideas are truly revolutionary if you think about it. She's proving that community can be found through handling the stuff we no longer want and need. If shopping can be a relationship-building activity (which it's certainly advertised as being), why not the results of the shopping too?

702,Samsung goes green with sustainable gadget packing,"In support of environmental conservation, Korean technology giant Samsung will be replacing plastic packaging materials for its products, presently deemed ‘non-recyclable’, with paper and other environmentally sustainable materials. The company has also increased the usage of non-conventional energy sources by going solar at its R&D centre in Bengaluru.

From the first half of 2019, the packaging used currently for Samsung’s products and accessories—ranging from mobile phones and tablets to home appliances—will be substituted with environmentally sustainable materials like recycled/bio-based plastics and paper. To revamp product packaging, Samsung Electronics has formed a taskforce involving design and development, purchasing, marketing and quality control for innovative packaging ideas.

“Samsung Electronics is stepping up in addressing society’s environmental issues such as resource depletion and plastic wastes,” said Gyeong-bin Jeon, head of Samsung’s Global Customer Satisfaction Centre. “We are committed to recycling resources and minimising pollution coming from our products. We will adopt more environmentally sustainable materials even if it means an increase in cost.”

For mobile phone, tablet and wearable products, Samsung will replace the plastic used for holder trays with pulp molds, and bags wrapping accessories with eco-friendly materials. Samsung will also alter the phone charger design, swapping the glossy exterior with a matte finish and eliminating plastic protection films, reducing the use of plastics. The plastic bags used to protect the surface of home appliances such as TVs, refrigerators, air conditioners and washing machines as well as other kitchen appliances will also be replaced with bags containing recycled materials and bio-plastics, which are respectively made from plastic wastes and non-fossil fuel materials such as starch or sugar cane.

Regarding paper, Samsung will only use fibre materials certified by global environmental organisations like the Forest Stewardship Council, Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification Scheme and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative for packaging and manuals by 2020. Under the company’s circular economy policy, Samsung Electronics has set a mid-term implementation plan to only use paper packaging materials certified by forestry initiatives by next year. By 2030, Samsung aims to use 500,000 tonne of recycled plastics and collect 7.5 million tonne of discarded products (both cumulative from 2009).

Earlier this year, Samsung’s largest R&D centre outside Korea, switched to solar power for its campus in Bengaluru which houses over 3,000 R&D employees. Initiated in March 2016 as part of its ‘Go Green Initiative’ to increase usage of green energy sources, the company now draws 88% of its power requirement from a solar farm in Kalburgi district in Karnataka, around 500 km away from Bengaluru, thus cutting down reliance on the traditional power grid, making that energy available for other uses.

Samsung R&D Institute – Bangalore (SRI-B) has drawn 8 lakh units of solar power since December 2018 that replaces energy derived from traditional sources such as coal. The solar farm generates/adds the required power to the state electricity grid and SRI-B through ‘energy wheeling’ receives an equal amount of power from the local electricity grid. This process/method helps in curbing transmission and distribution losses. “The resolution to Go Green has not only become a part of our company’s corporate social responsibility, but a mission to reduce the global carbon footprint by embedding initiatives within the organisation that supports the same. There are many other environmental

oncerns and we seek to implement more innovative methods of promoting an eco-friendly environment for future

generations,” said Dipesh Shah, managing director, SRI-B.",United States,2019.03
703,TTE News: Environmental Achievement of the Year,"Tire Technology International Awards for Innovation and Excellence 2019 shortlist – as supplied by organisers UKI Media & Events. Winners to be announced at gala dinner event on 6 March

Every year over 1 billion end-of-life tires are either sent to landfill or incinerated. Lehigh Technologies and Michelin are addressing the problem of waste tires by upcycling them into a high-performance, raw material called micronized rubber powder (MRP), reducing the industry’s reliance on finite natural resources while improving the performance of market-ready products without any compromise. After last year’s acquisition of the specialty chemicals company, Michelin is actively working to strengthen its commitment to its 4R Strategy of reducing, reusing, recycling and renewing materials in its product line. Michelin recently announced its sustainability goals of recycling 100% of its tires and using 80% sustainable materials in the manufacture of new tires by 2048.

RubberJet Valley’s solution allows for the recycling of truck and OTR end-of-life tires (ELT) that are not efficiently treatable by traditional shredding plants which use mechanical cutting technology. RubberJet Valley’s HPWJ Technology is able to recycle truck and OTR tires, whatever the size, obtaining clean, unique secondary raw materials – powder (RJPTM) and granules (RJGTM) which feature high NR content, high levels of purity, and are already partially devulcanized. RJPTM and RJGTM can be inserted in the compounds of new tires, contributing to a circular economy for OTR tires.

World’s first polymer to bond rubber and resins at a molecular level. Crack resistance five times higher than natural rubber, tensile strength and abrasion resistance also higher than NR. It’s a hybrid material to bond synthetic rubber components and resins. In theory, could lead to 50% reduction in the amount of materials used in the tire (less tread depth, less polymer needed in production) and could also (potentially) reduce rolling resistance without affecting durability – making it a big factor in future EV tire development.

Yokohama has developed what is claimed to be the world’s first technology capable of efficiently producing isoprene from biomass. The breakthrough was achieved through joint research with Riken and Zeon Corp. Isoprene is a raw material used in the production of synthetic rubber (polyisoprene rubber) applied in tires and other applications. Industrial isoprene is currently produced as a by-product of naphtha pyrolysis. The development of this new technology for synthesizing isoprene will reduce dependence on petroleum and contribute to the reduction of CO in the environment.

RF latex has long been used as an adhesive to bond textiles with the rubber, but the chemicals are under increasing scrutiny for their environmental impact. They could be reclassified, or even banned, in the future. Michelin has spent nine years (and 35 patents) researching and developing replacement chemicals. It also necessitated development of a new processing method (using powder instead of liquid ingredients).",United States,2019.03

According to a news release issued by Aqua Metals, Veolia will contribute its operational and technological expertise and organizational capabilities in aqueous-based process chemistries and electrolysis. The company also will assume responsibility for operations, supply chain, offtake and management of the plant.

Veolia employees will begin working on-site at the McCarran plant starting March 4 with the goal of bringing plant operations to 16 modules of AquaRefining capacity by the end of 2019. Aqua Metals says additional rate increases are planned for 2020.

This partnership will expand VNA’s Regeneration Services business, which operates seven sites in North America.

“Veolia’s size and technical regeneration capabilities will provide valuable and additive expertise as we execute our business plan,” says Steve Cotton, president CEO of Aqua Metals. “We chose to partner with Veolia for its well-deserved reputation as a global leader in operations management and its commitment to sustainability and the circular economy business model.

“Having Veolia manage operations at the McCarran plant facilitates our transition to the next phase of our business strategy, which is to become a capital-light technology licensing organization that expands AquaRefining technology into battery recycling centers across the globe,” he continues. “Licensing AquaRefining technology will enable battery recycling facilities to increase production to meet rising demand without increasing environmental impact. Recycling facilities will also gain the added value of producing a higher quality product with promising advantages for improving battery performance and lifecycle.

709,Only a third of Australia's plastic packaging waste gets recycled,"Only a third of Australia’s plastic packaging waste ends up being recycled, according to a new report.

The study, conducted by the University of Technology Sydney and commissioned by the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation (APCO), tracked different kinds of packaging waste in the 2017-18 financial year.

It estimated that only 56% of all packaging waste in Australia was recovered and recycled. Of that, 72% of paper packaging was recycled, but only 32% of plastics.

All figures in the report were estimates, with a margin of error that varied from 3% to 17%.

According to the report, an estimated 72% of aluminium was recycled, and 54% of metal generally.

This means more than 600,000 tonnes of plastic packaging – out of 900,000 tonnes used – was not recycled last year. PET, HDPE and PVC plastic had even lower recycling rates at below 30%.

The report also said Australia exported a high percentage of its waste to other countries to recycle, instead of processing it domestically.

The APCO chief executive, Brooke Donnelly, said Australia needed to boost its domestic recycling industry and create a “circular economy” – where manufactured goods were consumed, reused and recycled.

“Of all packaging that is collected for recycling, 19% is getting exported,” she said. “That’s a significant portion.

“The general consensus, from both government and industry, is to move towards the circular economy. It is conceptually a wonderful thing but is very difficult to translate that into operation.

“We’re really good at collecting it and sorting it, let’s find more ways to reprocess it here and find domestic solutions.”

Last year, a Senate inquiry into recycling heard that Australia’s domestic recycling industry was “immature” – according to a joint submission from 10 local councils.

This week’s report recommended that the low plastic recycling rate could be improved with better separation (both at the kerbside level and beyond), superior sorting technology and increased manual sorting.

Donnelly said manufacturers also had to do more to make sure their products and packaging were easily recyclable.

“It’s a little bit of everything. We need to educate consumers better about what bin you are putting your packaging waste in, there needs to be investment in better technology in the recovery stage. And there needs to be work around brands and manufacturers designing packaging around the end of life of their product.”

She said manufacturers needed to make packages so they were more recyclable, such as having clear labelling about how it could be recycled, or using less plastic entirely.

According to the report, Australians created 2m tonnes of paper waste, and recycled 1.5m tonnes. Overall, 4.5m tonnes of packaging waste were produced last year, and 2.5m tonnes were recycled.

Donnelly said there were still some data gaps in the recycling statistics, and that in future years the industry and researchers should work on getting further information and better data.

“Nigeria needs to go into aggressive reforestation nationwide, beginning from grassroots to federal levels, so as to address poor vegetation cover that is already threatening extinct species and biodiversity,’’ he said.

The ecologist also urged Buhari to prioritise low and zero carbon emitting industrial and transport systems, as well as energy for domestic use.

“Buhari’s administration ought to be watchful about water and sanitation need sat grassroots, which over time have become issues of crucial importance and national concern.

“If the new administration of President Muhammadu Buhari is able to prioritise low carbon initiatives and green growth, it will be winning the wrestling against climate change.

“It will also leave behind the highest ecological legacy for the next generation,’’ he said.

The executive director, who expressed delight over the re-election of Buhari, described his victory at the polls as well deserved.

“May God continue to give him the wisdom and strength to lead and conduct the affairs of our great nation in such a dignified and honourable manner that will take us to the next level.

“We sincerely appreciate the president for his previous commitments towards fighting climate change, environmental degradation and resource depletion.

“This was done through various specialised Ministries, Departments and Agencies of government,’’ he said.

Inyamkume also commended the president’s outstanding roles in collaborating with international institutions and governments towards achieving possible climate change reversal, globally.

“As an ecologist and climate advocate, my main concern is how Nigeria will improve on climate change response approach or strategy that will better serve adaptation needs of its teeming population of over 170 million citizens.

“These people are directly or indirectly at risk of extermination if adequate and prompt care is not taken,’’ he said.

 According to him, at the moment, a substantial number of Nigerians have been adversely impacted by climate change mostly women and children.

“With my experience in the northeast region, particularly around the Lake Chad Basin, the magnitude of climate impact on people is intense and exposure is likely to increase in the coming years if nothing is done to support community and individual adaptation capacity.

“It becomes imperative that the new administration of President Muhammadu Buhari will continue working to ensure that critical environmental concerns are addressed with utmost seriousness.

716,Corrugated Packaging Market is likely to progress at a promising CAGR of 5.8% over 2018-2026 – Digital Day News,"“The global corrugated packaging market will be primarily driven by material & design innovation. Food & beverages are likely to register the highest demand, whereas Ecommerce sector has been spotted as the market growth catalyst,” quotes a research analyst (Persistence Market Research).

Corrugated packaging is made up of nearly 88% recycled content that is further accompanied by additional fresh fibers, making it a sustainable packaging solution. While corrugated packaging is considered to make the optimum use of secondary raw materials, packaging manufacturers and end-use industries are adopting it as a sustainable packaging solution since the recent past. Persistence Market Research (PMR) delivers key insights on the global corrugated packaging market in its recently published report, which indicates that the market is likely to progress at a promising CAGR of 5.8% over 2018-2026. While robust growth of food and beverages industry has been a primary driver to market growth, rapidly thriving Ecommerce business is identified to be a significantly influencing factor driving the growth of market through projection period.

Rapidly growing popularity and sales of processed/convenience foods and beverages, especially in emerging economies, will reportedly strengthen the position of Asia Pacific as the largest market for corrugated packaging. While APAC is expected to contribute the maximum revenue share to the total market value by this year end, research concludes that Europe, North America, and Latin America may collectively account for a considerably large share of more than 50% in the global corrugated packaging market revenue in near future.

Recyclability and biodegradability of corrugated packaging enables it to contribute to a circular economy, which has been driving innovation in the packaging industry. Paper Industries and corrugated packaging industries have also been innovating with novel alternatives such as fossil-based products in order to mitigate for the consumer and environmental demands. Corrugated packaging design introduced for bottled drinks that are available for purchase only online, has also been a recent, impactful innovation in the industry. Six-pack of cans registered immense popularity among consumers owing to an ergonomic and sturdy hold they offer. On the flipside, popularity among manufacturers is attributed to the ample space these cans offer for labelling and advertising.

725,How The New Plastic Waste Asset Class Can Help Solve Ocean Pollution,"Ocean plastic costs. It costs the earth and it costs us money. In economic terms, plastic does $13 billion in damage to marine ecosystems annually. As much as 95% of the value of plastic packaging -- worth $80 to $120 billion annually -- is lost to the economy after the first-use cycle. It’s a massive problem.

In the past, short-term solutions have targeted symptoms rather than the cause. Efforts to raise consumer awareness of single use plastics like straws, while hugely effective in raising awareness and becoming part of the popular zeitgeist, do little to address the enormity of the ocean plastic problem -- as, fortunately, these kinds of single use plastics represent less than 1% of ocean plastic.

Ocean plastic is a systems problem that demands a comprehensive, systems solution. Of the estimated trillions of development finance dollars spent annually, in 2012, less than .5% of it went to solid waste management. So how do we solve the problem -- and where will we get the resources to do it?

There are no silver bullets. To turn plastic waste into a resource, we need to engage a suite of solutions: from public policy and corporate commitments to financial incentives and changes in human behavior.

However, we know where to start: India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and The Philippines. Studies show that a 45% global reduction in plastic leakage to the ocean can be achieved by improving waste management and recycling in these five countries.

Especially in South and Southeast Asia, the challenge is that those working on the problem -- from waste collection, to aggregation, to recycling -- lack funding and scale. Potential investors are wary of the sector as they don’t have the evidence-based track records, pipeline of investable opportunities and intermediated investment products necessary to build confidence and unlock large-scale capital.

At each stage of a company's growth, different forms of capital are necessary for the type of expansion that can enable systemic conversion of waste into value. But, there are critical financing gaps -- from philanthropic and human capital to seed capital and mezzanine debt -- that must be filled to create ecosystems of innovation, investment, entrepreneurship and public-private partnerships.

The Emergence of A New Plastic Waste Asset Class

Infusions of investment from the capital markets is critical if we want to scale lasting solutions. And, the only way capital markets will act at scale is if investors have the confidence that this is a money-making opportunity. Otherwise, it will languish in subscale experiments and pilot purgatory. By financing scalable and replicable solutions from local innovators who are implementing on the front lines of plastic pollution, and by incentivizing a new generation of social entrepreneurs to build a fresh pipeline of potential projects, the problem of ocean plastic can be turned into a massive opportunity.

The good news is that -- thanks to the awareness building of vanguard organizations such as Ocean Conservancy and awareness built by anti-straw campaigns -- funds are beginning to flow from investors eager to deploy into solutions that provide financial returns as well as a positive environmental impact. Unfortunately, while these players are few and far between across Southeast Asia, we can look to India, which has a richer history of venture investing, for signals of what is possible for investors.

Starting in 2013, Aavishkaar, an early-stage venture capital provider, began investing and cultivating in the Ahmedabad-based waste processing firm Nepra Resource Management Pvt. Ltd, which operates under the ‘Let’s Recycle’ brand. And, last year, they made an $6.5 million follow-on investment alongside Asha Impact, the proceeds of which will be used to fund Nepra’s expansion to three new cities.

At the other end of the spectrum, in August 2018, in a significant development for the solid waste management (SWM) sector, private equity investor KKR announced that it acquired a 60% interest in Hyderabad-based Ramky Enviro Engineers Ltd (REEL) for $530 million. REEL, which had a turnover of $260 million in the year to March 2018, operates in environment management services include collection, transport and processing of hazardous, municipal, biomedical and e-waste, as well as recycling of paper, plastic and chemicals. The transaction is the largest ever in the Indian SWM space.

These are just some of the new, investible solutions from emerging entrepreneurs that are catching favor with an institutional investor class, and the kinds of initiatives that will be necessary to scale lasting solutions. Smart investors are paying attention to these ""bright spot"" examples and others as they decide whether to join in. But, there is a wide gap in the scale between these two transactions and they just aren't common enough -- especially in smaller countries across Southeast Asia.

More risk-tolerant capital is needed to incubate and invest in the companies and infrastructure projects that will become the future of waste and recycling across the region.

Corporate investors are uniquely positioned to meet that need because don't need the same financial returns of a KKR or Aavishkaar and they get their value from a functioning supply chain that can deliver recycled material for their supply chains. In October, my firm announced an investment strategy with investors that include global companies like PepsiCo, The Coca-Cola Company, Danone, Dow, Procter & Gamble, and Unilever, which expect to commit more than $100m to incubate and invest in solutions in South and Southeast Asia. The goal is to unlock billions of dollars from public and private institutional investors and demonstrate that investment in ocean plastic solutions will provide financial returns.

It won’t be easy. It demands the creation and realignment of the entire ecosystem that generates and remediates ocean plastic pollution -- developing a circular economy that takes old plastic and turns it into a new, reusable resource for future materials. But the process will turn ocean plastic from a problem into an economic and development opportunity for emerging markets around the world. Going forward, I plan to write on the growing role of institutional investors who are teaming up with entrepreneurs that are tackling innovations and some of our biggest environmental challenges.",United States,2019.03
727,"The Future of Sustainable Barrier Films Is Clear: BOBST’s Transparent, High Barrier SiOx Solution Is Both Robust and Environmentally Friendly","In a world where the environmental pressure and circular economy are major priorities for brand owners and challenges for converters, BOBST provides the proven solution with PECVD SiOx.

The BOBST PECVD SiOx Solution produces high barrier film with a high degree of transparency which is both retortable and microwavable. SiOx coated substrates present less problems during the conversion process than other transparent barrier films, as well as being recyclable and FDA approved making them an ideal choice for converters looking to contribute to a circular economy.

BOBST PECVD Process

The PECVD process used to produce the SiOx coated film is cost effective and commercialised by BOBST, as well as being operator independent allowing for production of consistent high quality film. The process incorporates the use of a silicon based monomer (HMDSO) which is deposited on to the substrate within a low temperature plasma environment. The monomer and process gasses (He, O2 and Ar) are introduced into the vacuum chamber via a form of gas bar; the gas bar ensures even process gas distribution across the width of the machine and therefore a uniform coating of SiOx .

Films created during the PECVD process are very thin and in order to achieve good barrier levels the quality of the coating needs to be optimized. As a result of the AC power supply there is a physical bombardment of ions and electrons towards the process drum which creates densification of Silicon Oxide on to the film providing more of a resistance to oxygen and water permeation.

The temperatures used throughout the process are low which makes the process ideal for heat sensitive and thin gauge substrates such as BOPP and CPP.

Excellent Oxygen and Water Barrier

The SiOx coated film has excellent oxygen and water barrier levels of around 2cc/m2/day (OTR) and around 2gm/m2/day (WVTR) on PET and retains high levels even when subjected to a Stretch-durability test; the film can handle a high level of strain and stretch maintaining barrier at strain levels of <4%. The flex durability of the film as measured by the aggressive Gelbo test can be seen in the two graphs below.

The results of these tests show that the SiOx coating can withstand the various stresses and strains during conversion processes without there being a significant deterioration in barrier levels making it the most flexible and forgiving inorganic transparent barrier film.

High Adhesion for Retort Applications

The BOBST SiOx process has excellent adhesion properties for both dry and wet applications, adhesion values of >4N/15mm can be achieved. The excellent adhesion properties mean the coating is successfully used in many retort applications in the market.",United States,2019.03

729,"Chaffee Green forum discusses recycling, other environmental issues","Chaffee Green held a speaker’s forum Feb. 20, bringing together representatives from green groups throughout the state to talk about a wide range of environmentally conscious subjects.

First, the Greater Arkansas River Nature Association formally announced the incorporation of Chaffee Green as a program of the organization.

“We’re here to be a support platform to allow Chaffee Green to do what it’s doing, what it’s already doing, but to provide the organizational infrastructure, the 501-c(3) to allow it to thrive,” said GARNA executive director Dominique Naccarato.

Alan Robinson of Friends of Fourmile, another group that is associated with GARNA, said that “over the years it’s become kind of an automatic gesture among all of our members” to become members of the umbrella organization. “We are comforted by the fact that we feel we are part of a larger organization.”

Kim Marquis next spoke about Envision Chaffee County’s coming activities in 2019.

Included is the Chaffee County Wildfire Survey, administered by Envision and partners in the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, the Colorado State Forest Service, local fire districts and the Chaffee County Office of Emergency Management.

“We know it’s a concern, but we want to know are you worried about smoke? Do you have an evacuation plan?” Marquis asked.

The first public meetings on the results of the survey will be held sometime this summer, she said.

“The wildfire protection plan would essentially inform the county as to the priorities which would be considered by the Common Ground board,” Robinson added.

The seven-person Common Ground board, whose membership is being decided upon now, is the group tasked with administering grants funded by the 0.25 percent sales tax hike approved by voters in November under Ballot Issue 1A.

Another project Envision is embarking on is to create an atlas of the county’s recreation resources.

The atlas, which could be accessed through a phone app that will ideally be available by this summer, would “not only map our trails, where our toilets are, where to park, all that stuff … but other aspects like where are our wildlife corridors, where are our rural assets,” Marquis said. “Lots of different things are going into this map.”

The territory of mapping usage impacts is far from uncharted in Chaffee County – Friends of Fourmile has been doing it for decades – and Robinson said that his group’s data would be shared with Envision’s system.

Next, Wano Urbonas, the county’s environmental health specialist, spoke about BV Blue Sky and a nascent project to monitor air quality in the county.

Currently, Urbonas has one Purple Air monitor installed in Salida to monitor the amount of particulates in the air in units of micrograms per cubic liter.

Urbonas said he’s looking for homes for two more monitors, with the ultimate hope being to have monitors in the north, south, east and west.

The monitors can tell us what’s in the air we breathe and how much of it is there, but they won’t tell us what is contributing to that pollution, Urbonas said, but the data provides a base for a larger study.

The topic then turned to recycling for the remainder of the meeting, beginning with Beth Lenz of the Upper Arkansas Area Council of Governments.

Behind the unwieldy acronym, UAACOG is an umbrella group whose primary utility to local groups is its ability to “tie resources together,” Lenz said.

In 2015, UAACOG conducted a trash audit of its four member counties. The report generated from that audit determined that 53 percent of trash being sent to the landfill could have been diverted, including 41 percent traditional recyclables, 12 percent hazardous waste like film plastics, paint, textiles, batteries and materials banned from landfill disposal like motor vehicle and electronic wastes.

Chaffee County was the star of the area in terms of its waste diversion rates, increasing from 8 percent in 2005 to 16 percent in 2016.

For 2015, the study calculated the average amount of waste generation per person per day in Chaffee at 5.1 pounds and 3.1 in Lake. In 2016, the study increased those numbers to 8.42 pounds per person in Chaffee and 4.69 pounds per person in Lake.

The U.S. average in 4.41.

Next, Recycle Colorado executive director Laurie Johnson discussed the economic side of recycling.

Johnson’s group works at the state level to improve the infrastructure of collecting and processing recyclable materials and finding end markets for those materials.

“You can collect and process things and bale them and store them all day long, but if you don’t have someone to buy it, you’re done,” Johnson said.

The ideal in recycling is a circular economy, where a product can be disposed of and taken to a facility that can turn its raw materials into that same product all over again. All the better if it stays within a state.

Through Miller-Coors, a circular economy for glass bottles exists in Colorado.

Johnson said Recycle Colorado is working to bring a facility to the Front Range that would turn certain types of plastics into diesel fuel.

Specifically, the facility would use plastics with resin numbers – the number embossed on the surface of some plastics that roughly indicates the type of material it’s made of – 3 through 7. Problematic plastic types in that Chaffee County’s recycling service, Angel of Shavano, like many recyclers around the county, have stopped accepting them.

Angel of Shavano owner-operator Mickey Barry next spoke about changes to the recycling facility that would hopefully make the service easier to use.

The only type of plastic the facility is now taking are twist-top bottles, lids removed. These are made of plastic numbers 1 and 2, PET and HDPE. But for the sake of simplicity, Barry is doing away with the numbers and focusing on signage that uses pictures rather than words.

Quickly wrapping up the meeting were Julie Mach, the owner of Elements Mountain Composting, and Trish Cullinan, who employs worms to help dispose of organic waste in her home.

Mach contracts with businesses for curbside pickup of compostable waste – anything but dairy – and then sells the soil she produces through the biological composting process, where bacteria can cause piles of waste to heat up to 140 degrees.",United States,2019.03
734,Pepsi making a switch from bottled to canned water to reduce plastic waste,"(WTHR) – PepsiCo is taking a step to reduce plastic waste in landfills.

The beverage company announced they will be making a switch from bottled water to canned water.

Pepsi says that ""LIFEWTR"" will be packaged in 100% rPET (recycled polyethylene terephthalate) and ""bubly"" will no longer be packaged in plastic.

Soon the company's brand ""AQUAFINA"" will offer aluminum can packaging in U.S. food service outlets, while the brand tests the move in retail.

“As one of the world’s leading food and beverage companies, we recognize the significant role PepsiCo can play in helping to change the way society makes, uses, and disposes of plastics,” said PepsiCo Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta, in a statement. “We are doing our part to address the issue head on by reducing, recycling and reinventing our packaging to make it more sustainable, and we won’t stop until we live in a world where plastics are renewed and reused.”

The changes will go into effect next year and are expected to eliminate more than 8,000 metric tons of plastic and about 11,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions.",United States,2019.06

738,Adding value to a third innings,"Good governance, clean nature, a silent people, midnight sun, frosty winters, heavy metal and saunas are some of the features commonly associated with Finland and Finns. As Finland’s Presidency of the Council of the European Union (EU) begins from July 1, the country has an opportunity to bring forth and present the values it believes in. Openness, transparency and equality are not just words for Finns; they are in Finland’s DNA.

Seeing these values increasingly emerge in cooperation between India and the European Union is great news. Finland wants to strengthen the EU as a global actor and sees India as a key partner in tackling global challenges. India and the EU share the same values of democracy, tolerance and a strong rules-based international order.

The union was formed to ensure peace and prosperity in Europe after the Second World War. It began as purely economic cooperation between the six founding member states. Today the EU is an organisation with common laws and regulations which span policy areas from climate, environment and health issues to external relations, justice and migration.

This is Finland’s third engagement with the EU Council Presidency. In 1999, its slogan was ‘Europe into the new Millennium’. In 2006 the integration of 10 new EU member states was a cross-cutting theme. The Presidency rotates between the member states, and the Finnish Presidency is preceded by the Romanian Presidency and succeeded by the Croatian Presidency. The three countries form a troika, agreeing on certain principles together. While the Lisbon Treaty (2009) reduced the role of the Presidency, it is still important in trade, development cooperation, enlargement, legal and consular affairs. The task of the Presidency is to bring forward the EU agenda.

Sustainability runs through the identity of Finland’s Presidency. Delegates attending meetings in Helsinki will be served organic, and locally produced Finnish food; the emphasis will be on vegetarian fare, with the use of plastic reduced. Finland wants to lay stress on the importance of a circular economy by replacing the use of paper and plastic material with digital applications and Finnish innovations. During Finland’s six-month tenure, there will be six informal ministerial meetings in the country.

The implementation of the EU-India Strategy is close to Finland’s heart. The EU Council adopted the strategy in November 2018. As an ambitious document, it spells out clear priorities to develop further already excellent EU-India relations in sectors such as trade, terrorism, defence, science and global affairs. In New Delhi, the EU delegation and member states will implement the strategy together. It goes without saying that Finland hopes for a breakthrough in free trade negotiations and a resumption of the dialogue on human rights.

The EU is complex by nature. The responsibilities of the EU institutions and the member states need to be explained repeatedly and this applies to Finland and India. However, for Finns it is easy to speak about the EU in positive terms. Finland’s membership is a value-based choice because it has anchored the country permanently to the West. The support for the EU is at a record high in Finland. Its currency is the Euro. Further, most Finns consider themselves both Finnish and European. The EU is a unique economic and political union that binds 28 countries together.

After the European parliamentary elections that were held in May 2019 in all 28 countries, a new leadership and a new Commission will be appointed. In addition, there will be challenging issues brought to the table during the six months Finland holds the Council Presidency. These include the multi-annual budget, migration and Brexit, the process of the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU. Finland wants to deepen security cooperation in the EU. If at the end of December, Finland has contributed to this agenda having been brought forward, then there will be reason to be content.

743,Dutch dairy tries to promote animal welfare and combat pollution with urban farming,"Peter van Wingerden’s dairy farm smells just like any other farm — the rich aroma of cow manure and grass hangs in the air around the unusual stable housing the cattle. The farm itself is far from traditional.

Moored in a small harbor in Rotterdam’s busy port, the farm is a futuristic three-story floating structure where one robot milks the cows and another automatically scoops up the manure that gives the enterprise its familiar smell.

Its roof collects rainwater and a raft of solar panels floating alongside produces 40% of the energy the farm needs.

The cows, gazing out over ships transporting gas and yellow cranes unloading ships, eat a mixture of grass cut from a local golf course and the field used by Rotterdam’s top soccer team, grain used by a local brewer to make beer, and potato peelings — all automatically cut, mixed and transported to food troughs by conveyor belts.

As countries around the world seek to meet the challenge of feeding growing populations in a sustainable way, Van Wingerden believes the farm, which opened in May and cost about $3.4 million, demonstrates a new sustainable way of producing food close to where most of it is consumed — in the world’s cities.

“Transporting all this food all over the world is really polluting the world. It’s doing damage to food quality, it creates food losses,” he said in a recent interview. “So we have to find a different model. We have to bring it much closer to the citizens. And that’s what we’re showing over here.”

The fully functioning showcase of circular-economy farming combines Dutch expertise in recycling, building on water and automated agriculture is drawing interest from around the world. Van Wingerden said he is already discussing floating farms in Singapore and China. A group is looking into locating one in Red Hook, Brooklyn. N.Y.

“We should stop exporting food, but we should start exporting knowledge and technology,” Van Wingerden said.

When the herd reaches its target capacity of 40 cows — there are currently 35 — it will produce 211 gallons of milk each day. The brown and white cows are a breed called Maas-Rijn-Ijssel — named for three rivers that flow through the Dutch region they originate from.

The farm pasteurizes the milk and turns some of it into yogurt on the middle floor of the pontoon. Manure is processed for use as fertilizer.

Jan Willem van der Schans, a senior researcher at Wageningen Economic Research who specializes in urban farming and circular economy issues, said floating farms could be the future for some sectors of agriculture such as fruit and some vegetables in some parts of the world. But he thinks that the level of automation and the unnatural surroundings of the cows may create opposition to the project.

“These are animals that we all like, and then, we like to see them in a meadow,” he said. “And then, we bring them into a very industrial environment, and I think that’s something that many people think is not the right direction for livestock farming to go into.”

Van Wingerden said that animal welfare is his top priority, pointing to many design elements in the construction that are intended to make life as easy as possible for the cows such as rubber floors and poles in the stable. A small meadow of grass speckled with wildflowers grows on land next to the pontoon. Once fencing is completed, cows will be free to walk down to graze in more natural surroundings.

“Animal welfare is for us design criteria No. 1,” he said. “We wanted to create the best stable — comfortable stable, solid stable — for the cows, and that’s what we did.”

The cows appear comfortable on the water. On a recent hot, sunny, day some lay in the shade, others stood, eating from the food troughs that overlook the busy Merwe Harbor, while others milled around the milking robot.

The pontoon rose and fell gently on undercurrents caused by the movement of nearby ships.

The movement didn’t appear to affect the cows.

“The cows are on four feet, so that helps a lot,” Van Wingerden said. “So they have not got any problem at all. They don’t get seasick. They don’t get seasick at all.”",United States,2019.06

The American Chemistry Council issued the following response, which may be attributed to Steve Russell, vice president of ACC’s Plastics Division: 



“America’s plastic makers welcome the G20’s Osaka Blue Ocean Vision to end plastic leakage into the ocean, and we applaud Japan’s leadership in addressing this important issue. We look forward to working with G20 countries to help make this vision a reality.

“Eliminating ocean plastics will require innovations in products, systems and technologies; global deployment of waste management infrastructure, particularly in areas where the most leakage is occurring; and strong public-private partnerships. Plastics makers are helping to promote advancements in each of these areas.

“Plastic waste is an urgent problem, and importantly, it’s one that can be solved with ongoing cooperation, innovation, and investment.

“Plastics offer numerous environmental benefits, such as helping to conserve resources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Lightweight, efficient plastics can help the world’s growing population live more sustainably—but we need to do a better job of capturing and repurposing used plastics, to create a more circular economy, while continuing to meet society’s needs.

“Many of America’s plastic makers are among the founders of and contributors to the , a new nonprofit with a goal of deploying $1.5 billion to help develop the systems, knowledge, and infrastructure needed to collect and repurpose waste, including in regions where most environmental leakage occurs. Other key members of the Alliance include brand owners, plastic processors, and recyclers.”

747,Amazon is missing a giant opportunity and it leaves the door wide open for someone else to steal a chunk of the market (AMZN),"Amazon is missing a giant opportunity and it leaves the door wide open for someone else to steal a chunk of the market (AMZN)
• Increasingly, people don't want to buy stuff. They want to rent it.
• The segment is growing and retail rentals are projected to near $2 billion in sales worldwide by 2025.
• Still, the largest online sellers, like Amazon, have not moved to cash in on the trend.
• Experts say that's because rental is hard to do right, and it's expensive, so the margin potential is likely not yet worth the investment.

Increasingly, people would rather rent rather than own their belongings. Billion-dollar companies, like Rent the Runway, have been formed to take advantage of the trend. Clothing makers like Urban Outfitters, Express, and others have jumped in to compete.

And the trend will likely only continue as today's youth age up.

Many of the 1,800 Generation Z members Business Insider recently surveyed indicated that they favored sustainability and uniqueness over commodity goods, which makes them strong candidates for rentals.

""Gen Z lives their life in the cloud — their content, entertainment, and music all exist in the cloud with unlimited choice,"" Rent the Runway CEO Jennifer Hyman told Business Insider's Mary Hanbury. ""We are offering them the exact same thing for their physical lives.""

But it's not just clothes. Everything from vacuums to camping equipment is now up for rental at a variety of outlets, from startups like Omni to old guards retailers like outdoor seller REI, which is heavily expanding rental offerings.

For some high-priced brands, rental offers a chance to allow young consumers access to their products at an easier entry point, and maybe even hook a customer for life.

""They don't necessarily want to commit, but they have disposable income and they want nice brands and want nice furniture and they appreciate good design,"" Neela Montgomery, CEO of Crate & Barrel, said at a conference in March, according to the New York Times. ""We want those customers to appreciate CB2 and Crate at the earliest age.""

But Amazon, the largest online retailer in the US, is nowhere in the rental space. It offers rental textbooks for students, but that's it.

It's not hard to imagine some savvy entrepreneur creating the Amazon of Rentals while there's an opening. Many are already trying.

The hold up may be that rentals are a hard, low-margin business and that demand isn't meaningful enough yet to attract Amazon, from either an acquisition or an in-house standpoint.

""I don't think it's that big a market opportunity,"" Sucharita Kodali, a principal analyst at Forrester, said, referring to the retail rental market. ""Amazon grew by $40 billion last year. No rental business is anywhere near that large.""

It's hard to put a number to the size of the market as a whole, due to its many sectors and players. The online clothing rental industry is projected to double from $1 billion in 2017 to $1.9 billion worldwide by 2023, according to a report by Allied Market Research.

Rental is also expensive. Startup costs for rental businesses require the retailer to foot the bill for designer dresses, furnishings, expensive electronics, or outdoor equipment without getting a real return until customers rent it a number of times.

It also requires the retailer to master the process of getting items back to them, cleaning them and preparing them to be sent back out again. Quality control and safety for some products are also an issue.

That really isn't in Amazon's current wheelhouse.

""They try really, really hard to just be operationally focused on how quickly they turn products through their buildings,"" said Jim Hull of JDA Software.

For Amazon, ""it's always about getting things, whether that's digital content, physical goods, directly to the consumer in the fastest, easiest way possible,"" Tom McLeod, CEO and founder of rental company Omni, said. ""And historically, their business hasn't been around to the circular economy, and getting the things back.""

Creating a reverse logistics pipeline that could handle the return part of the rental is something that Amazon does not have expertise in. And they can't just conjure one out of thin air.

""Quite simply, rental requires a lot of work,"" Bob Phibbs, a retail consultant, said.

For high-ticket items — watches, cocktail dresses, handbags, jewelry — another way in which rental is labor-intensive is the process required to authenticate the returned goods to ensure they are not counterfeit. That process is both time-consuming and expensive.

It also ""doesn't really scale,"" Phibbs said.

Another issue is the management of inventory, where Amazon will have to keep, store, and warehouse seasonal items when they aren't being rented, for example, camping equipment in the winter or wool suits in the summer. That runs counter to Amazon's standard method of operating, which is to get inventory in and out as fast as humanly possible.

Retail rental has also not yet reached mass adoption. According to a survey of 1,000 customers performed by JDA Software, only 25% of customers said they have used a rental service. Of those who had, 75% said it was for renting apparel for a special occasion like a wedding.

That doesn't mean Amazon isn't considering the rental space.

Earlier this year, Amazon offerred rentals of musical instruments in addition to the textbook rental it still offers. The instrument option is not currently available.

Amazon did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

""Right now, [the website is] only their textbooks, but the way they have worded it, and the way you get to it from some of the different links, implies that they built it to cover a whole lot more,"" Hull said.

There are also two job openings Amazon is hiring for a program called ""Rentals by Amazon,"" which has a different name than the ""Amazon Rentals"" logo on Amazon.com/rentals page.

Amazon may be forced to reckon with rentals eventually, as customers — especially younger ones — turn their focus to sustainability and trying to lower the impact of consumerism on the planet.

""It would be myopic to assume that Amazon would never look in this direction because they look kind of in all directions,"" McLeod said.

""But do I think that they will be the incumbents' first mover into the space? I very much do not think that.""

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Thousands of people have turned out for gay pride celebrations across the world, including a boisterous march through the Mexican capital.

Rainbow flags and umbrellas swayed and music pounded as Saturday’s march along Paseo de la Reforma got underway, with couples, families and activists seeking to raise visibility for sexual diversity in a country still plagued by macho attitudes.

Same-sex civil unions have been legal in Mexico City since 2007, and gay marriage since 2009. A handful of Mexican states have followed suit, and same-sex unions are supposed to be recognized nationwide.

Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini branded Sea-Watch 3 captain Carola Rackete, who was taken into custody Saturday, an “outlaw” who put the lives of the border police at risk.

The German humanitarian group Sea Watch had rescued 53 people from an unseaworthy boat launched by Libya-based traffickers on June 12. In recent days, 13 migrants were taken off Sea-Watch 3 for medical reasons and taken to Italy.

Salvini had demanded other European Union countries take the remaining 40. On Friday, five countries offered to take them.

The departure of the 11 Republicans had prevented the Senate from reaching a quorum to vote on the bill that was aimed at countering climate change. They left the state after Gov. Kate Brown ordered the state police to bring them to the state capitol. Meanwhile, more than 100 bills have stacked up in the Senate.

LA CRESCENTA, Calif. (AP) — Searchers have found a hiker who has been missing in the mountains north of Los Angeles for a week.

Authorities say 73-year-old Eugene Jo was found alive Saturday by one of 11 search-and-rescue crews that have been searching the San Gabriel Mountains for him.

Sgt. Greg Taylor with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s department says cellphone coverage is spotty in the mountains, so he has no immediate word on Jo’s condition. He says Jo was being transported to a hospital to be examined.

Jo was hiking with a group to the 8,000-foot (2,438-meter) summit of Mount Waterman on June 22 when he became separated from them.

The rule was supposed to take effect on July 22 but the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and its opponents in a California lawsuit mutually agreed Friday to delay a final ruling on the matter for four months.

A federal judge in San Francisco permitted the change on Saturday.

Opponents contend that the DHHS exceeded its authority with the rule and say it would deny health care to women and to homosexuals by giving prejudice the force of law.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A construction contractor says the primary suspect in the killing of University of Utah student Mackenzie Lueck approached him in April about building a secretive and soundproof room under a front porch.

Brian Wolf told the Desert News that the construction request from homeowner Ayoola A. Ajayi made him uneasy and included hooks mounted high on a concrete wall for reasons that didn’t make sense. Wolf turned the job down and reported the encounter to police after seeing news reports Friday of Ajayi’s arrested in Lueck’s death.

Salt Lake City Police spokeswoman Christina Judd confirmed that Wolf recounted the story to detectives.

A SWAT Team arrested Ajayi on Friday and police say he will be charged with aggravated murder, kidnapping, justice obstruction and desecration of a body in Lueck’s death.

NEW YORK (AP) — A former New York City police detective who was a leader in the fight for the Sept. 11 Victims Compensation Fund has died at age 53.

Detective Luis Alvarez’s death from cancer Saturday was announced by Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea.

Alvarez appeared with former “Daily Show” host Jon Stewart earlier this month to plead with Congress to extend the compensation fund. He entered hospice care days later.

His family said in a Facebook post that Alvarez touched many lives by sharing his battle with cancer.

Alvarez was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2016. He blamed his illness on the three months he spent in the rubble of the World Trade Center’s twin towers after the 2001 terrorist attacks.

BRUSSELS (AP) — A music festival in Belgium featuring major stars like rapper Cardi B has come to an abrupt end amid security concerns and a fraud investigation.

VestiVille was canceled Friday, the start of the three-day event, with thousands of festival-goers on the grounds in Lommel, in Belgium’s Flemish region.

Quoting Flemish press, Belgium’s RTBF network said Saturday that the Limbourg prosecutor’s office has opened an investigation on suspicion of fraud over payments and quoted spokesman Jeroen Swijssen as saying three festival organizers were questioned Friday night.

VestiVille tweeted Friday that Lommel Mayor Bob Nijs stopped the festival on security grounds. The tweet said that after consulting security services and security for star rapper A$AP Rocky, “it was decided that the safety of the artist and the public could not be guaranteed.”

751,New town recycling guide available online,"The annual Town of Arlington guide to the recycling and trash is available online at arlingtonma.gov/recycle.

Printed copies are being mailed in July, so be on the lookout for the blue and green mailer.

Residents should save this handy reference guide to track holiday collection delays.

Also listed are household hazardous-waste collections (eight a year in Lexington) and the Arlington Recycling Center dates for medical sharps collections (four a year) and secure document shredding (three a year).

Collection is delayed for the Independence Day holiday on July Fourth, with Thursday’s collection on Friday and Friday’s collection on Saturday.

The July Recycling Center takes place on a Sunday for the first time, on July 14, from 9 a.m. to noon. By holding one Sunday event annually, the town hopes to better accommodate residents who work or observe faith traditions each Saturday.

From 1 to 4 p.m. July 14 residents are invited to roll up their sleeves to fix their broken items along with knowledgeable coaches at the Fixit Clinic, Thompson School Gym, 187 Everett St. More can be found in the news story at arlingtonma.gov/recycle.

Some recycling changes on the way

Those involved have renamed this year’s guide ""Toward Zero Waste"" to emphasize some of the additional activities the town will be encouraging.

While complete zero waste is aspirational, the name reflects a growing national trend to stop relying on basic curbside recycling to solve the rise in material waste at the consumer level.

Sharing, avoiding single-use items, purchasing durable goods, and making state-level policy changes that require take-back and repair are all strategies that reduce waste.

Recycling is in the national news lately and some of the messages are confusing and alarming. Be assured that while the business of recycling may be less profitable, there are still manufacturers who want to purchase the plastic, paper and cardboard, metals, and glass that we carefully separate out from our trash.

Fortunately for Arlington, town costs for recycling have remained consistent, yet we are planning for a future when they may rise.

Massachusetts has waste-ban laws that require we separate out our recycling from trash, so there will not be any interruption of service. A new state initiative seeks to make the rules for recycling easier for everyone, so Arlington has signed on to the RecycleSmart program.

Unfortunately, this means that cartons (milk, juice, soup) that were previously collected as mixed paper recycling can no longer be recycled. The town asks you to place these containers in the trash.

Another change to our curbside program is that shredded paper will no longer be collected as recycling and should instead be placed in the trash.

Anyone who visits the recycling sorting facility, called GreenWorks, witnesses what a mechanical and human effort it takes to sort the single-stream recycling back into the metal, glass, multiple plastic and paper/cardboard streams that each get baled and marketed separately.

GreenWorks has been struggling to keep shredded paper clean enough to market, so instead it ends up contributing to the residual trash at the end of the sorting process.

Residents who are interested in visiting the facility to see the operations in person, please email Recycling Coordinator Charlotte Milan: cmilan at town.arlington.ma.us.

While we know these changes are disappointing, Milan explains, the town is part of a much larger system of recycling creators and sorters. That whole system needs to work together to create cleaner raw materials that are of value to manufactures making new consumer items.

Going forward, the town will make adjustments to its program in coordination with the MA RecycleSmart program, likely on an annual basis.

For additional recycling solutions in Massachusetts specifically, check out recyclesmart.org.

Fortunately, RecycleSmart allows pizza boxes in curbside recycling. A little food oil/grease is acceptable, according to GreenWorks and the seven other recycling sorting facilities in Massachusetts.

Please be sure there is no food, waxy paper or plastic items in your cardboard pizza box. Very cheesy boxes should continue to be placed with the trash.

The town is adding household fire extinguisher collection at the Recycling Center events for a $5 each fee.

Alternatively, residents are welcome to discharge and disassemble their fire extinguishers at home, then bring them to the Recycling Center as scrap metal at no charge.

Discharging into a plastic bag (outdoors, not on a windy day) can be a great way to get a feel for what it’s like to use these important household safety tools. Online videos may offer reassuring instruction.

What else can we each do to work toward zero waste? Check out tools and household items from the Robbins Library’s Library of Things.

It’s free and available to anyone with a library card. More at robbinslibrary.org.

Swap your stuff. Together with the Facebook group called Everything Is Free in Arlington, a community clothing swap was embraced by hundreds of participants during Eco Week in April.

The town plans to repeat that in 2020 and add a fall swap Sunday, Nov. 3, at Thompson School, so save the date.

And on Saturday, May 16, there will be a townwide yard sale. Stay tuned.

Residents who are eager to take more action toward zero waste can take a major step by purchasing new items made from recycled content, such as household paper goods and office paper. Companies are now making toys and even clothing from what was once curbside recycled yogurt cups and water bottles.

The emerging circular economy can help bolster local jobs and remanufacturing, as well as reduce the amount of new raw materials we extract from the Earth.",United States,2019.06
753,Learning from a circular economy pioneer,"Back in the 1990s, 60 percent of waste went to landfill in the Swedish city of Lund. Today it's less than 2 percent, and the region is a pioneer of the burgeoning circular economy.

How did they do it? ""A combination of goals, waste management, politicians and citizens' common will,"" says Erik Rånlund from Lund.

SCALIBUR partners went to Lund to investigate how they brought about this transformation.

Residents of Lund have no less than eight waste bins for different materials: food, coloured glass, clear glass, cardboard, printed paper, metals, plastics and residual waste. This initial separation is fundamental to the success of Lund's recycling system.

To simplify collection in urban areas, the city installed underground communal bins. These bins extend three metres underground, and are drawn up into the sky in order to be emptied by the city garbage trucks.

Suburban residents are the proud owners of two extra-large wheely bins, each with four compartments for different types of waste. To handle these bins, the city waste management company commissioned a funky collection truck, also with four chambers.

Getting value from waste

Waste sorting by residents results in a very clean separation of materials. This makes it easier to recycle them into high value materials.

At the regional processing plant, run by SYSAV in nearby Malmö, food waste is converted into biofertilisers and biogas. Packaging and paper waste is sent around Sweden where they are recycled into new products.

The Lund region also has one of the world's most advanced waste-to-energy plants, meaning any residual waste that can't be recycled is turned into heat and electricity.

Lund is now so good at recycling that other EU countries export their waste there for processing. All this activity has made Lund a hub for innovative companies working on circular economy: food packaging producer Tetra Pak was founded here, among others.

All stakeholders have their own role in this success story. Companies that sell plastic bottles in Sweden must themselves pay for their recycling. Producers such as Coca-Cola fund a deposit scheme, whereby consumers return their plastic bottles to machines in supermarkets.

Citizens remain central to the success of the whole system. And Lund works hard to communicate and emphasize the benefits of recycling for residents.

Compost made from garden waste is for sale around the city. Instead of running on fossil fuels, garbage trucks and other municipal vehicles run on biogas made from food waste. The waste-to-energy plant serves the district heating system, bringing hot water into houses across the city.

The municipality of Lund refuses to rest on its laurels. A futuristic underground vacuum system will be installed in 2020, making waste trucks redundant in one part of the city.

Recognising that prevention is top of the waste hierarchy, the authorities are also focusing more attention on campaigns to reduce the amount of waste produced in the city.

In the SCALIBUR project we aim to transfer some of the knowledge from Lund to three pilot municipalities—Madrid, Albano Laziale and Kozani—focusing on food waste and sewage sludge.

This information will also be shared with other EU municipalities through a training programme and workshops, foreseen in 2020.",United States,2019.06
754,PepsiCo Advances Circular Economy for Plastics,"PepsiCo Inc. announced that LIFEWTR will be packaged in 100 percent rPET (recycled polyethylene terephthalate), and bubly will no longer be packaged in plastic. The company's AQUAFINA water brand also will offer aluminum can packaging in U.S. foodservice outlets, while the brand tests the move in retail.

The changes, which all go into effect next year, are expected to eliminate more than 8,000 metric tons of virgin plastic and approximately 11,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, representing the latest ambitious steps in the company's sustainability journey and pursuit of a circular economy for plastics. These efforts advance PepsiCo's goals to by 2025 make 100 percent of its packaging recyclable, compostable or biodegradable and use 25 percent recycled plastic content in all its plastic packaging.

""Tackling plastic waste is one of my top priorities, and I take this challenge personally,"" said PepsiCo Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta in a statement. ""As one of the world's leading food and beverage companies, we recognize the significant role PepsiCo can play in helping to change the way society makes, uses and disposes of plastics. We are doing our part to address the issue head on by reducing, recycling and reinventing our packaging to make it more sustainable, and we won't stop until we live in a world where plastics are renewed and reused.""

Naked Juice has been working since 2009 to ensure its bottles are made of 100 percent rPET and can be turned into bottles again and again. By making its bottles with rPET, the brand also uses about 25 percent less energy than if it used virgin plastic.

PepsiCo is one of the largest users of food-grade recycled PET in the world, and the company is also working to help increase the supply needed to meet its packaging goals. In tandem with current suppliers and partners like The Recycling Partnership, Loop Industries, Alliance to End Plastic Waste and World Economic Forum's Global Plastic Action Partnership, PepsiCo is aiming to both increase recycling rates and improve the plastic recycling infrastructure.

""We are really excited to evolve our packaging across PepsiCo's water portfolio to make a positive impact,"" said Stacy Taffet, vice president of water portfolio for PepsiCo, in a statement. ""We created LIFEWTR to be an inspirational and purpose-driven brand, and we're expanding that vision by using recycled packaging to deliver our premium water. At the same time, bubly, our sparkling water brand that is full of flavor and personality, has already shaken up the sparkling water category and will continue to do so with this bold move.""",United States,2019.06
755,"Raw Juce Joins Circular Economy, Diverts 2,000 Pounds of Pulp to Farm for Animal Feed","Raw Juce has signed a multi-year agreement with Rubicon Global in a move to reach toward zero waste. Founded in 2010, Raw Juce creates organic cold-pressed juices, smoothies, and acai bowls. The company currently has nine locations across Florida. Rubicon will work with Raw J?ce to divert all of its raw pulp produced daily away to a local farm in Boca Raton, where the pulp will be used as organic animal feed, creating a “truly circular waste solution for this growing small business,” Rubicon says.

At Raw Juce’s main manufacturing facility in Boca Raton, Florida, more than 20 different organic juices are cold-pressed every day and shipped to each location. This daily manufacturing process results in approximately 2,000 pounds of raw fruit and vegetable pulp being produced per day. Raw Juce worked with Rubicon executives to map a sustainability program for the company, which includes the diversion of all of its raw pulp away from landfill to the Boca Raton farm.

“Getting to zero waste is a journey,” says David Rachelson, VP of sustainability at Rubicon Global. Rubicon’s solution will help Raw Juce in its journey toward zero waste and claiming a place in the circular economy, the company says.

756,Circular Economy Part III: Make recycling part of life,"In Mikko Tanner’s home in Helsinki, there are different bins for paper, cardboard, plastics, metal, cans, food waste and mixed waste. When the bins are filled up, he then takes them to the recycling site at their apartment building that has a few larger bins with clear instructions on what goes where.

The bin for mixed waste is the smallest of these. After disassembling a product that is to be dumped, the residue left for burning does not take up much space.

Where Hong Kong seeks to reduce domestic waste by charging trash bags according to volume, Finland promotes a more holistic approach – recycling as much as possible at home to eventually send less waste to the incinerator.

This is an example of how citizens are participating the country’s circular economy roadmap at the household level.

The Finns have become used to taking glass bottles to the recycling sites for cash refunds. This has helped instill the thinking that recycling brings monetary rewards in the short term, and the habit of recycling in the long run.

In the Nordic country, there is no talk of penalties for not sorting waste at home or placing waste in the wrong bin. It’s all about consciousness and trust.

The Finns believe in collective responsibility. When one resident does not do his or her job well, others will suffer. It is the idea of “one for all” that encourages them to stick to their recycling routine.

“It is more expensive to process mixed waste. If the bin for mixed waste gets filled up faster, all the residents have to bear the extra costs,” Tanner told Harbour Times.

At his compound, mixed waste is collected by a contractor twice a month. If the contractor has to come more than twice to collect the mixed waste, the extra cost is born by all the residents. Those with a bigger apartment have to pay more.

Tanner said it is impossible to track down who places the waste wrongly or dumps more mixed waste. The solution is to educate people and make them well aware and informed of their actions.

“We place clear signs and instructions next to the bins to teach people what can be recycled, and which bin certain waste goes to. This helps people understand how things work and they have no excuse for not doing it,” he said.

Residents also pay a monthly fee to the housing board that manages the apartment building for heating, water and waste management. The cost for recycling is bundled with other utilities, so they don’t feel there is an extra cost to being green.

Be part of it

Tanner is part of the housing board at his compound, which is voluntarily made up by local residents. The board gathers a few times a year to discuss management issues, including sending out reminders to everyone about where to place their waste.

“To be an influencer, you need to be part of the housing board. Otherwise, others will make decisions for you,” he said.

In recent years, Finland has been promoting recycling plastic, and this has gathered support from the environmentally conscious younger generation.

“Three years ago, residents of my building got together to discuss how we wanted to recycle our waste. The younger ones suggested a bin for recycling plastics, while the older residents thought it would be too much work,” Liisa Lemmetty, a 35-year old social worker in Helsinki, told Harbour Times.

Lemmetty was part of the housing board at her compound and she and other young residents decided to go ahead and install a bin for recycling plastics.

“We found that we are actually saving more money by recycling more plastics. By taking one more step, you are actually helping yourself too,” she added.

Like Tanner, she has six bins at home to separate waste. “It has become a habit and I don’t find it troublesome when sorting my waste,” she said.

While citizens are putting in effort to sort waste from home, the business sector then processes the waste and turns it into products. This goes alongside other efforts, such as reusing waste and adopting sustainable designs.

This is a national strategy that everyone is part of.",United States,2019.06
759,Meet The Master’s Graduate Who Took Heineken Into The Circular Economy,"Working as a sustainability coordinator for Heineken Mexico, Ricardo Weigend knew he had a tough job on his hands.

His goal was to meet the company’s 20% carbon emission reduction target.

Liaising with Heineken’s global office in the Netherlands, he led improvements, replacing fossil fuel trucks with bio-fuel trucks, changing the mode of transportation for exporting beer, and suggesting alternative driving techniques to save fuel.

While many professionals use MBAs and master’s degrees to switch jobs, Ricardo wanted to gain more skills and knowledge around sustainability and corporate social responsibility (CSR) and bring that back to his employer.

“Heineken wasn’t an expert on sustainability,” he explains. “They were very oriented towards that, but without the right skills, so I found that I needed to develop if I really wanted a career in sustainability.”

Ricardo spoke with Heineken Mexico’s CEO, who allowed him to take a year out and agreed to partially sponsor his degree.

Ricardo’s choice of program was at a school over 5,000 miles away: the at Cranfield School of Management in the UK.

Cranfield has twice won Queen’s Anniversary Prizes for its strength in sustainability.

Once in 2015, for its research on sanitation in developing countries, which included developing a system that converts human waste to clean water. Then, in 2017, when Cranfield created large-scale soil and environmental datasets to help inform decisions about the sustainability of natural resources.

Cranfield also has its own solar farm, which produces 5% of the campus’ electricity and also acts as a research facility for students attending energy courses.

Divided into twelve modules, Cranfield’s Management and Corporate Sustainability MSc includes teaching on accounting and finance, strategic management, and sustainability in practice.

It teaches professionals the practicalities of how businesses can successfully embed sustainability into their core purpose and strategy. Some modules also include consultancy-type challenges, where professionals respond to a project brief set by a real organization.

Ricardo focused his degree thesis on a resolving Heineken Mexico’s problem of shifting towards renewable energy in transportation. He then applied the project on a model scale for the company.

“To have that combination of management and corporate sustainability helps professionals take into consideration a very practical side of businesses,” says Ricardo.

“That really helps when you’re trying to implement something in organizations or even in cities, because the policymakers are the equivalent of the managers in an organization.”

Once Ricardo completed his master’s and returned to Heineken Mexico, he implemented a four-year strategy for a transition to circular economy in all the different pillars of the company’s framework.

Instead of solely concentrating on CO2 emissions, Heineken Mexico began focusing on business models and practices to accomplish economic prosperity, environmental quality, and social equity.

As a result, Mexico became the first operating country within the Heineken world to make that transition. The global office in the Netherlands then took this approach onboard and began replicating it with other countries around the world.

“I became a stronger professional,” says Ricardo. “The master’s helped me differentiate myself from other professionals within the company and in Mexico.”

In 2017, a major research report found that just 100 companies worldwide are responsible for over 70% of global carbon emissions.

Senior lecturer Dr Rosina Watson, who leads the corporate sustainability specialist module on the Cranfield master’s program, says society increasingly expects businesses, and business professionals, to respond to environmental and social challenges.

“Businesses sustainability strategies are critical in order to increase trust, mitigate risk, reduce cost and drive growth,” she explains. “It’s not about ‘doing the right thing,’ but ensuring the survival of a business into the longer term.

“For businesses that get in front and work out how to respond quickly and meaningfully and learn how to compete in this changing world, there is massive opportunity.”",United States,2019.06
760,Bioplastics and circularity: Why can't we be friends? | Greenbiz,"The future of plastics isn’t what it used to be.

The invention of plastics in the early 20th century promised to change the world. It did — and then some. The pliable, convenient material’s near-exponential growth has enabled modern life, but its lack of designed-in end-of-life considerations has created a global waste crisis.

At GreenBiz's circular economy conference, Circularity 19, in Minneapolis last week, Valerie Craig, deputy to the chief scientist and vice president of impact initiatives at National Geographic Society, said on the main stage: ""Plastics have undeniably changed our lives — in a lot of ways for the better — but we have created a pollution crisis of almost an unfathomable scale.""

However, flexible plastic still has a place in a circular economy that’s fighting climate change — to protect food from spoiling, or decomposing, a process that produces the potent greenhouse gas methane; to create lighter, smaller products that optimize space and reduce emissions while transporting them, Craig noted.

So how do we keep the advantages with of plastic without contributing to the world’s waste problem?

Ending plastic pollution while transitioning to a circular economy means using the materials that are already in existence on the planet (on land and in the oceans) — which requires systems change. There’s no silver bullet solution, of course. So if we still need malleable, lightweight plastics, how do we avoid extracting petroleum to produce plastics that create products that end up in a landfill?

Many are calling for a new paradigm (one that’s actually quite old) — plastics that are sourced from plants, rather than petroleum, and that can be broken down again safely at the end of their lives.

What exactly are plant-based plastics, and why do they matter?

Technically speaking, plant-based plastics are blends of parts of a plant that are manufactured using the same technologies as conventional plastics to create similar products with equivalent mechanical properties. To get super technical, the plant parts range from polysaccharides (starch, such as corn and potatoes; cellulose, such as sugar cane and sugar beet; lignin, such as wood; and chitin, such as fungi) to proteins (wheat gluten, silk and wool) to lipids (plant oils and used cooking oils).

Plant-based plastics can become consumer packaging (trays, films, bottles), convenience food disposables (cutlery), bags (shopping, garden or home waste), personal-care disposals (diapers, cosmetics) and more. Bioplastic polymers also have been used in more durable applications such as in textiles, consumer goods, automotive parts and building and construction. (Such plastics actually were developed in the late 1800s, but when fossil fuel-sourced plastics were developed and commercialized at an incredibly cheap price point, the synthetic versions quickly took over.)

Plastics have undeniably changed our lives — in a lot of ways for the better — but we have created a pollution crisis of almost an unfathomable scale. Bioplastic offers oft-cited advantages over the synthetic alternatives: reduced fossil fuel use, smaller carbon footprint and quicker decomposition rates. They also contain fewer toxins than traditional plastics.

Still, plant-sourced plastics must have final destinations, too. What happens at the end of their lives depends upon the exact type of material they’re made out of, and how that can be broken down to best keep those ""molecules at play."" And that ""end"" could range from a recycling plant to an industrial composting facility to a home compost kit to a clean landfill.

Bioplastics currently represent a share of about 1 percent of the entire plastics market — but that’s expected to grow significantly in the coming years due to consumer demand and companies’ growing sustainability efforts.

That also means that appropriate end-of-life options must be better developed, as well.

All plastics technically ""degrade"" — or break down into smaller particles over time. Some bioplastics can biodegrade — which means they can be broken down by microorganisms under the right conditions (without oxygen and with heat), within a certain amount of time, into water, carbon dioxide and compost. Others must be industrially composted — which means that in a compost facility, microorganisms break them down into carbon dioxide, water, inorganic compounds and biomass at the same rate as other organic materials in the compost pile, leaving no toxic residue.

If this sounds confusing, that’s because currently, it is. Often, consumers don’t know the difference between biodegradable and compostable — which means they’re confused about where to put their biodegradable spoons or their compostable cups once they’re done with them. In addition, composting facilities vary by region, so sometimes compostable and biodegradable products end up in landfills regardless.

The organic recycling landscape was the subject of discussion during the Circularity 19 session ""Compostable Materials and the Circular Economy."" Because compostable and biodegradable materials — from plastics to other organic materials — are a significant portion of the waste stream, with a distinct value chain, recovering some of that value is critical to a circular economy.

Switching away from single-use plastics is a way for businesses to be competitive and engage with a loyal sector of consumers. Improving organic composting systems is one solution, as is increasing the commercialization of bioplastics and raising consumer awareness around their end-of-life characteristics. That means deploying capital investments for new infrastructure for composting. It also means standardizing labels on products so consumers know the options.

Plus: ""Regulations are changing,"" warned panel participant Janice Tran, director of Generate Capital’s waste investment team, with responsibilities ranging from origination, acquisitions, asset management and market development. ""It’s coming. The time is now for opportunity."" Companies can take advantage of them by taking action.

Where there’s systems change, there’s an opportunity for businesses. Businesses can connect with bioplastics through their circularity strategies.

In order to get bioplastics to commercially scale successfully, companies need to adopt them for their potential applications in operations at greater rates (packaging, etc.)

Avoiding petroleum-based plastics is actually one of the biggest opportunities for businesses in embracing the circular economy, noted Suzanne Shelton, sustainability marketing expert with the Shelton Group, on stage at Circularity 19.

""One-third of Americans are actively trying to buy something packaged in something other than single-use plastics,"" Shelton noted. And the ones that are still buying them don’t have any other options, she said. ""People are literally stuck — they can’t not buy it — and how do they feel?"" Trapped, angry, defeated.

""There is a journey of goodness for you here. There is an ability to build brands and sell products."" Switching away from single-use plastics is a way for businesses to be competitive and engage with a loyal sector of consumers.

There are also major opportunities for partnerships with smaller materials startups and projects, which face stark valleys of death. Big companies can uptake innovations: L’Oreal’s new Seed Phytonutrients brand uses water-resistant paper bottles, while Nestlé has invested in Danimer Scientific, a biotechnology manufacturer of biodegradable and compostable polymers.

In a just circular economy, flexible, bio-based plastics will be used and reused safely to the end of their lives. Innovative companies can work on that transition right now.",United States,2019.06
762,IAEA Workshop Highlights Novel Trends in Decommissioning,"Decommissioning of nuclear power plants and other nuclear facilities based on sustainability and circular economy principles can bring great benefits, including less waste, lower costs and reduced risk of delays. It is also a great way to engage stakeholders, agreed experts at a recent International Workshop on Application of Sustainability and Circular Economy Principles to Nuclear Decommissioning. The workshop was organized by the IAEA in Rome, Italy, and was hosted by Sogin, the state-owned company responsible for Italy’s decommissioning and radioactive waste management programme.

“Recycling is already well established in decommissioning work, and the principles of circular economy are opening a new dimension,” said Christophe Xerri, Director of the IAEA’s Division of Nuclear Fuel Cycle and Waste Technology. “Preparation for and implementation of decommissioning of nuclear facilities can benefit from good practices, technologies and circular economy experience coming from non-nuclear industries.”

Circular economy is a socio-economic concept aimed at minimizing waste and making the most of resources. This approach seeks to find new uses for assets and their components consistent with commercial and sustainable objectives.

“Decommissioning of nuclear power plants no longer in use as well as of other industrial facilities is also a matter of ethics,” added Xerri. “We have built and used those facilities for the benefit of our societies. But we should make sure that we clean them up for the generations to come.”

Innovation is most often associated with new technologies. But innovation also means bringing new thinking into a well-established process and decommissioning is no exception.

Kristina Gillin, Principal Consultant at Lloyd’s Register told attendees that most of the world’s reactors were built before the concept of sustainable development was conceived. “This workshop is an important step towards incorporating sustainability principles into the decommissioning process in a way that has potential to benefit both the industry and society at large.”

Luca Desiata, the CEO of Sogin, said: “We are very satisfied to continue the collaboration with the IAEA. The topic of this year, circular economy, is one of the pillars of Sogin Academy, which aims to become a reference centre for training and development in the nuclear decommissioning industry.”

During the workshop from 18 to 21 June 2019, experts from France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom discussed ways of effectively addressing circular economy principles in decommissioning and waste management and presented several examples and case studies. They underlined the need for the post-decommissioning future of the site to be considered as the integral part of the decommissioning planning and implementation.

The workshop included an overview of the European and national regulatory frameworks, taking into account green engineering and Green Public Procurement (see below) rules regarding circular economy, analysis of the flow and management of the reusable or recyclable materials arising from decommissioning activities, assessment of the actual practice of recycling and reuse, identification of the obstacles to recovering scrap materials arising from decommissioning, and waste avoidance approaches.

Naked Juice, a category leader in premium fruit and veggie juices and smoothies, has been working since 2009 to ensure its bottles are made of 100% rPET and can be turned into bottles again and again. By making its bottles with rPET, the brand also uses about 25% less energy than if it used virgin plastic.

PepsiCo is one of the largest users of food-grade recycled PET in the world, and the company is also working to help reliably increase the supply needed to meet its packaging goals. In tandem with current suppliers and partners like The Recycling Partnership, Loop Industries, Alliance to End Plastic Waste, and World Economic Forum's Global Plastic Action Partnership (GPAP), PepsiCo is aiming to both increase recycling rates and improve the plastic recycling infrastructure.

773,3D Printing & the Circular Economy Part 4: Anthroposphere,"Today we will be discussing the anthroposphere in relation to a circular economy. The anthroposphere can be defined as the part of the environment that is made or modified by humans for use in human activities and human habitats. People also refer to the anthroposphere as the technosphere. Humans have evolved over time to build more tools to navigate their environment. Technology is the crux of this. In order to navigate one’s environment, there is an implied and necessary usage of resources within an environment. To thrive, one must efficiently use their resources, but the question is whether or not humans are doing so. The circular economy is trying to establish a thought process and system of humans having a connection to their habits that cause deterioration of the world. We shall look into how the current state of humanity and the anthroposphere point towards how close we are to moving towards a circular economy.

The history of human development and advancement is imbued in creation. We are a species that continuously builds. This is a testament to the human society’s sense of exploration and experimentation. We are consistently challenging the status quo and trying to make our lives better. With humans inherently trying to make the world precise or technology driven, we are applying a mindset that is narrow minded at times. The technology and innovations we create are susceptible to unsustainable production methods. An example can be taken from overproduction with the use of injection molding systems at different companies. The technology itself is great as it produces such a large quantity of items for us in a short time, but that is a downfall of the technology as well. It is super efficient, and it causes us over produce. Building a machine such as an injection molder also leads to the utilization of resources inherently. Now it is important to denote that the technology is not bad; it just leads to unintended problems in terms of sustainability, the anthroposphere, and the circular economy. This is the internal debate of innovation and technology. We are trying to advance society, but we may be digressing it if we use all our resources. There is only a finite supply it seems.

How does Human Development relate to the Circular Economy?

In terms of humans, I think a good amount of people in the developing world are okay in terms of life standards. This is granted a generalization, but there is validity to this. There is another opposing statement that occurs from this frame of reference: Life in underdeveloped nations is affected by developed nations having better standards of life. This does not necessarily bode well for the whole anthroposphere and the circular economy. It also seems unlikely that everywhere on Earth will have an equal distribution of resources and technology development. So how do we still work on this ideal of a circular economy when things seem unlikely? If we want to live the ideals of a circular economy to better the anthroposphere, various nations should be more focused on producing what they can based on their environment. Would this be good or bad though?

Based on the issues brought up today, I will be doing more research. I believe the importance of localization in production is a major key within our anthroposphere. These are some basic questions and assumptions I have. I will be researching and providing statistics on various items within industrial waste as well as nations that are focused on localization of their production and how this contributes to the overall anthroposphere.",United States,2019.06
775,PepsiCo Advances Circular Economy for Plastics; Announces LIFEWTR® Packaging with 100% Recycled Plastic and Elimination of Plastic Bottles for bubly™,"Aquafina to Offer Aluminum Can Packaging in U.S. Food Service Outlets While Testing in Retail

Builds on Success of Naked Juice, the First and Only Nationally Distributed Juice Brand to Use 100% Recycled Packaging

PURCHASE, N.Y., June 27, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) today announced that LIFEWTR will be packaged in 100% rPET (recycled polyethylene terephthalate), and bubly will no longer be packaged in plastic. The company's AQUAFINA® water brand will also offer aluminum can packaging in U.S. food service outlets, while the brand tests the move in retail. The changes, which all go into effect next year, are expected to eliminate more than 8,000 metric tons of virgin plastic and approximately 11,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, representing the latest ambitious steps in the company's sustainability journey and pursuit of a circular economy for plastics. They reinforce and advance PepsiCo's goals to by 2025 make 100% of its packaging recyclable, compostable, or biodegradable and use 25% recycled plastic content in all its plastic packaging.

""Tackling plastic waste is one of my top priorities and I take this challenge personally,"" PepsiCo Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta. ""As one of the world's leading food and beverage companies, we recognize the significant role PepsiCo can play in helping to change the way society makes, uses, and disposes of plastics. We are doing our part to address the issue head on by reducing, recycling and reinventing our packaging to make it more sustainable, and we won't stop until we live in a world where plastics are renewed and reused.""

Naked Juice, a category leader in premium fruit and veggie juices and smoothies, has been working since 2009 to ensure its bottles are made of 100% rPET and can be turned into bottles again and again. By making its bottles with rPET, the brand also uses about 25% less energy than if it used virgin plastic.

777,Sustainability alert: Sprite replaces iconic green bottle with clear plastic,"Coca-Cola Great Britain has announced Sprite bottles will switch from green plastic to clear plastic to enable bottle-to-bottle recycling, effective September 2019. Sprite also will increase the amount of recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) in all bottles by 50 percent in 2020.

“Using more recycled plastic is a critical element of our sustainable packaging strategy, as it reduces the amount of virgin material used in our packs,” says Jon Woods, general manager, Great Britain.

Coca-Cola Great Britain, in partnership with European Partners, also announced GLACÉAU Smartwater bottles will be made from 100 percent rPET by the end of 2019. The company says it is also on track to double to amount of rPET used in all other plastic bottles in early 2020. The change will remove 3,100 tons of virgin plastic from circulation.

“Our new Smartwater bottle shows we can go further, but that requires more packaging to be collected so that more can be reused to make new bottles,” Woods says. “That’s why we support the planned reforms of the current recycling system in Great Britain and are calling for the introduction of a well-designed deposit-return scheme for drinks containers, which we believe will reduce litter and increase the quantity and quality of material reprocessed in this country.”

McDonald’s U.K. will remove plastic lids from all McFlurry options in September and all single-use plastic packaging for salads will be replaced with “carton board,” which contains 50 percent recycled content.

In total, the removal of plastic lids and single-use plastic salad containers will reduce plastic use by 485 tons per year, the fast food company says in a news release announcing the change.

Salads will be served in 100 percent renewable and recyclable cardboard containers. The coating on the containers, designed to keep them rigid, is also 100 percent renewable, according to the company.

“It’s the latest step in our sustainability journey,” says Beth Hart, supply chain director, McDonald’s U.K. & Ireland. “We are committed to listening to our customers and finding solutions with our suppliers that work for them. This is the latest example of that, but by no means the end.”

In 2018, McDonald’s U.K. announced that it would replace more than 8 billion plastic straws per year with paper straws. The U.K. business operates more than 1,270 restaurants, serving more than 3.7 million customers per day. The changes are part of an “ongoing commitment” to move to more sustainable packaging. Globally, McDonald’s has committed to source all packaging from renewable or recycled sources by 2025.

“We continue to look for solutions for our cutlery and lids, but this is great progress,” Hart says.

PepsiCo Inc., Purchase, New York, has announced that LIFEWTR will be packaged in 100 percent rPET and bubly sparkling water will no longer be packaged in plastic. The company's Aquafina water brand also will offer aluminum can packaging in the United States, while the brand tests the move.

""We are really excited to evolve our packaging across PepsiCo's water portfolio to make a positive impact,"" says Stacy Taffet, vice president water portfolio for PepsiCo.

Order of the Wheel inducts new members



Waterfront Partnership’s Healthy Harbor initiative, which operates the Inner Harbor Water Wheel and provides a road map to clean Baltimore’s harbor of plastics, recently inducted more than 100 community members into the Order of the Wheel, a “secret” society launched in 2018 to carry out environmental action against plastic pollution.

Inductees formally committed to advancing the Inner Harbor Water Wheel project’s mission to rid the world’s waterways and oceans of single-use plastics. To qualify, pledges had to complete five tasks, demonstrating their commitment to a “clean, waste-free environment.”

More than 700 people participated in the second pledge period for the Order of the Wheel, with 155 completing all tasks. More than 30 members were also promoted to “Master Wheelers.”

Order of the Wheel launched with 400 inductees, with a goal of spreading grassroots environmental action against waste pollution. The society was inspired by the thousands of “Mr. Trash Wheel” fans and their dedication to a plastic-free harbor.",United States,2019.06
778,MPs launch inquiry into e-waste and circular economy,"The Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) has launched a new inquiry into the “tsunami” of electronic waste (e-waste) and the UK’s efforts to build a more circular economy.

With the huge increase in the use of electronic devices and equipment in recent years contributing to a growth in e-waste, the nation’s system of dealing with the discarded technologies is being scrutinised.

Globally, 44.7 million tonnes of e-waste were produced in 2017, 90% of which was sent to landfill, incinerated, illegally traded or treated in a sub-standard way.

Europe and the US account for almost half of all e-waste globally, with the EU predicted to produce 12 million tonnes by 2020.

Despite a ban on e-waste exports to developing countries, 1.3 million tonnes of undocumented goods are exported from the EU each year.

The EAC says the UK was ranked as the worst offender in the EU by the Basel Action Network in February and following the report’s findings, the Environment Agency closed down four illegal waste operators.

E-waste can contain up to 60 different metals and chemicals, some of which can be hazardous to human health and the environment, including contaminating soil, polluting water sources and entering food supply chains.

The MPs are seeking written evidence on the steps being taken to move towards a circular economy for electronic goods and how the government can support this, the environmental and human health risk from e-waste as well as the support required to facilitate the adoption of recovery technologies.

They are also inviting views on the cause of fraud in the UK’s e-waste system, the actions government can take to prevent the illegal export of e-waste to the developing world and how recycling can be improved.

EAC Chair Mary Creagh MP said: “Our old fridges, freezers, computers, TVs, kettles and mobile phones are piling up in a ‘tsunami of e-waste’. New phone launches, cheaper goods and built-in obsolescence have contributed to the growth of electronic waste in recent years.

“The UK produces more e-waste than the EU average. We are missing EU targets and are one of the worst offenders for exporting waste to developing countries, who are ill equipped to dispose of it in a socially and environmentally responsible way. Our attitude to e-waste is unsustainable and the need for radical action clear. We will be investigating the UK’s e-waste industry and looking at how we can create a circular economy for electronic goods.”",United States,2019.06
781,MPs to probe UK’s growing e-waste problem,"The cross-party Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) has opened an inquiry into electronic waste, also known as e-waste, and the circular economy, as the number of connected devices in use in the UK continues to increase dramatically and shows no sign of slowing.

The EAC claimed that out of 44.7 million tonnes of e-waste produced worldwide in 2017, 90% of it was either sent to landfill, incinerated, illegally traded or otherwise treated in a sub-standard way.

The UK produces 24.9kg of e-waste per person, nearly 10kg more than the European Union (EU) average, and while previous governments have implemented EU directives on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) into British law, the UK is consistently missing its recycling targets.

Concerns over what happens to rubbish generated within the UK have entered the public consciousness in 2019 following multiple reports that thousands of tonnes of waste plastics that people thought they were recycling in good faith have simply been shipped to other countries and, in many cases, illegally dumped.

These dumping grounds include a number of ASEAN countries such as the Philippines and Malaysia, which has announced plans to return 3,000 tonnes of plastics to countries such as Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the UK and the US, and even Malaysia’s neighbour Singapore.

Besides plastics, e-waste often also contains rare earth elements – rare in the sense of being hard and expensive to mine – such as lithium, tantalum and tungsten – and other chemicals that if dumped in landfill, can easily contaminate local water supplies and food chains and pose a risk to both human health and wider ecosystems.

In some countries, crude recycling and extraction techniques used to recover reusable components within electrical goods pose an additional risk to workers by exposing them to toxins and carcinogens.

The committee cited a recent report produced by environmental groups Ipen and the Basel Action Network, which found that in the Agbogbloshie district of Ghana’s capital, Accra, where as many as 80,000 people work in large-scale e-waste recycling, dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) contained within e-waste from Europe was causing significant impacts.

The report found that one adult eating one egg produced in the area would exceed European Food Safety Authority limits on chlorinated dioxin by more than 200 times.

Chair of the Environmental Audit Committee, Mary Creagh MP, said: “Our old fridges, freezers, computers, TVs, kettles and mobile phones are piling up in a ‘tsunami of e-waste’. New phone launches, cheaper goods, and built-in obsolescence have contributed to the growth of electronic waste in recent years.

“The UK produces more e-waste than the EU average. We are missing EU targets and are one of the worst offenders for exporting waste to developing countries, who are ill-equipped to dispose of it in a socially and environmentally responsible way.

“Our attitude to e-waste is unsustainable and the need for radical action is clear. We will be investigating the UK’s e-waste industry and looking at how we can create a circular economy for electronic goods.”

The EAC is inviting written evidence on a number of questions, to be submitted by the close of business on 17 August 2019.

Among other things, the EAC, which includes the Green Party’s only sitting MP, Caroline Lucas, are asking: what are the risks to the environment and human health from e-waste? What steps are being taken to implement a circular economy for electronics within the UK? How can the secondary markets for used goods be improved and supported? And how the government can support the adoption of technology to aid in recovering precious metals and rare earth elements from end-of-life devices?

The EAC would also like input on current WEEE collection targets, whether or not they are achievable and the challenges processors face in meeting them, the issue of fraud in the e-waste system, the illegal exporting of e-waste to developing countries, and public awareness of the issue.

The committee will ultimately help inform future revisions to the UK’s 2013 WEEE legislation, which the government has committed to undertake by the end of 2020. Westminster has also committed £8m in funding to explore research into changing user behaviour, and expanding local projects that increase reuse and recycling rates.",United States,2019.06
782,IEG: ALL THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY BUSINESS AT ECOMONDO 2019 | Environmental XPRT,"IEG: ALL THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY BUSINESS AT ECOMONDO 2019

FROM 5th TO 8th NOVEMBER AT RIMINI FIERA, ORGANIZED BY IEG, THE LEADING EVENT IN THE EURO MEDITERRANEAN AREA FOR THE NEW GREEN ECONOMY

In the spotlight Italy’s leadership on the bioplastic front, innovation in integrated waste management, integrated wastewater cycle and hydrogeological instability

Rimini (Italy), 25th June 2019 - The leitmotif has been established to link the events and contents of Ecomondo 2019, due to be held from Tuesday 5th to Friday 8th November at Rimini Expo Centre and organized by Italian Exhibition Group.

An edition with a new ad hoc layout for trade and industry members interested in grasping the cross-sectoral industrial symbiosis of green and circular economies. Key players will also include the most authoritative public and private organizations and bodies, who support IEG in the organization of the expo’s strategic contents throughout the year.

Held simultaneously with Ecomondo, Key Energy, for the world of renewable energies, and Sal.Ve, the triennial Waste Vehicle Expo.

Ecomondo 2019 will also host the annual appointment with the States General of the Green Economy, promoted by the National Council of green economy, in collaboration with the Ministry for the Environment and the Ministry of Economic Development, for an analysis and an update on the most topical crucial economic and normative issues.

Leader in the Euro Mediterranean area for circular economy and incubator of innovation for enterprises aiming for new business models, Ecomondo has assumed the role of a platform from which useful plans emerge for new legislation, managing and planning various territories and, above all, doing business according to the green economy, thanks also to the qualified proactive Technical Scientific Committee chaired by Professor Fabio Fava of the University of Bologna.

In Rimini, there will be all the innovative technology for the integrated management and exploitation of material to improve the efficiency of manufacturing processes. The EU’s approval of the Circular Economy Package, followed by its adoption at national level, offers recovery and recycling enterprises the opportunity of facing the challenge of the evolution and transformation from the recycling of waste typical of a linear economy to an established circular economy system.

For Circular Bioeconomy, the spotlight will be on EU regulations aimed atlimiting and eliminating disposable plastic products. A great stimulus for innovation, able to boost the competitiveness of the world market of sustainable products, already rapidly expanding. In recent years, Ecomondo firstly featured case histories, then projects and more recently the extraordinary results achieved by large Italian enterprises at the leading edge worldwide. Leadership in biodegradable compostable bioplastics has ensured the possibility of re-thinking a product that is critical for the environment.

Another expo macro-sector is that of the Remediation of contaminated sites and their consequent requalification, which will feature the participation of the sector’s key players. These are companies that excel in decommissioning activities, for the re-use of Brownfields, abandoned industrial areas, degraded and abandoned districts, in which reclamation, development and reuse currently represent a great challenge. This area will also feature the debut of the new sector on hydrogeological risks, dedicated to systems and solution for prevention and the main climatic risks, such as flooding and coastal erosion.

Lastly, in the area dedicated to the integrated wastewater cycle, with double the exhibit space and the enterprises of the water cycle, from its sourcing to its return to the environment. In the expo area there will also be a focus on the use of water in agriculture, and a seminar on sustainable irrigation held by two member of the Water Technical Scientific Committee, Francesco Fatone (Marches Polytechnic University and International Water Association - IWA) and Attilio Toscano (University of Bologna).

In 2019, Ecomondo will again feature a focus on Italian and international start-ups, in collaboration and with the support of ASTER - Emilia-Romagna Region, the Knowledge Innovation community of the EIT (Climate, Raw Materials and Innoenergy), the University of Bologna and Confindustria Giuseppina Mai Foundation.

Category: International exhibition; Organizer: Italian Exhibition Group SpA; Frequency: annual; Edition: 23rd Ecomondo; Admission: trade members and general public; dates and hours: 5 – 8 November, 9 am – 6 pm; group brand manager: Alessandra Astolfi; brand manager: Mauro Delle Fratte; exhibitor info: tel. +39 0541.744302; e-mail: ecomondo@iegexpo.it; Web sites: www.ecomondo.com;Facebook: www.facebook.com/EcomondoRimini; twitter:http://twitter.com/Ecomondo; LinkedIn:https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8135546/profile",United States,2019.06
783,Borealis and EREMA step up recyclability co-operation,"Borealis, a leading provider of innovative solutions in the fields of polyolefins, base chemicals, and fertilisers; and the EREMA Group, the global market leader in the development and production of plastics recycling systems, have signed a Letter of Intent for the purpose of deepening their co-operation in the field of mechanical recycling.

The shared goal is to advance mechanical recycling technologies in order to accelerate the transition to a circular economy of plastics. The companies also aim to enhance recycling processes in order to satisfy increasing market demand for higher quality recyclate used in high-end applications

EREMA CEO Manfred Hackl said: “We are pleased to have signed this agreement – not only because it is a great step forward for both our companies, but because our intensified co-operation is certain to have a catalytic effect in the transformational process to a circular economy.”

While the ultimate aim of the co-operation is to effect a more rapid transformation to a circular economy, Borealis and EREMA will collaborate most specifically on technologies and processes in mechanical recycling, knowledge exchange, and standardisation, as well as the acquisition of more sophisticated market intelligence.

With headquarters in Ansfelden, Austria, the EREMA Group has more than just a geographical proximity to Borealis’ Austrian operations: the two companies share a deep commitment to leading the way to a more circular economy of plastics.

EREMA has been a global market leader in the development and production of plastics recycling systems and their components. Over 6,000 EREMA systems are now in operation around the globe, producing a total of over 14.5 million tonnes of plastic pellets annually.",United States,2019.06
784,9 Key Takeaways From The Decoded Future London Summit,"Sustainability, a circular economy, and transparency were among the key topics discussed earlier this month at the Decoded Future London summit. Held at County Hall in association with Stylus, a global trends intelligence company, the one-day event brought together executives from various companies in beauty, fashion, hospitality, and technology..

Here’s a roundup of key issues addressed at the event.

1. The fashion industry, consumers and the government, need to do more.

Mary Creagh, Labour MP for Wakefield & Chair, Environmental Audit Committee said ""We as consumers can’t allow fashion companies to hide behind their supply chain… I want fashion to set out its blueprint for a net zero emissions world.”

2. Brands and designers should learn about circularity and sustainable design.

Jane Robson Blanchard, owner of JRB Global Fashion Solutions said ""The problem we have in the fashion industry is we have never been circular. We have this linear model. What we need to do is make it into this circular environment where we start with the design process. We need designers to be educated in the correct way. At the moment, we have very, very limited knowledge in our design schools of circularity and of sustainable design and that needs to change. And obviously, a lot of the designers we have at the moment have never been educated in it. This is a new way of thinking. We need to take the product from design and concept and think about the total life cycle from the consumer journey to the end of life and product reuse or recycle. There's a lot of work to be done in this area.""

Jane Robson Blanchard, owner of JRB Global Fashion Solutions said ""If the top doesn't listen, then Gen X will come through and start demanding it. The next generation is way more demanding. They will push upwards and will ask all these questions. The companies that don't respond won't survive. We can see big retailers fall very fast and there will be pressure from the bottom. So I would suggest to any top CEO of any big company that you need to listen now because you have to prioritize the planet before your profit. If you don't do that, you're not going to have a business in the long-term. Investors and shareholders will start demanding it as well.""

4. Consumers are spending money on experiences over material items.

Hayley Ward, head of Insight Partnerships at Marks & Spencer said “People are prioritizing experiences over things; they’ve become part of our identity. We’re not our possessions, but the accumulation of everything we’ve seen, the things we’ve done, and the places we’ve been. Experiences make us happy. We’re being told more – see the books of Marie Kondo – that we don’t need lots of stuff. Actually, what we need is to declutter and have only the things that really bring us joy. Consumers are prioritizing their wellbeing more than ever.”

5. Small brands can build a more sustainable strategy by creating and following through on strong guidelines.

Miles Johnson, former creative director of product design and development at Patagonia said ""It's an amazing education to have worked for that company. You realize when you're involved with it and embedded into it. They have made a lot of money by not letting making money become the complete focus. They have so many strong beliefs. They have done things on a common sense approach to business and wholeheartedly care about the environment. They have given great guidelines to their employees in the way of a mission statement: 'We are in business to save our home planet.' You know that everything you do as an employee it's a mantra.""

6. Buyers and designers need to be more thorough and ask for certifications and proof from factories and mills.

Rosey Cortazzi, global marketing director at Isko said ""I worked for some of the world's leading brands before Isko and I can hand on heart say that I was trying to do the right thing but I was confused and bamboozled by all this stuff. I was doing certain things like buying certified fiber. I thought I was doing really well, I'm buying organic cotton but I wasn't thinking about the whole process end to end. So that organic cotton could have been made by people not getting paid a living wage and could have been doing awful things with the chemicals and the emissions. So I wasn't thinking about the whole process. Everything we do at Isko is verified by a third party so we don't just say something. So don't be afraid to ask and visit a factory or a mill for the proof. Go and visit and ask questions. Poke your nose in. Ask for the certifications and ask for proof. Because lots of people are saying things but that may not be the case.""

7. The mindset of owning items has shifted for Gen Z and the Millennial set and ownership is not where it used to be.

Clara Chappaz, chief growth officer at Vestiaire Collective said ""Social has pushed resale. This idea of wearing something fresh and being able to share your style and change it on social and was also a driving factor of the boom on resale. It goes along the shifting mindset of the younger generation: Gen Z or the Millennials, where ownership is not where it used to be for the older generation and people are trying to invest in experiences or anything they can share with friends rather than owning things. Resale is a good way to answer this because you can buy and resell. I think around 20 percent of people on Vestiaire buy then resell the products they bought. So you can really see the circularity and the idea that you don't really need to own thing forever anymore. Because you want to keep fresh be on trend and you care more and more about sustainability and you want to be cautious of your behavior.""

Katy Lubin, vice president of communications at Lyst said ""I think in terms of making real change for customers, something that would be super valuable is super transparency and alignment across the industry in how we describe products. So when we find people searching for more sustainable-minded stuff we group terms together like circular, sustainable conscious, responsible and ethical. What is the difference for the customer and how can you pull those stuff out and make it clear would be a powerful step.""

Katy Lubin, vice president of communications at Lyst said ""As a fashion industry, we don't work together on many things. It's not like an open sourced tech community where we are sharing knowledge and insights and learning so I think a big step there would be to come together to make positive change.""",United States,2019.06
785,Circular economy with textile subproducts,"The percentage of footwear and textiles materials that are currently recycled is very low, so there is great potential to increase their recovery. However, current technologies present difficulties, since footwear contains a complex mixture of materials, difficult to separate and with low residual value

One of the possibilities of transforming these products into higher value added modes is the chemical recycling of polymers.

It involves the application of technologies based on solvents, which can be mainly organic, aqueous or ionic liquids. It can be applied to both plastic and cellulose fibers, even to mixtures. In the case of cotton, the technology is already commercially available, while for blends it is still under development.

One of the possibilities of taking advantage of these polymers is the production of membranes. There are different types of techniques to synthesize a membrane, which allow to design a great variety of them with very different characteristics. The choice of the synthesis method depends mainly on the material used and the desired final structure. In the research that we intend to carry out, we propose the phase inversion technique.

Background and State of the Art:

In the Research group there is a wide experience in the production and use of polymer membranes as can be seen in the bibliography section of this document.

With the proposed research, it is intended to start a new research to promote the recycling of a terminal product that is obtained, only in Spain, 600000 tonnes / year.

In the proposed Research, samples of different terminal products of footwear and textiles will be used. The polymer composition will be determined from the manufacturer’s data and a scanning of the capacity of solubilization of polymeric mixtures with different solvents will be made. Then the rheological properties of the solubilized polymers will be determined and, finally, membranes will be produced by the phase inversion technique. The mechanical characteristics and separation of permeability of the membranes produced will be measured.

The ideal candidate should have background in one of the following fields: Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Chemistry (specialization in organic chemistry). Other backgrounds can also be considered.

The candidate must be able to integrate into a research group and must be able to write reports and articles in the English language.

786,ENGEL will exhibit commitment to circular economy at K 2019,"Circular Economy is one of the focus topics at K 2019 and is also the ‘green thread’ running through ENGEL’s K Show appearance.

At K 2019, five exhibits will demonstrate ENGEL’s contribution as an injection moulding manufacturer and system solutions provider.

Its focus will be on processing recycled material, improving process stability, and the trend towards design for recycling.

Günther Klammer, head of the Plasticising Systems division and Circular Economy expert at ENGEL Austria, said: “The stability of the injection moulding processes is key to being able to use recycled materials also for higher quality products.”

“Intelligent assistance opens the door for recycled materials to a far broader range of applications.”

Dr Stefan Engleder, CEO of ENGEL Group, said: “It is my personal concern to contribute to establishing a circular economy for the plastics industry, which bears a global responsibility that can only be met by companies working together.”

“I therefore welcome the focus on Circular Economy at the most important international industry event. K will give this subject even more impetus.”

“Circular Economy is a worldwide challenge with different regional focuses. With our experience from Europe, we can contribute to people taking the first steps towards circular economy in other regions of the world, such as South America or Asia.”

“The closer enterprises cooperate along the value chain, the better this works. As an individual company, we have only limited influence here. The initiative networks the global players and thus gives more voice to our common concern.”",United States,2019.06
787,Circular Economy with ENGEL at K 2019,"Circular Economy is one of the focus topics at K 2019 and also the “green thread” running through injection moulding machine manufacturer and system solutions provider ENGEL's trade fair appearance.

Dr. Stefan Engleder, the CEO of the ENGEL Group, emphasises the huge importance of this topic in the run-up to the trade fair as follows: “It is my personal concern to contribute to establishing a circular economy for the plastics industry, which bears a global responsibility that can only be met by companies working together. I therefore welcome the focus on Circular Economy at the most important international industry event. K will give this subject even more impetus.”

“K 2019 will show what is already possible today and what companies in the plastics industry are working on to close increasing numbers of material cycles,” says Engleder. “Circular economy is an innovation driver.” One of the priority tasks on the way to the circular economy is to open up a broader range of applications for processed plastic waste.

At K 2019, five exhibits at three locations demonstrate ENGEL's contribution as an injection moulding machine manufacturer and system solutions provider. The focus is on processing recycled material, improving process stability, and the trend towards design for recycling.

Greater process stability paves way for wider use of recycled materials

“The stability of the injection moulding processes is key to being able to use recycled materials also for higher quality products,” as Günther Klammer, head of the Plasticizing Systems division and Circular Economy expert at ENGEL AUSTRIA, emphasises. Recycled material is naturally subject to greater batch variations than virgin material. In order to significantly reduce its influence on the process, the intelligent iQ weight control assistance system is being used at ENGEL's stand to process fully recycled ABS. The software from ENGEL's inject 4.0 program ensures a constant melt volume during injection and thus a consistently high product quality, even with strongly fluctuating raw material quality. “Intelligent assistance opens the door for recycled materials to a far broader range of applications,” says Klammer. “Industry 4.0 is an important enabler for the circular economy.”

Increasing the proportion of recycled materials in sandwich-moulded components

One further approach to using recycled materials more widely is sandwich components with a core of recycled material embedded in virgin material. The aim is, on the one hand, to design increasing numbers of products for this type of two-component production, while, on the other, increasing the proportion of recycled material in the sandwich structures. The proportion of recycled material that can be used in the core is essentially determined by the geometry of the moulded part and the flow pattern in the cavity. The transport boxes that ENGEL is producing at its stand using the ENGEL skinmelt process pose a particular challenge in this respect. But despite this complex component geometry, ENGEL still succeeds in achieving a very high level of recycled content of over 50% with the skinmelt process. What is also important is the grade purity “ensuring that the sandwich-moulded products can also be easily recycled at the end of their service life”, as Klammer emphasises. ENGEL is exclusively using polypropylene for the manufacture of the transport boxes; the recycled material here originates from post-consumer collection. ENGEL collaborates with Der Grüne Punkt (The green dot), Duales System Deutschland (DSD, Germany), to this end.

Considering recycling as early as in product development

Designing for recycling means that the subsequent recycling process is taken into account as early as in the development of a new product, and that the requirements of the circular economy and sustainability are taken into account in the product design. Further examples where this is already working well can be found in the packaging industry and in composite lightweight design. In the production of thin-walled packaging in the IML (in-mould-labelling) process, for example, there is a trend towards mono-material systems in which the label and pellets are made of the same material.

Wherever you look in composite lightweight design, thermoplastic-based solutions point the way to the circular economy. In the ENGEL organomelt process, fibre-reinforced prepregs with a thermoplastic matrix such as organic sheets and tapes are overmoulded with a thermoplastic from the matrix material's material group. The entire composite component consists only of thermoplastic and glass fibres and has the potential to be recycled at the end of its useful life. At its stand, ENGEL is demonstrating the production-ready process with a demanding automotive application.

At K 2019, ENGEL is stretching the circular economy lifeline far beyond its main stand. In the outdoor exhibition area between Halls 10 and 16, post-consumer waste is being converted into miniature waste containers on an ENGEL victory injection moulding machine.

Erema's recycling pavilion is located in the immediate vicinity. Another victory machine is producing card boxes from recycled fishing nets there. The polyamide recycled material comes from Chile, where three American machine manufacturers have set up collection points for end-of-life nets. Previously, these nets were often disposed of in the sea due to the lack of available collection infrastructure. In Chile, the nets are recycled on an Erema system and processed into skateboards and sun glasses on ENGEL injection moulding machines. The project proves how interdisciplinary and international interaction can also be used to close material cycles where there are no comprehensive collection systems to date.

“Circular Economy is a worldwide challenge with different regional focuses”, as Stefan Engleder points out. “With our experience from Europe, we can contribute to people taking the first steps towards circular economy in other regions of the world, such as South America or Asia. The closer enterprises cooperate along the value chain, the better this works. As an individual company, we have only limited influence here”, a conviction which is expressed in the Global Commitment to the New Plastics Economy. ENGEL was one of the first plastics machine manufacturers to join the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's initiative last autumn. “The initiative networks the global players and thus gives more voice to our common concern,” says Engleder.",United States,2019.06
789,On the scene at Circularity 19 | Greenbiz,"CEOs at the helm of new business models representing everything from consumer products to water to finance. Experts and analysts in design paradigms, plastic waste and social justice. Founders of startups that foster connections in material health, provide technological solutions for recycling and develop metrics for the circular economy.

Professionals, leaders, financiers and advocates gathered in Minneapolis last week for the launch of the largest circular economy event in North America, GreenBiz Group's Circularity 19. The first-of-its-kind event had sold out a few weeks before it took place, and the energy in the room was palpable.



The question at the heart of the gathering — and front and center on attendees' minds — was, what does a circular economy look like? And what will it take to get us to a system that moves beyond the current linear ""take, make, dispose"" model — a world that maximizes its resources, safely, circularly and justly?

From interviews with tech giants to a packed-house summit on plastics to mainstage announcements of circular commitments to tours of Target, the three days were filled with hands-on interactions and important discussions.

Whether you were among the sold-out crowd, watched virtually from home or caught glimpses on social media, get a taste of some of the action that took place in Minneapolis last week.

GreenBiz Group President and Co-founder Pete May gets mic'ed up backstage before he takes the mainstage at the Minneapolis Marriott to give the Day 2 welcome address. ""It's been really inspiring to see the growth of this area of sustainability,"" he tells the crowd as he takes the stage. ""I've never seen anything like it. Since about nine months ago when we decided that we were going to create the first circular economy event in North America to when we set up our first advisory board meeting held here in Minneapolis, we knew we were onto something ... There's a heat around this topic, and we're so excited to be in the heart of a new market.""

Lauren Phipps, director and senior analyst of the circular economy at GreenBiz Group, addresses the packed room: ""I feel incredibly privileged to be up here. I've been working hard for about the past year for you all to be able to come, and I'm proud of the work we've done here — and the work you all are doing.""

Conference attendees explore and mingle inside of the exhibition hall during breaks and networking events. Old co-workers, new partners, upstart founders, legacy investors, customers and acquaintances all connect and consume with good spirits.

Those with questions about circular topics have the opportunity to break bread and chew the fat directly with experts at roundtable lunches. With conversation topics ranging from ""Industry Trade Associations & the Circular Economy"" to ""Turning Plastic Waste Commitments Into Meaningful Action"" to ""Talking in Circles: Discuss Tech, Trends and Tips with GreenBiz Editors"" (this one co-led by yours truly), the roundtables foster fruitful discussion.

Circularity 19 continues the tradition that started seven years ago at GreenBiz's original VERGE events: a fast-pitch competition for startups with cleantech, clean economic models and clean products. At last week's conference, circular startups pitching ideas from waste data collection to textile recycling to platforms for reusable items were voted on by conference attendees. Pictured here are the winners: Lime Loop, which produces a smart, returnable shipper made of durable, lightweight, waterproof billboard vinyl. 



At the Circularity Lounge, diligent conference attendees could grab a quick, quiet second away from the action to process inspirational information, brainstorm ideas with new connections and/or catch up on emails, if they so chose.

In the mainstage session, ""Power, Privilege and Bias in a Circular Economy,"" (from left) Tawanna Black, CEO of the Center for Economic Inclusion in Minneapolis; Valerie Craig, deputy to the chief scientist and vice president of impact initiatives at the National Geographic Society; and Carrie Freeman, managing partner at SecondMuse, discuss a socially just circular economy.

So how can organizations working towards creating a circular economy make sure that all people are in the loop — and avoid perpetuating current systems that exclude and marginalize? ""Coming in with a level of humility — 'we don't know what is actually happening on the ground' — being very intentional about the way we approach things, being intentional about how we signal, and very intentionally inviting people in,"" Freeman says.

Cupanion was one of over a dozen exhibitors at Circularity 19, but the water bottle company isn't your average hydration station. The company also has an app that tracks how many times you reuse it and donates to clean water projects around the world based on how it's able to divert single-use plastic water bottles from landfills.

As with every GreenBiz conference, GreenBiz partners with waste management companies to ensure that zero-waste policies are implemented and carried through. At Circularity 19, there was a waste diversion rate of 99.8 percent.

Tom Szaky, CEO of TerraCycle, speaks onstage at Circularity 19 to talk about the ""return of the milkman model"" with his company's new Loop initiative to prevent single-use packaging from entering the waste stream. He's an innovative recycling visionary and was a Circularity 19 conference adviser.

The circular economy is more than just reusing materials and products — it's also about regenerating systems that have been degraded in our current linear system. Enter Kernza, a domesticated perennial grain similar to wheatgrass that's being grown by the Land Institute. Its long root system sequesters carbon and can be made into cereal in its current production state. Bonus: It tastes good, too.

Heather Clancy (left), editorial director at GreenBiz, and Sarah Golden, senior energy analyst at GreenBiz, keep virtual audience members entertained with commentary on the conference's content as well as interview in-person attendees. During virtual livestreams, viewers can tweet to GreenBiz with questions for presenters, and the sidebar hosts can ask them during the Q&A portions.

How can we create the cultural conditions that will enable a circular system? Lauren Yarmuth, director of circular economy programs with design firm IDEO, presents to the attendees and discusses what it would take to move the needle.

""We have the opportunity now to reimagine; to rebuild ... At its core, the circular economy is about potential. The potential of a cup, the potential of a nutrient, to stay at play as long as possible. The potential of a city or an ecosystem to realize its full self. And the potential of us — of humans, of our ability to contribute in a meaningful way to the world around us,"" she notes.",United States,2019.06

800,"The Circular Economy Is Great For Real Estate’s Bottom Line, Oh, And The Planet","May Al-Karooni just couldn’t get her head around it.



The office of the investment bank at which she worked was being refurbished, and she asked the facilities management team what was happening to everything that was being ripped out: the fixtures, fittings and furniture. Basically, she was told, the vast majority was being thrown away. It was just the easiest thing to do. 



That has pretty much always been the case at every office, shop, industrial unit and commercial apartment building across the world, for as long as anyone can remember. And it is not just the interiors.

Courtesy of the city of Venlo

From the smallest house to the biggest office building, the tons and tons of glass, steel, wood and concrete from a building demolition or remodel are taken by a contractor to an incinerator. During the original building process for most commercial buildings, if there are materials left over, even if they are unopened and perfectly good, they are often incinerated, Al-Karooni said. 



It is a massive waste of money and resources. And the only reason it happens that way is because it is easy, and because that is the way it has always been done. But that is changing fast. 



Al-Karooni left her comfortable job in banking to set up Globechain, an online platform that allows companies to list materials or furniture that are not needed during a building process, or are being removed during a refit. If anyone wants them, they can have them for free; they just need to come and collect them. Think Freecycle for corporates on a massive scale: It now has 10,000 members offering materials for use, and has diverted 5.1 million kilos from landfill across 200,000 separate interactions from users. 



Globechain is just one example of how the circular economy is starting to gain a foothold in the real estate industry. The implications are huge for the sector. Accenture estimates that the circular economy could unlock about $4.5 trillion of economic growth by reducing resource waste that has become latent in the modern economy. It will have a huge impact on real estate companies’ bottom line, and their environmental impact. 



Both of these things are vital. Construction costs globally have risen, year in, year out — according to consultancy Drees & Sommer, 5% in 2018 — and circular economy principles can help to mitigate that. 



On an environmental level, real estate and the built environment have a huge role to play in combatting the climate change emergency. Drees & Sommer analysed various data sources, including United Nations data, and said buildings produce 33% of global CO2 emissions, consume 40% of global energy, consume 50% of all materials used globally and produce 60% of toxic waste. 



The bad news is, embracing the principles of the circular economy can be complex, and requires a massive change in the way the industry and governments think. The good news is, that complexity is being reduced almost daily, by technology and innovative companies like Globechain. While many of the financial and economic benefits won’t be felt immediately, some of them most certainly are.

First up, what is the circular economy when it comes to real estate? Essentially it is just a fancy way of saying reusing stuff. That can be incredibly complex, like building a new structure so that it can be completely disassembled and every piece of it reused, like the town hall built by the Dutch town of Venlo (get ready to think about the Netherlands a lot: The country is leading the way in this area, and the government has pledged to make the entire Dutch economy circular by 2050). That process is often called “cradle to cradle” and can equally apply to the fixtures, fit-out and furnishings of a building as the actual physical structure.



It can mean renting materials like light bulbs rather than buying them, through a “light as a service” scheme being run by (Dutch) electrical manufacturer Philips. That reduces the cost of buying light fittings up front, and it has incentivised Philips to make products that last longer: If they are leasing them rather them selling them, it costs them more if they have to replace them regularly.

Or it can be as simple as making sure the furniture that is being replaced during an office fit-out is reused by someone else rather than binned. It is all of these things and a lot in between.



“Our clients are very interested, and I could spend all of my time presenting about [the circular economy] and writing thought leadership pieces,” JLL Upstream Sustainability Associate Director Marit van Rheenen said. “But there are a lot of misunderstandings about what it is and what it entails, and that makes it hard for people to jump in.”

Planet Earth Needs Better Buildings, And So Does Your Wallet



Reducing the amount of carbon used in the building of buildings is vital for the health of the planet. When it comes to real estate and sustainability, a lot of the focus is on reducing the greenhouse gas emissions buildings produce when they are operational, via reducing their energy consumption, and this will of course be vital in hitting carbon-reduction goals which are increasingly being enacted around the world.



But reducing the amount of carbon produced in the construction of buildings is also vital: According to the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor, a consortium of European real estate companies, the amount of carbon produced from the construction of the world’s buildings between now and 2050 will be the same as that produced by them once they are up and running.



Concrete is a massive part of that, due to its reliance on cement, which produces about 8% of global CO2 emissions during its manufacture.

Cement production is responsible for 8% of global CO2 emissions.

But circular economy thinking could help reduce this figure. Companies like SmartCrusher are working on technologies that allow concrete to be broken down into its constituent parts, essentially sand, gravel, cement and water. If new cement doesn’t have to be produced, then the emissions from the construction process are reduced massively. New techniques are also allowing cement to be made with up to 10% ocean plastics, creating a partial solution for another great environmental problem.



In the longer term, just reusing the materials that go into constructing a building or fitting it out via cradle to cradle thinking has a environmental and financial benefit.

“It reduces risk,” van Rheenen said. “As virgin materials become more scarce, they become more expensive.”



This is where the environmental benefit and the fiscal benefit merge. It might not be you reusing the materials, but the components of a building made to be taken apart and reused can be sold on.

“As resource scarcity becomes pronounced, being able to identify value in the materials you’ve used becomes a new revenue stream and a point of value for a building,” Hillbreak Senior Consultant Lucy Matchett said.



“Buildings decrease in value,” Drees & Sommer Head of Engineering Marco Abdallah said. “You can temporarily increase the value by renovating it, but at the end of its life, you call the guy from the landfill, and you pay him to take everything away, so it’s a liability. A cradle to cradle building always keeps the value of the raw materials, so at the end of the life of a building there is a still a positive value because we can still sell the parts and materials. If you relate that to the increase in construction costs, you can participate in that growth.”



He used the Venlo town hall as a tangible example: The lender to the building agreed to put a 5% value on the building at the end of its life, rather than zero, an uplift that was reflected in the size of the loan. Regarding the interiors, which are all cradle-to-cradle certified, the suppliers agreed to take them back after 10 years and repay 18% of the original cost. For massive office occupiers like WeWork, which will be refitting hundreds of buildings annually in a few years time, this has a potentially huge saving implication. 



With Globechain, while companies give away materials for free, they can offset the value against tax in the UK, and also don’t have to pay the cost of disposing of materials.

“We are now in the position that we are not having to chase people, they are coming to us,” Al-Karooni said.

Clients include retailers like Arcadia, the UK’s most profitable housebuilder, Berkeley Homes, and huge public sector organisations like the National Health Service.

Philips runs a service where companies can rent rather than buy light bulbs.

As for renting lighting, van Rheenen said this had reduced some clients’ lighting bills by up to 50%, which for large corporate occupiers would be a substantial saving.

Of course, examples like that of Venlo’s town hall are at the moment fairly isolated, and not everyone is going to buy into the theory immediately.

Not Everyone Is A Believer



“When you talk to the head of sustainability they get probably too excited,” EDGE Technologies Chief Executive Coen van Oostrom said, speaking in particular about cradle to cradle building. “Then when you talk to the head of the investment committee and tell him this will be a big advantage in 30 years, he asks, how is that going to benefit my model.”

Buildings like its EDGE Olympic scheme in Amsterdam use circular principles; for this redevelopment, it reused materials such as taking the stone facade and turning it into ground-floor paving. 



“The current model of valuation isn’t built to take this into account,” van Oostrom said. “It is the same as sustainability in general. When we started, people in the investment committee didn’t put a value on it, but now to sell a building that isn’t sustainable is hardly possible. In 10 years the circular economy will have a place at the table, and we think over the long term these buildings will be worth more.”



But as real estate ownership becomes more consolidated and the big companies, particularly pension and sovereign wealth funds, own ever-greater portfolios, then the investment case becomes clearer.

“If you are a developer that is just doing one project in a city, then you might not see the benefit,” Hillbreak’s Matchett said. “If you are a long-term holder thinking in decades, it is different.”



There are practical elements that will hold back the progress of circular economy thinking. JLL’s van Rheenen points out that if a large corporate occupier, for example, wanted to try and utilise the principles throughout its business, the amount of partners that it could work with and do this are still few in number, and doing things at scale makes the biggest difference, but is difficult.

Al-Karooni said the biggest issue she comes up against relates to guarantees: Because materials that go unused in one construction project but are then passed on to a new owner are considered secondhand, they are not covered for insurance and risk liability in the same way, and changes in regulation might be required to facilitate this.

The Human Factor



But the biggest drawback is human behaviour, the understandable difficulty in getting people and companies to change behaviours that have become embedded. 



“You are dealing with behaviour change,” Al-Karooni said. “Companies have to communicate to their contractor, this is how we want to do things now, because it has always been easier and cheaper to just chuck things. But if you just let people use the system, even without any training, they get it. We find people use the system three times and they get it, and never go back [to the old way of doing things].”



EDGE has started introducing materials passports to its new developments, meaning that everything used to build a facility is tagged and logged, meaning it can be reused later. It also allows it to see exactly what is going in to its buildings, the materials used to build the materials as it were, something it did not previously know. It is a fantastically complex process, and puts pressure on a company.



“Sometimes you think, you don’t really want to scratch the surface,” van Oostrom said. “When you do, you realise that we put some pretty weird things in our buildings.”

And delving into all this is challenging in every way, including to the people behind the project.



“It is very difficult to produce buildings that are energy neutral and also use circular processes and are built using truly sustainable materials,” he added. “I already hammer my team to get a building to be energy neutral, and to build things on time and on budget. Their life is already hard, and then I turn round to them and say, now you have to tag everything and you can’t use half the materials in the world and they think, give me a break. That is about human resources as much as financial resources.”



This thinking might seem out of the ordinary now, but society and business can change very quickly. Four years ago, plastic grocery bags were something people complained about, but seemed an immutable part of modern life. Then in 2015 the UK government introduced a 5p-per-bag tariff on consumers that used them and the number given out by supermarkets dropped 85%. There is a social stigma and a financial penalty to being seen using one, and plastic water bottles and non-recyclable coffee cups are next in line. And soon, so will be real estate.



“People focus on the plastic bags they give out, but the supermarket building itself is far worse when it comes to toxic waste,” Drees & Sommer’s Abdallah said. The company estimates that 2020 could be a “tipping point” year when real estate companies that don’t have a sustainability strategy in place start to be punished by both investors and consumers.

804,"Nigerian Project Tackles E-Waste, Promotes Circular Economy | News | SDG Knowledge Hub | IISD","19 June 2019: The UN Environment Programme, the Global Environment Facility and the Government of Nigeria announced an initiative to create a circular system for electronics in Nigeria. The initiative aims to address the negative impacts of current practices in electronics waste management on the country’s environment and the health of its citizens.

Nigeria processes more than half a million tonnes of discarded appliances annually, according to UNEP. In 2017, Nigeria generated 290,000 tonnes of electronic waste, a 170% increase from 2009. In addition, it receives over 60,000 tonnes of used electronics and electrical equipment from other countries through Lagos ports, and an unknown amount enteres Nigeria via land routes from neighboring countries. Over 25% of this e-waste is classified as “dead on arrival—heading straight to dumps or dismantling.” This waste is often burned, releasing heavy metals and toxic chemicals into Nigeria’s air, soil and water.

Approximately 100,000 Nigerians work in the country’s informal e-waste recycling sector, collecting and dismantling electronics to salvage saleable components. These workers are exposed to hazardous chemicals and experience other health challenges, including eye infections, dermatological and respiratory problems, and below-average life expectancy.

To address these environmental and health challenges, the ‘Circular Economy Approaches for the Electronic Sector in Nigeria’ project will bring together the government, private sector and civil society to initiate a self-sustaining circular economy approach for electronics that protects the country’s environment and creates safe employment. The project aims to collect, treat and dispose of over 270 tonnes of e-waste contaminated with persistent organic pollutants (POPs), as well as 30 tonnes of e-waste containing mercury.

The initiative will support the E-waste Producers Responsibility Organization (EPRON) to promote sustainable production and consumption through encouraging producers to assume responsibility for the lifecycle of their products. The project also will support implementation of extended producer responsibility (EPR) legislation, work with the private sector to develop cost-effective value retention businesses, such as disposal systems and recycling for electronic products, and ensure improved working conditions for informal e-waste collectors and recyclers. These actions will contribute to progress on SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), including SDG target 12.4 on achieving the environmentally sound management of chemicals and wastes throughout their life cycle to minimize adverse impacts of human health and the environment.

UNEP highlights the “enormous economic potential” of safe e-waste recycling, noting that there is 100 times more gold in one tonne of e-waste than in one tonne of gold ore. Other valuable and scarce materials, including cobalt and platinum, also can be recovered through efficient and safe recycling.

UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen emphasized that “the environmental and economic benefits of a circular economy are clear.” She described UNEP’s partnership with the Government of Nigeria and GEF as a “positive step in the country’s effort to kickstart a circular electronics systems.” Naoko Ishii, GEF CEO, called for “radically rethink[ing] our relationship with natural resources and key economic systems” to achieve a world without waste. She said this initiative will help bring together actors across the supply chain and across industries to “put this new way of thinking into practice.”

The project is the first demonstration project in area of electronics for the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE). PACE was launched during the 2018 World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting to drive public-private action on the circular economy. The long-term ambition of the circular electronics project in Nigeria is that a single model is created for application in Nigeria, which would then be replicated across other countries in Africa.

809,10 takeaways from Circularity 19 | Greenbiz,"It was, by all measures, a success: a high-energy, sold-out event attended by passionate professionals seemingly aching to become a community. Last week in Minneapolis, they did just that.

That’s my take on our recent Circularity 19 conference, where 850 souls came together for North America’s largest circular economy conference to accelerate their work to create products, services, companies and economies that keep molecules safely and perpetually in motion.

If you weren’t able to join us, you can still catch a replay of the three days of mainstage action via the free virtual platform. And there’s always next year, May 18-20 in Atlanta.

Here, in no particular order, are 10 takeaways from the week — a few sips from the firehose of insights that spewed from keynotes, breakouts, tutorials, expo booths, networking events and a half-day summit.

Plastic waste is Americans’ No. 1 environmental concern, according to Shelton Group polling. Indeed, it has surpassed climate change as their principal worry. Equally important, ""plastics in the ocean"" is the environmental issue Americans feel they actually can do something about. ""Can your brand help concerned consumers kick the single-use plastics habit?"" asked Suzanne Shelton. She suggested that corporate inaction could put brand loyalty to the test and leave customers frustrated and discouraged.

Large companies are beginning to step up in big ways. More than four in 10 conference attendees hailed from companies with over $1 billion in annual revenue. Several announced circular economy initiatives or provided updates on previous ones:
• Google said it had set a goal to maximize the reuse of finite resources across its operations, products and supply chains and enable others to do the same. ""Waste is a data problem,"" said Kate Brandt, the company’s chief sustainability officer. ""What if we saw stuff as information? This is an inspiring question to us at Google. We love a good data challenge.""
• Best Buy, which says it has collected 2 billion pounds of e-waste, regardless of where it was purchased, said it has deputized its 20,000 Geek Squad tech-support reps, who repair 5 million items a year, to collect electronics from clients’ homes for recycling. ""We really want those products to stay in use as long as possible, and this extends to our repair business,"" said Alexis Ludwig-Vogen, Best Buy's director of corporate responsibility and sustainability.
• 3M announced it was joining the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s CE100 Network, a group of leadership companies seeking to learn and build new collaborative approaches to circularity.
• Apple reported on its circularity goals. ""We have to go material by material and close those loops,"" said Sarah Chandler, senior director of operations and environmental initiatives. ""Our ambition to end mining is as big as anything we've undertaken at Apple, and it's inspired some of our most innovative solutions.""

It’s not just tech. At Circularity 19, we heard from companies taking ambitious and innovative measures toward circularity from food and agriculture, hospitality, apparel and footwear, retail, water and other sectors. For example, Fashion for Good managing director Katrin Ley joined C&A CSO Jeffrey Hogue and Cradle-to Cradle co-founder Bill McDonough on stage to talk about the challenges and opportunities of designing apparel from materials that safely can be turned back into new materials or compost. General Mills and Pepsico talked about innovations to increase agricultural yields while reducing or eliminating food waste.

For all the environmental good that comes from reducing waste, resource use, energy and emissions, a circular economy offers other benefits to companies. For example, for Target, circularity goals have helped increase employee engagement, while at 3M they have improved recruiting, innovation and collaboration opportunities with partners and customers. Indeed, for some it’s not even about sustainability. Ellen MacArthur Foundation CEO Andrew Morlet described how his company avoids using the S-word. Talking instead about ""economy"" opens more conversations, he said. ""It’s about creating wealth versus extracting wealth.""

We need metrics. The acceleration and mainstreaming of circularity will require standards and metrics that don’t yet exist, although some are in the works. For example, Bill Hoffman, senior sustainability scientist at the standards organization UL, discussed a new white paper (PDF) from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and UL showing how a mass-balance approach to content measurement provides a way for companies to measure and communicate their recycled content efforts. Lots more to come on that front.

There’s a generational divide. Younger consumers cotton more naturally to circularity. ""The research is telling us that 50 percent of millennials and Gen Z will participate in the resale economy next year,"" said Yerdle CEO Andy Ruben. His panel, which included execs from Arc'teryx and REI, reported that designing for durability, repair and rental is paramount to the survival of business models, as millennial and Gen Z consumers step into their purchasing power.

It’s the infrastructure, stupid. Pretty much anyone who discussed recycling lamented the sorry state of recycling in the United States and around the world. Many recycling systems are in need of repair, if they exist at all. Solving the infrastructure challenges — including building new ones in Asia, where the lack of such systems has led to waterways spilling over with plastic waste — will be one of the biggest hurdles ahead. Without companies’ ability to capture waste and put it back into production, closing the materials loop will be all but impossible.

It’s not just about closing the loop. While recycling still dominates most conversations about circularity, there’s a lot more to the topic than that, as the Circularity 19 program and speakers made clear. ""We will not recycle our way out of this problem,"" said Kate Davenport, co-president of Eureka Recycling. Conversations and session — mainstage and breakout — looked at recommerce, reuse, remanufacturing, repair, reverse logistics and the other ""re's"" of circularity.

Circularity must be inclusive. The closing mainstage session focused on ""Power, Privilege and Bias in a Circular Economy,"" an acknowledgment that the emerging circular economy needs to benefit those at every rung of the economic ladder, including those in marginalized and frontline communities. That means creating not just opportunities, but actual wealth from circularity for entrepreneurs and communities of all stripes. Said Tawanna Black, CEO of Twin Cities-based Center for Economic Inclusion: ""We must invite everyone to the table to speed up the outcomes we need — for both our local communities and the global economy.""

There’s lots more innovation to come. At Circularity 19, we heard from more than a score of startups offering recycling logistics, reusable shipping containers, textile recycling, alternatives to single-use food packaging, a nature-inspired surface design platform, reusable cups, a biomimicry-inspired insulation grid and many other promising innovations. These and hundreds of other great ideas, including some from larger companies, will be key to moving the field forward.

That’s just a taste. Lots more to glean from all those conversations and connections. Feel free to tune into the archived livestream and our continued coverage of these topics.

And, as I said, there’s always next year.",United States,2019.06
810,Circular cities of the world: What can green infrastructure do?,"More than half of the world's population currently lives in cities while projections show an increase to two thirds by 2050. Many people living in small areas means large amounts of waste, high resource consumption and loads of energy use. We can combat these issues with the ideas behind the circular economy.

If we were to envision our cities as circular cities, how would they look? Green. And why? Because achieving a circular economy means using nature as a template. With the help of green infrastructure, we can take nature as the example and transform our cities into circular cities.

Green infrastructure is a planned network of natural and semi-natural areas in urban areas strategically designed to solve problems with storm water management, heat stress, air quality and biodiversity, to name just a few examples. Urban trees, green roofs and facades and constructed wetlands are some common examples.

Achieving a circular city means ensuring the mitigation of waste. Green infrastructure reduces waste in the construction industry by increasing the longevity of exterior surfaces. With greening, roofs survive longer against harmful weathering and intense sunlight. The lifespan of conventional flat roofs can even be doubled with greening. As one city with a long tradition of greening roofs, Berlin even has green roofs reaching approximately 100 years in age.

Green facades also play a similar role by reducing the maintenance requirements of conventional facades due to the protective layer against sunlight and high temperatures. By using these nature-inspired measures in green infrastructure, cities reduce waste in the construction industry and become more circular. Making our buildings last longer means less waste and helps us approach the idea of circular cities.

One of the key roles that green infrastructure plays for cities is in the management of storm water. When it rains, storm water runs off sealed surfaces and is conveyed to wastewater treatment plants. During heavy rainfall events, the treatment plant's capacity may be exceeded. This can cause combined sewer water and storm water to flow directly into rivers, severely degrading the quality of the water.

Although newer sewer systems allow for the separate conveyance of storm water directly into the rivers, the runoff from streets and sealed surfaces still washes pollutants down to the rivers as well. Green infrastructure reduces the amount of runoff to rivers by acting like a sponge. In Brooklyn, New York, a ""sponge park"" will help clean up the long-polluted Gowanus Canal. In China, the ""sponge city initiative"" focuses on helping cities to absorb more rainwater to mitigate flooding, increase the water supply and reduce pressures on the municipal treatment systems. Reducing and reusing runoff not only mimics nature's own circular way of dealing with rainwater, but also reduces energy consumption at the wastewater treatment plants.

Many cities have already taken great strides in addressing storm water in a circular fashion. In Berlin, for example, one section of Potsdamer Platz with 30,000 square meters features an entire system of connected green roofs, urban spaces, and a constructed treatment pond for handling storm water. By naturally treating water in the pond, very little energy is needed to clean the water, which is then reused for irrigation and flushing toilets. Toronto has even made green roofs obligatory since 2009 in order to manage storm water, and Malmö's Bo01 Development even incorporates 100% renewable energy while also handling and treating all the storm water sustainably.

Reducing energy consumption at treatment plants is just one way in which green infrastructure can aid in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. Green roofs and facades act as an extra source of insulation and protection against temperature extremes: reducing indoor temperatures in the summer and increasing temperatures in the winter. As 40% of the total energy consumption in the EU can be attributed to the building sector and over a third of greenhouse gas emissions originate from buildings, reducing the heating and air conditioning could play a large role in cities' efforts to mitigate climate change.

Besides reducing energy consumption and subsequent greenhouse gases, green roofs and facades also sequester carbon dioxide and assist in the uptake of air pollutants such as nitrous oxide, sulphur oxide a … d particulate matter, the pollutants for which the guidelines from the World Health Organization are often not reached in cities.

To top it all off, greened surfaces are appealing. People enjoy seeing more green in their direct environment, which is crucial for those primarily residing and working in built-up urban environments. Studies have shown that looking out over greened surfaces reduces recovery time of patients in hospitals and reduces psychological stress and depression of workers in urban environments.

Furthermore, increasing the green in cities combats the urban heat island effect and protects human health. For example, at Potsdamer Platz, the summer temperatures are kept 2°C cooler than other surrounding areas.

Considering the numerous benefits, it is clear that cities investing in green infrastructure become more circular and tackle several issues at once. Studies have already shown how economically the benefits do outweigh the costs of such systems, and it is obvious that there is much to gain in mimicking nature and transitioning to circular cities of the world.

811,"A circular city remains a destination of the future, but many are traveling there | Greenbiz","Cities can be carbon-emitting beasts, but they’re also hotspots for innovation and political action. Efforts to create circular cities laser-focus systemic change at the local level, seeking to reinvent urban centers as living demonstration projects of sustainability at scale.

A circular city, in a short definition, is one that eliminates waste, keeps goods and their ingredients in use and regenerates natural systems.

The Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s longer description of a circular city names new possibilities for designing, planning, manufacturing and accessing goods, buildings and vehicles, and keeping materials in use. This can involve more distributed ways of managing resources, including exchanging or renting goods instead of buying them. It involves reverse logistics to bring materials back into consumer flows instead of banishing them as waste. Ideally, businesses and consumers ultimately will discard nothing and share more, at no cost to their convenience and liberty.

The circular economy is beginning to take off primarily because it makes business sense — but also because it engages communities, Ashima Sukhdev, the government and cities program lead for the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, said at Circularity 19 in Minneapolis last week.

That’s good news, considering the exponentially negative trends in natural systems in recent decades — biodiversity loss, carbon emissions, population growth and so on. Cities are major culprits in many of these forces, as they concentrate so many people and materials. Globally, cities take up just 3 percent of land, but generate up to 80 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, consume 75 percent of resources and by 2050 could hold 70 percent of the world’s population.

The circular economy is beginning to take off primarily because it makes business sense — but also because it engages communities. To date, no circular city has a visible dot on a map, despite Copenhagen, London, New York City and Rio de Janeiro being among the dozen inaugural members of the Ellen MacArthur Fund Circular Cities network launched in 2016. There’s no such thing as flipping a circular switch. For now, circularity is not yet a destination but a process, and the earliest circular city efforts focus on proof-of-concept pilots, community hubs and education centers — sometimes all rolled into one.

However, the solutions to so many exponential problems can grow at breakneck speed, according to Eva Gladek, CEO and founder of Metabolic, which helps cities around the world with circular transformations. Speaking at Circularity 19, the molecular biologist by training said the exponential growth of E. coli bacteria in a lab inspired her to invest in a new hope: that circularity, too, will take off.

Bend those exponential growth curves and you can create new forms of prosperity, she said.

A 2017 report by Google and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation laid out the technology accelerants: asset tagging; geospatial data; big data; and connectivity among both people and products.

Among some notable circular efforts in cities:
• None In Las Vegas, Yalmaz Siddiqui, VP of sustainability at MGM Resorts International, described at Circularity 19 how the company flash freezes unused food from restaurant kitchens for use in city food banks and beyond; empty oyster shells travel back to the Chesapeake Bay to support oyster habitats.
• None In Amsterdam, the DeCeuvel former shipyard was reinvented as a ""playground for sustainable technologies,"" drawing tens of thousands of visitors each year. The work and event site’s demonstration of circularity includes solar power and the use of phytoremediation, by which plants sip and transform pollution from the soil.
• None In Chicago’s former meatpacking district (considered a food desert despite housing some of the city’s hottest restaurants), a former pork processing plant dubbed the Plant features 20 food-based businesses that use each others’ waste. Spent grain from a brewery helps to grow mushrooms later sold at a farmer’s market. School groups can learn about the life cycle of a salad or about aquaponics in the Closed Loop lab.
• None In North Carolina, a core feature of the Circular Charlotte plan is the Innovation Barn, a community center set to open this year with a zero-waste restaurant that displays food being processed. It also will host a materials innovation lab for businesses.
• None Google, Ellen MacArthur Foundation and Arup teamed up on a Circularity Lab in New York City and the San Francisco Bay area, focusing on buildings.

These circular experiments and aspirations, however, come at a time when more municipalities are giving up on the simple recycling of cans and bottles. If cities can’t even get something as straightforward as aluminum and glass recycling right, how will they transition to a circular model of how people engage with everything from buildings to clothing to food?

So, in which cities are circular, holistic visions being implemented from the streets to the policymakers and back? Brussels, Belgium, is among the few cities leaning in that direction. The capital of the European Union is in its last year of its four-year Be Circular effort, which involved more than 220 companies working to rethink buildings and construction, shopping, logistics, food and waste. Peterborough, England, aims to become a circular city by 2050.

Yet a Rubik’s Cube analogy applies: Twist the location of a single square, and it scrambles other sides of the cube. Similarly, one aspect of a city can’t shift without taking all the other parts into account. Systems need to be approached holistically.

""Are you working at the areas at the highest levels that you can?"" Gladek asked, emphasizing the importance of design. ""Are you making sure the actions you are taking are not creating consequences elsewhere?""

Something as mundane as waste collection can’t be redesigned without taking into account the social impacts. The Circular Charlotte (PDF) effort, for instance, engaged a wide swath of stakeholders including business leaders and homeless people. When it sought for the project to eliminate organic waste, it thought about ways to focus on upward mobility for residents and create opportunities for the disadvantaged.

Lauren Yarmuth is circular economy director at IDEO, the design firm working with urban planning company Gehl on circular city efforts. She explained at Circularity 19 that just as circularity is about the potential of some thing, such as a cup, bottle or nutrient ""to stay at play as long as possible,"" it’s also about the potential of a city, ecosystem or person to realize its full self.

Yet without an intact cultural fabric, we’ll have a hard time shifting toward circularity because there will be nothing to hold it in place, she said. Individualism, so deeply ingrained in our society, interferes with redesigning, reimagining and reinventing connected systems and communities.",United States,2019.06
813,Calling Innovators To Join The Circular Economy Challenge,"Innovators are invited to enter a Circular Economy Challenge, one of MIT’s “Solve” initiatives, as part of a growing push towards products that generate zero waste with minimal environmental impact.

Many people would still remember the days when things were made to last, items were mended if they broke, and clothes fashions lasted longer than one season.

Slowly but surely, a mounting obsession with consumerism has replaced prudence with an extravagant throwaway culture, resulting in an unfathomable amount of trash: more than two billion tons of solid waste are created globally every year, weighing about five times more than all the people on the planet.

Not only does the waste have an enduring, destructive impact on waterways and ecosystems, but the endless production of cheap plastics, electronics and fast fashion is also accelerating climate change and poisoning life with chemicals, dyes, microplastics and fibers and seeping landfills. The biggest culprits are the wealthy economies; the supply chains serving the richest 10% of the planet are driving 50% of carbon emissions.

If we don’t take urgent action, these practices are simply going to destroy the Earth as we know it.

This realization, fuelled by escalating consumer concern, is driving businesses to find multi-level solutions for circular economies with zero waste. In support, MIT’s Solve initiative is calling for innovators to submit their sustainable solutions before July 1, 2019.

The leading question is, “How can people create and consume goods that are renewable, repairable, reusable and recyclable?” Generating these solutions, Solve proposes, “will require changes in product design and business approaches that have ripple effects throughout supply chains and economic systems.”

They are looking for equitable ways to create circular supply chains by shifting business models away from frequent purchasing towards sustainable solutions that include using recycled raw materials for products and packaging and designing clothes and electronics that are recyclable or biodegradable.

Ideas that help communities move towards zero waste and zero carbon through STEM education on new design and production techniques could win the GM Circular Economy Prize.

This is sponsored by General Motors, one of a growing number of major companies committed to eco-friendly practices and mindful of the opportunities.

“We believe that a sustainable mindset and focus on environmental, social and governance issues drive long-term value,” says the leader of GM’s engineering operations, Ken Kelzer.

“We are experiencing more change in the auto industry today than in the past 50 years,” but the demand is growing faster than the talent, he says. “GM is focussed on supporting STEM education because it’s not just crucial to the future of our workforce, it’s an important way to help our communities attract and keep good jobs.”

Two categories will reward solutions driven by artificial intelligence, sponsored by the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, who seek to improve people’s lives through neuroscience research and information technology, Schmidt Futures, a philanthropic venture dedicated to advancing collaborative science for public benefit, and Innospark Ventures.

Another category, funded by the Vodafone Americas Foundation, calls for innovations that improve quality of life for women and girls. This reflects the recognition that equity is critical for sustainable supply chains, a key target promoted also by the World Bank. They alone have invested $4.7 billion since 2000 to help countries develop solid waste management programs, recognizing that it's significantly more economically viable than the costs of cleaning the mess up.",United States,2019.06
814,Future without landfill is not far away,"Today it is much easier to just dump your waste than to segregate or process it and bring it back to the life cycle. Circular economy is an alternative to the traditional linear economy (take, make, dispose of) in which resources are reserved for as long as possible, extracting maximum value from them whilst in use and then recover and regenerate products and materials at the end of each service life.

On 17 and 18 June 2019, FICCI organized a conference titled ‘3rd Edition of Circular Economy Symposium 2019’ with an objective to discuss and take action on circular economy. In an opening remark Anirban Ghosh, chairman, FICCI Working Group on Circular Economy and chief sustainability officer, Mahindra talked about how the current edition of the symposium aims to enrich the ecosystem of circular economy that encompasses research bodies, the government, regulatory bodies, industry experts and the people.

The conference started with a keynote address by Amitabh Kant, chief executive officer, Niti Aayog, Government of India. He stated, “By 2050, the world population would reach 9.7 billion of which 3 billion people would prosper to middle class consumption level. This would require 71% more resources per capita, thereby raising the total mineral and material demand from 50 billion tons in 2014 to 130 billion tons in 2050.”

Resource circularity being a key technological innovation that can reinvent the life of a product, Kant stressed the need for legislation to promote circular economy in the country. “Several countries have recognized the centrality of circularity as a new paradigm for sustainable development. They have not only embraced the concept of circular economy in their daily life but also brought in strict regulations to ensure higher compliance and promote more reuse, refurbishment and recycling,” he said, adding, “Circular economy has the potential to create 1.4 crore jobs and lacs of new entrepreneurs in the next 5-7 years.”

According to him, developing a circular economy model is linked to the robust ecosystem of the recycling industry.

Global leaders shared their favorable business environment for circular economy business models. Harry Lehmann, Federal Environment Agency, Germany said, “Developing circular economy is not just looking into the whole circle, but also treating each part as equally important.” He underlined the importance of proper design in circular economy. Hiroshi Tachikawa, Propharm, Japan explained the approach they follow for circular economy and added how the concept of a circular economy is not a new one in Japan as they have been practicing this concept for many years now.

The session on technology (physical, biological and digital) as an enabler for circular economy enlightened the audience about the role of technology in order to foster efficient use and help to close the material loop by providing logistics, availability and condition of the product. Abhishek Deshpande, founder, Recykal lent an insight into his company and its services. He said, “We provide digital full-service waste and recycle-enabling technology that focus on sustainability by connecting generators, processors and recyclers. Our technology assures 100% transparency and traceability in supply chains.”

Plastic has become an integral part of the value chain because of its user-friendly properties such as low cost, light weight, high strength and durability. That is why it is being widely used in various industries. However, the increased demand for plastic has also raised a few concerns over plastic waste management. During the session on circular plastics and packaging, industry experts shared their thoughts on the issue, provided various solutions to manage plastic waste and stressed on the need to opt for circular business models.

Circular economy is the way forward

India being one of the fastest growing economies, the country has a dual responsibility that entails managing growth ambitions while being cognizant of rapidly rising resource challenges. Ashutosh Sharma, secretary – Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India, stated in his valedictory address, “Recycling does not only make sense in terms of societal well-being of the future generations but there ought to be good business models that produce opportunities even for the present generation.” He mentioned that the Department of Science and Technology has come up with several schemes in the last couple of that encourages sustainable development.

The symposium concluded with an award ceremony, where awards were given to organizations and individuals in India that have made notable contributions and brought in a change. ACC, Dell International Services India, Geetanjali Woollens, Ecoware Solutions, Saahas, Govardhan Ecovillage, Kabadiwala Connect, and Recykal, winners and runners-up of India Circular Economy Award also gave presentations of their business model and products.",United States,2019.06
818,3 lessons from recommerce pioneers | Greenbiz,"As companies begin to take reuse seriously, an increasing number of consumer goods companies are building ""recommerce"" businesses around taking back used items and reselling them to consumers interested in secondhand goods.

""We’ve been obsessed about this space for about 10 years, and what’s exciting now is this space is showing up,"" said Andy Ruben, founder and CEO of Yerdle, a resale company that powers the back end of about 85 percent of the brands that include recommerce in their business models. He spoke last week at the Circularity 19 conference in Minneapolis.

Recommerce is more than just a sustainability opportunity; it’s also a business opportunity grounded in circular economic principles. Ruben cited a Wells Fargo report estimating that circularity — the notion that brands must consider the full lifecycle of the products they sell — and recommerce will cause $50 billion in market disruption over the next three years. The secondhand apparel market alone is projected to more than double in size by 2023 to $51 billion, according to a report from secondhand clothing seller ThredUp.

Consumer goods brands are discovering an opportunity in following the road paved by pioneers such as ThredUp and The RealReal, which targets the luxury resale market, Ruben said. Two of those companies shared at Circularity 19 some lessons they have learned in implementing their own recommerce programs.

In a world where younger consumers demand more from the brands they interact with, both agreed that recommerce is central to survival for the consumer goods sector. That’s especially true given the importance younger generations place on sustainability and equity issues. About 30 percent of millennials and members of Generation Z will participate in resale or rental transactions this year and that will rise to half next year, according to Ruben.

One in every three customers for outdoor retailer REI’s rental and recommerce business is a millennial, said Peter Whitcomb, director of new business development and the circular economy, in conversation with Ruben. ""We don’t want to give up our customers and members’ closets and garages,"" he said. ""We see used and potentially recyclable goods as levers of growth and retention and acquisition for us.""

REI has three lines of business included in its recommerce initiative: resales of used gear, both online and at physical garage sales; rentals of outdoor gear at 127 locations; and experiential centers that are separate from stores and offer both rentals and experiences such as climbing or kayaking classes.

Given the complexities and challenges involved in building a recommerce business, it’s important to put a strong team in charge. ""Having a dedicated project manager was really key to our launch,"" said Karen Campbell, who works on strategy and new ventures as global commercial business controller for Arc’teryx, an outdoor equipment and apparel company, and who also spoke on the panel. Just two days earlier, Arc’teryx launched its Rock Solid buyback program to take in, clean, repair and resell lightly used outdoor gear.

""There’s so many functions involved, there’s so many ways that this kind of program can go,"" added Campbell. ""Having someone who can speak all the languages, all the functions, and really keep focused on that minimum viable product to get it live and get it going and take the learnings and evolve from there was really important.""

Tip 3: Don't go it alone

Partnering with service providers who specialize in product takeback and turnaround can smooth the process for brands interested in launching recommerce programs. ""The unifying principle around circular commerce is you take the product back with intent,"" Whitcomb said. ""As soon as you have the product back within the system, the operational mechanics of repairing it, pricing it, fulfilling it are really, really complex and not necessarily the core competency of a retail brand.""

Even with great partners and project managers, though, the types of programs REI and Arc’teryx are building may not be right for all retailers. ""You have to have durable quality product to begin with,"" Campbell noted. ""We have a design ethos that really celebrates durability and timeless designs, and we know that there’s equity in our product that wasn’t being realized.""

With recommerce programs, both brands and consumers are starting to realize that value.",United States,2019.06
819,Solving The Plastic Problem,"It was my great pleasure to attend Circularity 19 -- the largest circular economy conference in North America -- held last week in Minneapolis. The two and a half days I spent in Minnesota offered me the chance to speak with some smart and inspirational entrepreneurs, ask questions to executives at SABIC, Dow, General Mills, Apple, and 3M about what large companies are doing to move toward a sustainability, and learn about everything from clothing recycling to regenerative agriculture.

Many people at the conference were talking about plastic – arguably the most important material in today's consumer economy. Plastic is a modern wonder – lightweight, flexible, and tough – perfect for holding everything from carbonated drinks to frozen dinners to houseplants. The big problem is the waste created after its use – a problem I mentioned in the article Feeding the World With Plastic.

According to one of the conference speakers from the National Geographic Society, nine million tons of used plastic finds its way to the ocean every year, collecting into enormous floating islands, being eaten by ocean animals, and breaking down into microparticles that find their way into our food.

By the year 2050, humans will have manufactured 50 billion tons worth of plastic – most of it only used a single time before being discarded. Only a small proportion of the plastic will be recycled, a proportion that may be getting smaller now that China halted imports of waste plastics.

Because of the negative effects on the natural world, plastics are a big concern of environmental groups, and I was surprised to hear that none other than World Wildlife Fund (WWF) has researchers working on the issue. The WWF sent a team to the Circularity conference, and I got the chance to speak with one of the members, Ms. Alix Grabowski, who serves as the WWF’s Lead Specialist for Sustainability R&D.

Even though Ms. Grabowski’s specialty is bioplastics, I was surprised and happy to hear her say “Just because something says ‘bio’ doesn’t mean it is good for the environment.” She emphasized to me that understanding the system consequences of an entire value chain must be taken into consideration when talking about sustainability and circularity.

This systems perspective is formalized across WWF programs like the Bioplastic Feedstock Alliance (BFA) and the Cascading Materials Vision. The essence of these programs is to find opportunities to continuously improve the process of materials sourcing and product and packaging design to create plastic consumption efficiencies that cascade through the consumer value chain.

Real world examples of the operationalization of BFA and the Cascading Materials Vision are as numerous as they are impressive.

For instance, as a result of the WWF program, Ford found a way to use recycled materials and bioplastics to create lightweight automobile trim material. This initiative not only reduces the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with mining hydrocarbons and refining them into plastic, but also decreases GHG emissions due to the cars’ higher fuel efficiency. Another excellent case is the development of Coca-Cola’s PlantBottle containers – which use plant-based plastics.

I also enjoyed meeting the founding team of a materials company based in Israel, UBQ Materials, and their executive team. UBQ, whose founding board member is also the founder of Sabra Hummus, manufactures a novel bio-based plastic material that uses raw food and organic waste as its primary feedstock.

UBQ’s process take household garbage and, through a patented conversion process, turns it into fully functional material that can be used in the manufacturing of durable products – such as deck material – and molded and extruded plastic parts – such as garbage cans or plastic pipes.

What’s more, UBQ’s team told me that their plastic products actually serve to permanently sequester carbon emissions – creating a sustainable thermoplastic material that is not just low-carbon or carbon-neutral, but carbon-negative.

The company is now working in expanding its operations commercial operations in the USA and in Europe.

The last company that caught my eye was SABIC – Saudi Basic Industries Company – the third largest chemical company in the world that recently announced it would be acquired by oil giant Saudi Aramco.

The reason SABIC caught my eye is that I know they have a joint venture with an English firm called Plastic Energy to create a ""chemical recycling"" plant in the Netherlands that will turn plastic from a linear economic source of waste to a circular economic renewable resource.

The essence of the chemical recycling of plastic is different from the ""mechanical recycling"" that most people know. Mechanical recycling is the process of cleaning, chopping, and melting down of used plastic to create uniform plastic pellets that can be melted down with virgin plastic and reformed into a new plastic good.

Chemical recycling through a process known as pyrolysis heats plastic under pressure in an anaerobic environment in a way that breaks the plastic down into its component hydrocarbons. The result of this process is plastic feedstock – undistinguishable from that coming out of a refinery – ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel, and several other useful industrial products.

In a sense, chemical recycling would be the equivalent to taking used paper and, rather than making cardboard out of it, turning it back into raw timber.

Pyrolysis is not a new technology – Chinese firms have converted used car tires to fuel and kerosene for years – but the process can be dirty and difficult when different types of plastics are mixed together. There were several good programs at the conference dealing with chemical recycling, and there are some big names in the chemicals business, including SABIC and Dow, that are looking at ways to improve the commercial potential of pyrolysis.

Even though plastic was a topic on many people’s lips during the conference, I also learned about some fascinating innovations in the recycling of paper and fabric fibers. I’ll cover those discussions in my next article.

I was happy to attend this conference, talking to people who know, as I do, that the only way to build and maintain intergenerational wealth during this century will be by investing in a new paradigm. Intelligent investors take note.",United States,2019.06
822,A Fresh Perspective on Recycling Responsibility | NRCM,"Municipalities and taxpayers in the United States have been footing the bill for recycling programs for too long. It is a funding model that is rooted in a time when our wastes were much simpler. The problem today is that our waste stream is more complex than it has ever been. It is filled with high-tech materials that are not made locally. Materials that are loaded with chemicals and that don’t biodegrade. As a result, we are trying to manage waste in an outdated way. It is hurting our environment and our communities, and keeping our recycling rates low.

We need to reform the way we manage the nation’s complex waste stream, and thankfully we can look to other countries for an effective solution. Many countries around the world such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, all 28 countries in the EU, and Russia, use a system called Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for packaging. EPR is a state of the art policy solution that has helped boost their recycling rates well above 50% and encouraged corporations to develop more environmentally responsible products.

EPR policies are effective at dealing with complicated waste materials because they give the manufacturers a financial stake in making sure recycling programs are robust. Maine already has eight successful EPR policies for hard-to-manage products like batteries, mercury thermostats, mercury auto switches, paint, mercury lamps, electronic (“e-waste) waste, cell phones, and beverage containers.

Using an EPR model for recyclable materials makes sense because the power to fix the problems with our recycling economy largely lies with governments and large brand owners. Consumers and taxpayers have little choice or control over the recyclability of the packaging materials that accompany the products they must purchase.

Under the current system, brand owners and the producers of packaging benefit greatly because taxpayers fund 100% of local recycling programs. These companies are free to sell any kind of product into our economy without taking any responsibility for helping communities manage the product at the end of its life. Brand owners will say that they are voluntarily helping communities by setting environmental goals for their businesses, but experience shows that self-imposed goals often fall short and don’t make a meaningful impact. It is time brand owners get involved and help us manage the waste products they profit from.

The amount of waste polluting our lands and waters grows every day. The plastic pollution crisis is a direct result of poorly managed recyclables and wasteful packaging design. We need to take bigger steps and fix the fundamental flaws in the way we plan for recycling to avoid irreversible effects of excessive waste.

You can make a difference by joining NRCM in supporting Recycling Reform for Maine by getting involved in our campaign to make it more effective, more sustainable, and more equitable. Sign our petition or visit our Recycling Reform website to learn more.

It’s time to think about waste in a new way; to see that our waste and recycling problems are not the fault of the consumer, and that there are systemic problems that can only be fixed by strong government policies that incentivize businesses who benefit from putting recyclables into our communities, to engage in waste reduction and create a circular economy for their products.",United States,2019.06
823,Single-Use Plastics Directive is Published in the Official Journal of the EU,"The Single-Use Plastics Directive — Directive (EU) 2019/904 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment—was published in the Official Journal of the European Union (click here to view). It will impact plastic food-contact materials and articles through, among others, a ban on certain single-use plastics, increased collection goals for plastic packaging, extended producer responsibility schemes, and design requirements for beverage containers.

By way of background, in January 2018, the European Commission (EC) published a Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy. The Strategy called for measures at EU and Member State (MS) level to reduce “the unnecessary generation of plastic waste, especially waste from single-use items.” Further, the Strategy also confirmed the legislative work on the initiative on single-use plastics at the EU level leading to the publication of the draft Directive in May 2018. The EC stated in its 2019 work program published on October 23 2018, that ‘[s]peedy agreement on the proposal on single-use plastics is necessary.” Thereafter, consensus between the European Parliament and the Council on the wording of the draft text was reached relatively quickly.

According to the preamble, the Single-Use Plastics Directive “promotes circular approaches that give priority to sustainable and non-toxic re-usable products and re-use systems rather than to single-use products, aiming first and foremost to reduce the quantity of waste generated.” (See the PackagingLaw.com articles, EU Publishes Updated Draft of Single-Use Plastics Directive and Plastic Packaging in a Circular Economy, for more background information on the Single-Use Plastics Directive and the circular economy more generally.)

MSs will have until July 3, 2021, to enact laws, regulations, and administrative provisions necessary to comply with most of the provisions of the Directive, although longer deadlines apply to certain provisions. For example, MSs have until July 3, 2024 to apply measures to ensure that certain single-use beverage containers that have caps and lids made on plastic may be only placed on the market if the caps and lids remain attached to the containers during the products’ intended use storage.

The Directive also includes deadlines for the EC. These include, for instance, a July 3, 2020 deadline to publish guidelines, in consultation with Member States, which would include examples of what is to be considered a single-use plastic product for the purposes of the Directive. Importantly, the EC prepared a statement to express concerns about the feasibility of complying with several deadlines, including this one.",United States,2019.06
824,Circular economy: Marine plastic being woven into shoes and tees | Mumbai News - Times of India,"Ocean plastic running shoes knitted using yarn spun out of pet bottles collected at the Versova beach

Don't be alarmed if you're told that the running shoes or t-shirt in your closet was once a plastic bottle of soda that you drank and tossed into the ocean. This isn't a make-believe tale of the ocean's revenge nor a gimmick but a way of turning the scourge of plastic pollution into circular economy where discarded plastic can be reused, recycled and composted.The impact of plastic on the ocean is heart breaking. A 2017 report by the United Nations revealed that about 8 million tons of plastic enters the sea every year and at that rate plastics would outweigh fish in the ocean by 2050. Plastic threats to marine life drew greater attention the same year when British naturalist Sir David Attenborough described distressing moments of an albatross feeding its chick plastic instead of fish.The good news? An increasing number of mainstream companies are now trying to rectify past damage and drafting changes in their business models to protect the ocean and eliminate virgin plastic. Big brands with the help of designers are giving used plastics a second life by sorting, grinding and spinning the hardened synthetic - intercepted at beaches and coastal communities into fibre and yarn - for its reincarnation as shoes, clothes, bags and chairs.Mumbai's filth-laden beaches have become the epicentre of this movement with brands like Adidas and Pepsi joining forces with Afroz Shah - advocate-turned-beach crusader steering the world's largest beach cleanups every weekend - to dredge out plastic waste washed ashore and sending truckloads of baled bottles into recycling plants.Since 2015, when sportswear brand Adidas partnered with Parley For The Oceans (a global marine conservation network), 14 million tonnes of plastic bottle trash collected from Versova's beach every weekend have traveled all the way to a polyester manufacturing plant in Nashik to be upcycled into yarn for sportswear. They have also sought the help of Versova's fishing village and activated two fishermen boats to trawl for trash in the mangroves that tend to trap marine litter and retain floating plastics more than bare beaches.More recently, in a massive beach clean-up drive across nine beaches and four rivers in Mumbai, PepsiCo India in partnership with GEM Enviro, a plastic recycling company that collects over 3000 PET bottles and over 1,000 other kinds of plastic in a month, deployed special collection trucks starting with Mahim beach and Mithi river to ship the ocean plastic to be segregated, cleaned and converted into t-shirts, waste bins, chairs and even traffic cones.TOI travelled to Dindori in Nashik, the grape farming belt of Maharashtra for a closer look at the polyester recycling plant using a patented chemical reprocessing technology to convert 2 million plastic pet bottles into wearable material every day.Moisture can be a bad thing for recycling process so the baled bottles collected from beaches are first taken to a facility in Vapi where they are shredded into flakes to get rid of those drops before being shipped to Dindori. It is here that the flakes are bathed in water and chemicals to remove ""impurities"" - caps, adhesive, labels, ink, colour and metals; melted into pellets and extruded into threads.This reclaimed marine plastic yarn is then transported to Adidas's manufacturing bases around the world where they are crafted into those familiar trainers that reuse an average of 11 plastic bottles per pair while the green wave pattern across the uppers is made from illegal deep-sea fishing gill nets.""At present we recycle 2 million bottles of one litre weightage a day. In two years we plan to start recycling 8 to 10 million bottles a day, which converts to a 100 metric tonnes of yarn daily,"" explained Makarand Kulkarni, CEO, Polygenta that has also tied up with hotels, malls, and NGOs to scale up the upcycling process.Given the landfill space that plastic bottles usually occupy and 700 years that it takes to decompose, replacing virgin plastic with recycled marine plastic debris is also improving environmental footprint with ""86 percent less use of water and carbon-di-oxide generation halved,"" he adds.Afroz Shah who managed to clear 25 million kilos of garbage from the beaches at Versova, Danapani and Mithi River in the past two years, is also educating local businesses and residents around the ""human-ocean conflict zones"" to embrace circular economy. ""It's important for multinationals to look beyond plastic bottles and collaborate with local communities to upcycle other categories of plastic waste too,"" stresses Shah who is working with local youth in Sagar Kutir Wadi, Siddharthnagar, Filter Pada and Chuna Pada on how to reuse discarded milk pouches and polythene bags that neither ragpickers nor big brands pick up.",United States,2019.06

837,Famous Wensleydale Cheese Creamery to Turn Whey Waste into Biogas for Heating Homes,"This English cheese company won’t just be producing delicious dairy products with their famous Wensleydale cheeses – they will also be using their factory waste as a new source of cleaner renewable energy.

The Wensleydale Creamery will soon be using all of their whey waste to make biogas that is expected to heat about 800 English homes every year.

The creamery recently partnered with environmentalist fund manager Iona Capital to produce the biogas in their Yorkshire facility. Collectively, the venture will in turn produce 10,000 MWh of thermal power using a process called anaerobic digestion.

LOOK: School District Turns Unused Cafeteria Food into Take-Home Meals for Kids in Need

The fund manager has already established nine anaerobic digestion facilities across Yorkshire, investing $127 million (£100 million) in the region, as well as opening its York office in June 2018. The renewable energy plants save the equivalent of 37,300 tons of CO2 each year.

Mike Dunn, co-founder of Iona, said: “This partnership with Wensleydale not only shows how we are turning waste food products into useful energy for homes and business, but also our commitment to Yorkshire.”

Furthermore, after the sustainable green gas has been created, they will take what’s left at the end of the process and fertilize neighboring farmland to improve local topsoil quality.

“This shows the real impact of the circular economy and the part intelligent investment can play in reducing our CO2 emissions.”

Wensleydale Creamery’s managing director David Hartley said: “The whole process of converting local milk to premium cheese and then deriving environmental and economic benefit from the natural by-products is an essential part of our business plan as a proud rural business.”

842,ASEAN leaders move to combat marine debris; Bangkok Declaration adopted at the start of talks,"BANGKOK – The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has made a landmark commitment to strengthen efforts to prevent and reduce marine debris during a regional summit here.

At the start of the summit talks, 10 Southeast Asian leaders have adopted the Bangkok Declaration on combating Marine Debris reaffirming the regional bloc’s commitment to conserving the marine environment.

Under the Bangkok declaration, the regional bloc has vowed: “to strengthen actions at the national level as well as through collaborative actions among the ASEAN Member States and partners to prevent and significantly reduce marine debris, particularly from land-based activities, including environmentally sound management.”

The group has expressed concern that rapid marine debris pollution, particularly plastic litter, may negatively impact marine ecosystems, fisheries, economics, public health, and society, among others, without immediate action.

The leaders also agreed to encourage “an integrated land-to-sea approach to prevent and reduce marine debris, and strengthen national laws and regulations as well as enhance regional and international cooperation including on relevant policy dialogue and information sharing.”

The group also committed to enhancing multi-stakeholder coordination and cooperation to combat marine debris, including implementing joint actions and partnerships for addressing such a challenge.

They will also promote innovative solutions to enhance plastics value chains and improve resource efficiency by prioritizing approaches such as the circular economy and 3R (reduce, reuse, recycle).

Research capacity and application of scientific knowledge would also be strengthened to combat marine debris, in particular, to support science-based policy and decision making.

The group also committed to accelerating advocacy and actions to increase public awareness and participation, and enhance education on reducing marine debris.

The declaration was accompanied by the Framework of Action that comprises Policy Support and Planning; Research, Innovation, and Capacity Building; Public Awareness, Education, and Outreach; and Private Sector Engagement. Each priority area consists of actions and suggested activities for further collaboration in the ASEAN region and among ASEAN and its partners in combating marine debris.

The declaration, however, did not include any planned ban on single-use plastic or foreign waste imports as environmental groups earlier appealed for prior to the regional summit.

The world’s top polluters reportedly included ASEAN members Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Thailand.",United States,2019.06
843,Commentary: We discard things rather than fix them. Here's why that should change,"Not only can a 'repair economy' save natural resources and reduce waste, but it may also help create a kinder, more inclusive society, says author Katherine Wilson.

MELBOURNE: John switches on the power saw he bought secondhand on eBay. The machine “arcs” – shooting out a visible electric charge. So he takes it apart to investigate.

He identifies the problem: The field coil, a current-carrying component that generates an electric field. Once fixed, the saw works as new.

I met John during my doctoral research into tinkerers — people who love to adapt and repair things. But many things have become harder to fix.



Just a few decades ago, manufacturers packaged everyday appliances with instructions on how to repair them. Now they come with danger warnings and threats that doing so will void the warranty.

Repair is discouraged by unavailable replacement parts, glued assemblies and tamper-proof cases that are difficult to open. So we discard things rather than fix them.

Much research suggests this harms more than the natural environment.

It also affects our mental environment. There’s a connection between the way society treats material objects and the way it treats people.

Returning to an economy of repair could help create a kinder, more inclusive society. By mending broken things we might also help mend what’s broken in ourselves.

REPAIR IS AN INVESTMENT OF OURSELVES

The environmental case for a repair economy is obvious. It saves natural resources and reduces waste.

There’s also a strong economic case. In his book Curing Affluenza, Australian economist Richard Denniss argues a community that repairs its goods “would employ more people, per dollar spent, than a community that instinctively disposes of them”. It would create more high-skill jobs and reduce the cost of living.

The social case is as strong. As Europe starts banning the disposal of unsold and returned consumer products, a mounting body of research shows that repair economies can make people happier and more humane.

During research for my 2017 book Tinkering: Australians Reinvent DIY Culture, I learned how material repair generates a deep sense of care, pride, belonging and civic participation.

Even solitary acts of repair involve a community of influences. Through acts of repair we experience products as expressions of our collective knowledge. Repaired products become bearers and extensions of personhood: Like genomes, they carry their pasts within their presence.

By contrast, product obsolescence “blocks our access to the past”, argues Francisco Martínez, an ethnographer at the University of Helsinki.

His research found repair was “helping people overcome the negative logic that accompanies the abandonment of things and people”.

Repair made “late modern societies more balanced, kind and stronger”. It was a form of care, of “healing wounds”, binding generations of humanity together.

Like Polish sociologist Zygmunt Bauman, Martinez draws parallels between the displacement and neglect of objects and those of people.

In Estonia, Martinez says, repairing things “establishes continuity, endurance and material sensitivity” in a society disrupted by Soviet-style socialism and subsequent transition to capitalism:

Similar observations have been made in different economies.

Studying Londoners living in reviled council flats following the Thatcher years, British anthropologist Daniel Miller observed residents who fixed their kitchens. Those with strong and fulfilling social relationships were more likely to do so; those with few and shallow relationships less likely.

Miller is among many scholars who have observed that relationships between people and material things tend to be reciprocal. When we restore material things, they serve to restore us.

Repair economies don’t regard material things as expendable. They relocate value in the workings, relations and meanings of things. By contrast, consumer economies encourage us to relate with products in ways that damage the planet and promote a kind of learned helplessness.

In response, the global “right to repair” movement has mobilised.



Initiatives include community tool libraries and repair cafes, where people take their broken things, share tools and get expert guidance on how to fix them. There are swap-meets, Remakeries, Mens’ Sheds, visible mending workshops, Hackerspaces, Restart Parties and Commons Transitions enterprises.

Such “glocal” — at once global and local — initiatives re-inscribe humane values into mass culture. They encourage participatory citizenship and create informal exchanges of knowledge, skills, materials, goodwill and values.

They create what sociologists call cultural capital, the benefits of which are recognised in public health funding of initiatives such as Men’s Sheds.

In Europe, environment ministers are pushing laws obliging manufacturers to make appliances repairable and enduring.

Many US states are considering “fair repair” laws, and authorities have deemed it unlawful for phone and other tech manufacturers to prevent owners repairing their products. Australia is considering ways to promote a “circular economy”, in which material resources circulate for as long as possible.

We already have the tools to move away from an economy that values overconsumption and wasting resources. Doing so would allow us to fix more than just our products.

844,A voice for sustainability,"From 9-10 a.m. on Sundays, Moncrief introduces listeners to people who make a difference in the sustainability community. Corporate leaders, mayors and sustainability managers for U.S. cities, including Atlanta, have been interviewed on what they are doing to address climate change.

“This is about education and enlightening people,” said Moncrief. “And hopefully getting them to change and modify the environment.”

The Old Fourth Ward resident’s first environmental talk show was on Blog Talk Radio about nine years ago. The first episode - a history lesson on the pristine landscape of the U.S. when the first settlers arrived - resonated with listeners.

The Ray C. Anderson Foundation is a primary sponsor of his current show, which premeired in 2014.

“He preached to other CEOs around the world that you can do business and not plunder the earth,” said Moncrief of Anderson, who passed away in 2011.

An example of that goal is an initiative that partners Novelis, a leader in aluminum recycling, with the Atlanta Falcons, Moncrief’s Green Guy Media, the National Black and Latino Council, Habitat for Humanity, Keep America Beautiful and the Atlanta’s Office of Sustainability. Together they formed the “Recycle for Good” campaign.

“During home games of the Falcons and Atlanta United, a team of volunteers collects cans inside and outside the stadium and educate fans on recycling,” said Lance Robertson, executive director of the National Black and Latino Council. “This is pretty ongoing and Eric has been there from the beginning.”

A collection of three million cans will be enough material to build a home in Vine City through Atlanta Habitat for Humanity.

“Kids are the next generation of environmental stewards,” adds Moncrief. “All the environmental, recycling, clean energy, water, climate change, the circular economy – it’s all connected.”

845,LyondellBasell and Neste produce bio-based plastic for food packaging,"LyondellBasell and Neste have produced bio-based polypropylene and low-density polyethylene at commercial scale.

The partnership produced several thousand tonnes of the bio-based products at LyondellBasell’s Wesseling facility using Neste’s renewable hydrocarbons, which are derived from sustainable raw materials such as waste and residue oils.

The materials are marketed under Circulen and Circulen Plus, respectively, and have received approval for use in food packaging.

LyondellBasell olefins and polyolefins Europe, Asia and international senior vice-president Richard Roudeix said: “LyondellBasell has an innovative spirit that spans decades, and achievement like this showcases concrete actions we are taking in support of a circular economy.

“Through the use of renewable resources, we are contributing to the fight against climate change and helping our customers achieve their environmental targets.”



The materials were tested by an independent third party using carbon tracers. The audit confirmed that the products contained more than 30% renewable content.

LyondellBasell piloted the products in collaboration with multiple customers, including Cofresco. This foodservice company will use the Circulen Plus bio-based polyethylene to create sustainable food packaging materials.

Neste president and CEO Peter Vanacker said: “It is very satisfying to see Neste’s renewable hydrocarbons performing perfectly in commercial-scale production of bio-based polymers, providing a drop-in replacement option to fossil materials.

“This pioneering collaboration with LyondellBasell marks a major milestone in the commercialisation of Neste’s renewable polymers and chemicals business focusing on developing renewable and circular solutions for forward-looking sustainable brands.”

In August last year, LyondellBasell acquired plastics material and resin manufacturing company A. Schulman for $2.25bn.",United States,2019.06
846,Blanket ban on plastic waste will affect legal recyclers – Industry players,"A blanket ban on plastic waste as called by a consumer association will hurt law-abiding plastics recyclers, as well as drive them out of business, says industry players.

The Malaysian Plastics Manufacturers Association (MPMA) and the Malaysia Plastics Recyclers Association (MPRA) also said such a move would not help the government in combating smugglers and illegal plastic recyclers.

“As an economic activity, recycling is crucial to creating new value that benefits society and contributes to sustainability. Legal operators support Malaysia’s manufacturing and export sectors in industries such as electrical and electronics, automotive and others. A total ban would bring Malaysia’s participation in the global circular economy to a halt,” they said in a joint statement today.

They pointed out that the Malaysian government had not allowed imports of ‘sampah plastik’ since 2008 and all law-abiding plastic recyclers had been complying with the ban.

“This means ‘sampah plastik’ from overseas was smuggled into Malaysia and illegally imported.

“We hope the continuing debate will focus on the more immediate problem of how to properly dispose of existing ‘sampah plastik’ and prevent future smuggling. This would be more productive than harming legitimate businesses which have not broken the law,” they said.

The associations also reiterated their stand that Malaysia had no place for other countries’ rubbish.

“We continue to support and are ready to assist the government in their efforts to crack down on these unscrupulous and illegal operators and to protect the environment,” they added.",United States,2019.06
847,Unpacking Sustainability: different approaches to the Circular Economy at FachPack,"At FachPack this September and in conjunction with the Sustainability Awards 2019, Packaging Europe will be presenting the Sustainable Packaging Summit, exploring contrasting approaches to a Circular Economy in packaging and how to choose the appropriate path.

Nuremberg, Germany will host this year's essential sustainable packaging discussion as Packaging Europe hosts the Sustainable Packaging Summit, followed by the Sustainability Awards 2019, on 25 September from 16:00 at the PackBox Forum.

Star speakers at this year's Summit include TerraCycle’s Tom Szaky, the mastermind behind the widely publicised Loop reusable packaging concept, and Dana Mosora –one of the organisers of the CEFLEX project to build universal recycling of flexible packaging across Europe. We will also hear from two global brand owners (P&G’s Gian De Belder and PepsiCo’s Chris Daly) who are taking part in both Loop and CEFLEX, in addition to many other circular initiatives. The four speakers will come together for an illuminating panel discussion following their presentations moderated by Packaging Europe's head of content Tim Sykes.

First up will be Gian De Belder, principal scientist, packaging R&D at Procter & Gamble. Gian’s presentation 'P&G's Ambition 2030: latest innovations and value chain collaboration' will outline P&G’s renewed sustainability strategies (packaging focus), highlighting the importance of cross value chain collaborations and the need to work on all five critical pillars to realise a Circular Economy for packaging.

Following him is TerraCycle CEO and founder Tom Szaky, who will speak about 'Eliminating the idea of waste'. Tom will discuss the theory of waste and how through business we eliminate the idea of it. Also, how one can find other areas of value, whether in packaging or products, beyond just the material value and hopefully to be inspired that our future can be a world where the concept of waste doesn’t exist and yet our products can be more exciting, more convenient and better than ever.

Next Dana Mosora (consultant at CEFLEX) will present on the subject of 'Driving the circular economy for flexible packaging through full value chain collaboration'. Recycling is key to realising the Circular Economy for plastic packaging, Dana will argue. But this needs to be done with a favourable environmental footprint and delivering valuable secondary materials. The CEFLEX collaboration of over 100 companies and associations in Europe is steadily working out how and when to recycle flexible packaging to ensure the resulting Circular Economy is a sustainable one for all parts of the value chain.

The presentation will share insight into how what is non-recyclable today can be recycled tomorrow through packaging and system redesign; optimisation and enhancement in sorting and decontamination of post-consumer flexible packaging waste; and new enabling technologies to recycle more and/or produce better quality of secondary materials.

Finally, Chris Daly (VP Sustainability at PepsiCo ESSA) will speak about 'A circular future today'. Chris will explore what a circular future looks like from the PepsiCo perspective and the challenges and opportunities around realising that future. What actions and partnerships do we need in order to reach the circular future faster?

Following the panel discussion guests will be invited to stay for drinks, networking, further discussion and the announcements of the winners of the Sustainability Awards 2019.",United States,2019.06
848,A Reuse-Heavy Circular Economy Could Help Lower Plastic Pollution,"Right now, we throw away a lot of products when we're done with them. A recycling- and reuse-focused circular economy could reduce a lot of waste.

Plastic pollution, on land and in the oceans, is one of the most urgent environmental issues the world faces.

""We are overusing what the planet can provide for us on a normal cycle. We have 7 billion people today, we're gonna have 9 billion people and we're already using one and a half planets. Right. So the planet produces things and then it needs some time to renew. It needs some time to have that the regrowth. So that I can make something again and we are just we're using things quicker than it can renew,"" Erin Simon, Director of Sustainability R&D for World Wildlife Fund told Newsy.

Now, manufacturers — from very recognizable brands to small businesses — are looking for a more sustainable alternatives to the way that we use goods. Right now, the way the majority of us consume products, everything from clothing to appliances, is in a linear system-that’s completed with the end of life of the product. We buy something, use it, and throw it away.

""In the past 15 years, half of the plastic ever produced was made. And that's because we have proliferated our use of plastics. Not just in single use plastics which I think are always top of mind, but also in housewares, in construction, in clothing, and automotive, and obviously food service, in health care. And so as we have proliferated that use we haven't really done the best job at figuring out what to do with all of that when we're done with it,"" Simon said.

The alternative: a circular economy. It relies on a continuous looped system and the end of use, not the end of life. When a consumer no longer needs a product, the item goes back to a manufacturer, gets recycled, or broken down into pieces that can.

Alicia Forero is with TerraCycle, a company that specializes in hard-to-recycle things like cigarette butts and dirty diapers. She says one of the biggest drivers of recycling today is the desire to turn a profit.

""We literally sent someone to the moon, you know as a society, we can we can figure out how to take one material and turn it into something else. Your normal recycling company, they are essentially urban miners in that they're looking for material that they can profit off of collecting and aggregating and selling downstream,"" she said.

But some manufacturers are now paying even more attention to the environmental benefits of reusing stuff. In 2015, the fashion industry produced more than 5 percent of global CO2 emissions. Now, the Global Fashion Agenda says 12.5% of the global market have set goals to recycle more materials. Like the small business Pingree, a shoemaker that reuses leather scraps from Detroit automakers. Or Unifi, a company out of North Carolina that recycles single-use plastic bottles into synthetic polyester (called repreve) for everything from clothing to car filters.

""We've now reached a critical point where the entire industries that are using polyester are shifting over to recycled. Because people are seeing what's happening to our oceans with plastic. So when we create this chip we put a proprietary tracer in there and then we have an outside lab.they can see what is made in the finished garment and they could put it under a microscope and they can tell that it is made with repreve,"" Richard Gerstein, Executive Vice President for Unifi/Repreve said.

Household products are going circular, too. This June at Sustainable Brands in Detroit, Proctor and Gamble told Newsy the company updated its environmental goals to be more aggressive, including 50 percent less plastic in packaging by 2030.

""A month ago we launched our brand 2030 criteria. And those are criteria against which we are holding all those leadership brands accountable to enable and inspire responsible consumption. And we are making that public and we're looking both you know very regularly on our progress,"" Virginie Helias, Chief Sustainability Officer for Proctor and Gamble told Newsy.

Proctor & Gamble, Unilever, and Nestle are some brands that have partnered with Loop, a sort of milk-man model where long-lasting refillable packaging goes to the user’s home, and then back to the manufacturer when its empty. Right now, it serves four states and Washington DC, and is set to be available in Toronto in 2020.

This could help address the biggest remaining hurdle: consumer behavior. One study found almost three of every four millennials said they'd be willing to spend more on sustainable products, but so far the whole world only recycles about 9 percent of plastics. Experts say designing products that will hold up to the wear and tear of a more circular economy will get consumers' attention — and so will holding companies accountable.

852,Can the Circular Economy End the Era of “Throwaway Living”? – Press Releases on CSRwire.com,"Jun. 21 /CSRwire/ - In 1955, LIFE magazine ran an ad promoting “Throwaway Living,” encouraging the use of disposable items as a way to help cut down on household chores.

We used to depend on plastic, and now, our planet is being suffocated by it. Environmental impacts are showing the need for a more circular economy, and businesses are responding by offering innovation solutions, such as new products, packaging and business models, to address resource scarcity and climate risk – not to mention unlock a $4.5 trillion economic opportunity.

854,The circular designer’s secret weapon: policy | Greenbiz,"Since its inception in 2010, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation has placed design as crucial to achieving a circular economy. In fact, the very first initiative from the foundation was Project ReDesign, which invited thousands of students to rethink products and systems for a circular economy. Discussions around the circular economy in intervening years often serve to remind us of the importance of design, namely that the circular economy is a model for an economy that is regenerative by design. Why is this? If you look at many shortcomings of today’s take, make, dispose, linear economy, the eventual negative impacts have been set in motion at the design stage. The decisions made during this process influence what will happen downstream — how a product is made, used and disposed of, whether it will end up in an incinerator, landfill, ocean or unused in someone’s garage. These choices also could set an item on the path to being shared, repaired, recovered, remanufactured or composted. Ultimately, is the creation fit for a circular economy? Does it reinforce the status quo of extraction and consumption, or aspire to circulation and regeneration — putting back more than we take out? This is only made possible upstream, at the design phase. As materials expert Alysia Garmulewicz once quipped, ""You can’t unscramble an omelet."" Such design choices could include the type and variety of materials a product is made of, whether it’s assembled using glues or screws, and if it can be upgraded or improved in the future. Extending beyond the product itself, decisions relating to the business model play a crucial role. For example, is a detergent sold in tiny sachets, disposable bottles or a refillable system? For some products, sales and ownership are no longer the only option, and new methods such as rental, sharing and incentivized return are all possible.

The impacts set in motion at this design stage can be profound. Dealing with the symptoms of a linear economy ""end of pipe"" and cleaning up downstream is often more costly, less effective and at times not possible at all. We can see this clearly today with the near-irreversible symptoms of the way we make and use plastic. Once it has arrived in landfills and oceans, it is difficult to clean it up. On the other hand, building in circularity from the start can unlock safer or improved products and services, better relationships with customers, and resource and energy savings that benefit the bottom line. It’s through design that we can address the cause of today’s economic, social and environmental challenges, rather than just treating the symptoms. It should be clear by now that this has relevance far beyond the realm of the classical industrial designer. IDEO CEO Tim Brown has long maintained that ""design is everywhere; inevitably everyone is a designer."" So this phase is crucial not just to one department but to the entire organization when setting sights on a circular economy. Without a focus on design, the circular economy will not happen. However, there’s a stalemate. Without a focus on design, the circular economy will not happen. However, there’s a stalemate. Designers — and all those involved in the creation of new products and services — face competing demands. Even if they design with the circular economy in mind, their efforts can be overwhelmed by the linear systems in place today. Elsewhere in the system, businesses that recover products for repair or recycling, for example, need to have the processes or technology in place to handle what designers are sending their way. This disconnect hinders sincere efforts to move towards a circular economy. This is where policymakers play a vital role. Policymakers are uniquely positioned to put in place enabling conditions that allow the whole value chain to transition towards a circular economy. With a systems view, they have the power to connect the upstream and downstream, and set optimal conditions for the overall system to work. Focusing policy measures on the design stage can reconcile economic, environmental and societal demands, creating and distributing the rewards of a better approach. As well as designers coming up with new circular concepts, there needs to be corresponding ""pull"" factors to align efforts. Designers need confidence that their latest creations will be handled the right way further down the chain, whether that’s how items are collected or if they can be recirculated without regulatory hurdles. Designers need confidence that their latest creations will be handled the right way further down the chain. This may involve removing non-financial barriers to designing for the circular economy, such as definitions of waste that hinder trade and transport of products for remanufacturing, or imperfect information that prevents businesses engaging in repair, disassembly and refurbishment activities. Users also will need to be nudged in the right direction. During this shift in our economy, even products and services designed for a circular economy could fall into more well-trodden linear pathways, such as improper disposal or underuse. In 2017 the Swedish government demonstrated an elegant example of how policymakers can set this direction. The amendment saw value-added tax, or VAT, reduced from 25 percent to 12 percent for repairing items such as bicycles, clothes, household linen, leather goods and shoes. Actions such as this could have positive ripple effects throughout the economy. For a start, reduced VAT should make repairing items more affordable and appealing for customers. On top of that, designers are provided with an added incentive to design for this new arrangement, making their products more repairable.

While policies such as this can trigger new behaviors from designers, manufacturers and businesses alike, a common vision and approach would have a unifying effect across the design industry. To date, the European Commission’s Ecodesign directive has been effective in terms of decreasing energy consumption. Now is the time to broaden the scope of the directive to consider better material choices, innovative business models and activities such as repairability and recyclability. Signals throughout the economy tell us that the time is right to unite behind this shared ambition. Designers are becoming more familiar with the circular economy, and thousands have used the Circular Design Guide and are building a movement by connecting online. Ranging from designers in corporates to students and professors to freelancers or those in agencies, they want to use their creativity to redesign products and services for the circular economy. With this new way of seeing the world comes the passion and agency to redesign it. Developments in technology are unlocking new possibilities for circular products and business models, including tracking the status and performance of assets using internet of things, the communication of material composition through digital watermarks, optimizing material use with 3D printing and sharing product information via blockchain. Business leaders from all industries are committing to ambitious circular economy targets. Throughout society, more citizens are aware of the shortcomings of the linear economy, whether it’s the impacts of pollution, badly designed products or demands for better service and transparency from business. During Project ReDesign, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s first educational project, the response from students and teachers throughout the country revealed how the circular economy can make people optimistic about the future. With this new way of seeing the world comes the passion and agency to redesign it. We all know that individual passion and drive can achieve great progress. If we match this energy with incentives, knowledge building and a clear license to explore these possibilities, we truly will usher in a new era of design.",United States,2019.06
858,to Host Inaugural Leadership Summit: 50 Cities Driving the Circular Economy,"FALLS CHURCH, VA — On June 24-26, 2019, The Recycling Partnership will host their inaugural Leadership Summit: 50 Cities Driving the Circular Economy, inviting a select 50 cities and their sustainability representatives for a two-day summit in Chicago to drive recycling systems change across the country.

The all-expenses-paid, invitation-only meeting will feature results-driven ‘how-to’ workshops on implementing infrastructure, fighting contamination, and using effective, aligned recycling messaging to better engage residents to capture quality materials at the recycling cart. Participants will leave equipped with a comprehensive set of ready-to-use tools and resources to drive recycling systems change in their communities.

The Recycling Partnership selected invitees using population and recycling program data in an effort to bring together 50 of the largest communities focusing on curbside recycling programs and infrastructure, geographically distributed across the United States. Based upon census data from the American Community Survey, the 50 cities attending the Leadership Summit represent 45 million Americans, or 14 percent of the U.S. population.

“There’s currently a false narrative being spread regarding the strength – or supposed lack thereof – of the recycling industry,” said Keefe Harrison, CEO of The Recycling Partnership. “Our Leadership Summit is one of many ways we’re highlighting the investments that communities are making in recycling because Americans value recycling and know that it is essential for the health and future of our planet. The Partnership, along with our funding partners, is committed to bolstering a sustainable, long-lasting system that will weather the storm of market changes.”

Communities, manufacturers, material recycling facilities and corporations are investing in recycling in the United States because a connected recycling system drives a robust circular economy. Without recycling, we would continue to rely on a linear economy that further depletes the Earth’s natural resources. Recycling diverts hundreds of millions of pounds of recyclables from landfills and avoids millions of metric tons of greenhouse gas annually – creating healthier air and cleaner water at home and around the globe.

The Summit will be funded in part by the PepsiCo Foundation, Target and the Walmart Foundation, whose contributions will also fund post-workshop grants for select communities to implement recycling infrastructure and education and outreach tactics to improve the quality of their recyclables as well as their programs.

“Most Americans want to recycle more, and would, with easily accessible containers and clear information about recycling practices,” said Kathleen Niesen, Director, Recycling and Sustainability, PepsiCo Beverages North America. “Boosting recycling access and infrastructure begins on the local level, so we applaud the Recycling Partnership for bringing city leaders together to address local challenges and find solutions to strengthen our recycling system. Increasing recycling is critical to the health of our planet, and we’re pleased to see communities joining together with private and non-profit partners to make needed progress.”

“We’re proud to partner with The Recycling Partnership,” said Lisa Boyd, senior director of corporate responsibility, Target. “We look forward to this inaugural Leadership Summit helping further recycling systems change across the country, building a better and brighter future for generations to come.”

“We must come together as a country and a world leader, as communities, regions, and states, as local businesses and global corporations, and as individuals, a human race, and a planet – if we want our children, our wildlife, and our world to have a healthy future,” Harrison said.

862,4 Big Benefits Of HPE Financial Services 'Circular Economy' Offerings,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Financial Services, which is doubling down on its channel business with new sales coverage and resources for partners, is driving a breakthrough concept called the “circular economy” into the tech world—the sustainable reuse of IT assets that provides dramatic financial and environmental benefits.

“Very few people were thinking about sustainability in an IT context until we introduced circular economy,” said HPE Financial Services President and CEO Irv Rothman.

Last year, 4 million assets were returned to HPE Financial Services—with 89 percent of them being refurbished and remarketed back into the circular economy for reuse.

Christopher Wellise, chief sustainability officer for HPE, said key to HPE’s circular economy success is the company’s long “legacy and track record” for refurbishing and remarketing IT assets. “You don’t want your assets to end up in the wrong place,” he said. “You want them to be dealt with, from a security standpoint, appropriately.”

In an interview with CRN, Rothman detailed four keys for partners looking to take advantage of the circular economy.

1. The Power Of The Circular Economy

HPE Financial Services has been in the circular economy business our entire existence for the last 20 years. We are all about renewing assets at the back end of a financing. We are all about reusing assets by remarketing them. We are all about extending the life of assets. We have this asset upcycling program, which is a circular economy program. We purchase assets from a customer that are either over-capacity or have reached the end of life. We provide the customer with transformation dollars. IT budgets are not getting any bigger. This gets the channel talking about sustainability, which everyone wants to talk about.

2. The Power Of Pay Per Use

Our ability to evaluate, take and manage asset risk is the underpinning to all these subscription, usage, utilization consumption models [like HPE GreenLake]. You can’t walk into a customer and say, ‘You are in the middle of digital transformation, let me sell you some equipment.’ The future is too uncertain, which is why customers want to move to consuming rather than owning IT. In order to make this price-competitive, you have to be able to take the risks associated with the assets. That is what we do better than anybody else does in the world.

Before, [partners] were only trying to sell the customer something. Now they are not only trying to sell the customer something, they are providing a means to enable that transformation. They are also providing a means for a company to have a social conscience through life-cycle asset management. When you go in there to have that conversation with a customer, that is a different conversation. You are getting trusted adviser status, and it’s a way to make money too.

4. Financial Impact On The Customer

The average data center has about $157 million worth of hardware. Last year, [HPE Financial Services] by ourselves put $330 million back into customers’ pockets through this asset upcycling services activity. That $330 million is cash that we provided to customers for use in their digital transformation by acquiring assets that were either excess capacity or fully depreciated. We had a customer in which we upcycled all of their [old and over-capacity] network equipment. They got 750 networking assets in the first asset upcycling project they did with us.

865,A Circular Economy for Plastics Comes One Step Closer to Reality,"Welcome to Thomas Insights — every day, we publish the latest news and analysis to keep our readers up to date on what’s happening in industry. Sign up here to get the day’s top stories delivered straight to your inbox.

Advanced plastics recycling and recovery have come to maturity at just the right moment for the U.S. as an increasing number of overseas trading partners refuse to import plastic waste.

This week, Malaysia announced it will return up to 3,000 tons of plastic waste to the U.S., the U.K., Japan, and 10 other countries. Malaysia’s refusal to import plastic waste follows plastic waste import permits being revoked in China, Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam, and India. The regulation is now being put on plastic-waste producing countries to clean up their own mess, which for the U.S. presents a daunting prospect. EPA data from 2015 estimates that 26 million tons of post-use plastics were sent to landfill in the U.S. that year, while 3.1 million tons were recycled.

A significant expansion in advanced plastic recycling and recovery technologies promises to turn this trend around. A report released by the American Chemistry Council predicts a dramatic acceleration towards a circular economy for plastics. With wide adoption, advanced plastics recycling and recovery could not only dramatically reduce waste but could result in 40,000 U.S. jobs (across recycling facilities and supply-chain partners), $2.2 billion in annual payroll, and just under $10 billion in economic output.

Advanced technologies include “chemical recycling” such as pyrolysis and depolymerization along with gasification which complements traditional recycling to help recover a much broader range of post-consumer plastics than previously thought possible. According to the report, plastics have a high energy content that can be converted to feedstocks for new plastics and chemicals, crude oil and lower carbon transportation fuels, and other petroleum products such as waxes and lubricants.

The ACC’s economic estimates above are based on an assumption of 260 new plastics recycling and recovery facilities across the U.S., each requiring a capital investment of $36 million and capable of processing 25,000 tons of mixed plastics each.

The organization has an ambitious goal to recycle or recover all plastic packaging used in the United States by 2040.",United States,2019.06
866,"Bad for environment, economy to ban all plastic recycling in Malaysia, say makers and recyclers | Malay Mail","GEORGE TOWN, June 20 — A blanket ban on all plastic recycling in the country does not benefit the country nor the local economy, the Malaysian Plastics Manufacturers Association (MPMA) and Malaysia Plastics Recyclers Association (MPRA) said today.

The two groups asserted that a total ban would penalise legit companies, their employees and their families, as well as the domestic industry which helps to reduce waste and create by-products for other sectors.

“Legal operators support Malaysia’s manufacturing and export sectors in industries such as electrical and electronics, automotive and others so a total ban would bring Malaysia’s participation in the global circular economy to a halt,” MPMA and MPRA said in a joint statement.

The groups are responding to a call by the Penang Consumers Association (CAP) for all approved permits issued to plastic waste recycling factories to be cancelled.

MPMA and MPRA pointed out that recycling played an important role in protecting the environment by managing the disposal of certain types of waste.

“As an economic activity, recycling is crucial to creating new value that benefits society and contributes to sustainability,” the groups said.

They stressed that they do not import municipal plastic waste from other countries and reiterated their stand that Malaysia has no place for other countries’ rubbish.

They said the main issue at hand is the illegal smuggling of municipal plastic waste from overseas by illegal operators.

“The focus should be on the smugglers and illegal operators, not on the law-abiding legal operators,” they said.

“We hope the continuing debate will focus on the more immediate problem of how to properly dispose of existing ‘sampah plastik’ and prevent future smuggling,” they added.

They said this would be more productive than harming legitimate businesses that have not broken the law.

They also voiced their support to the government in its efforts to crack down on the smugglers and illegal operators to protect the environment.

“We will continue to work with relevant government authorities to properly discuss a robust, effective regulatory framework for this industry and Malaysia’s role in the circular economy where the redeployment and reuse of resources is a key organising principle,” they said.

Yesterday, CAP’s acting president Mohideen Abdul Kader called on the Department of Solid Waste Management to cancel permits issued to companies that imported plastic waste.

He said the government has failed to address the issue of dumping of imported plastic waste and environmental pollution that was attributed to the plastic waste recycling industry.",United States,2019.06
868,Apple and Best Buy reveal their circular visions (and a new partnership) | Greenbiz,"Extending the time consumers spend using their electronics is maybe the lowest-hanging piece of fruit when it comes to advancing circularity. After all, the longer someone holds on to a laptop or smartphone, the longer its ""molecules are kept in play.""



Both electronics giants Apple and Best Buy have begun to make strides in that direction — despite imperfect product designs, supply chains and upgrade options — by making it easier for their customers to fix or take back busted or obsolete items.

""We really want those products to stay in use as long as possible, and this extends to our repair business,"" Alexis Ludwig-Vogen, Best Buy's director of corporate responsibility and sustainability, said at GreenBiz's inaugural circular economy event, Circularity 19, in Minneapolis.

As the two companies detailed progress toward circularity and sustainability on the Wednesday mainstage, they also announced a partnership enabling consumers to bring Apple products to Best Buy stores for Apple-certified repairs — expanding the options for consumers beyond Apple's 272 glossy storefronts and into Best Buy's 1,022 stores.

That's just one small example of companies teaming up to help further shared sustainability goals, not to mention their own bottom lines. But there's more to the picture. Here's a glimpse of how visions of circularity by Best Buy and Apple differ, and what else they're working on.

For Best Buy, circularity means that an electronic purchase that starts at the point of checkout can come full circle when the customer is done with the device. A gadget moves from the point of purchase through consumer usage and into repair, trade-in or recycling. The company itself is not in the business of producing goods, but it can move toward circularity by responsibly managing the flow of goods through its doors and online portal, as well as by nudging and supporting both suppliers and consumers in that direction.

Ludwig-Vogen noted that Best Buy's electronics takeback program has mushroomed from in-store parking lot events in 2009 into a complex logistics operation spanning all of its retail sites. Its 20,000 Geek Squad tech-support representatives, who repair 5 million items a year, also collect electronics from clients' homes. All in all, the retailer has collected 2 billion pounds of old PCs, cables, TVs and other electronics of recycling, possibly more than any other organization in the United States.

In its other sustainability news Wednesday, Best Buy committed to science-based targets to reduce its carbon emissions by 75 percent by 2030 through the expansion of its energy efficiency and LED lighting programs, investments in renewables and the addition of a hybrid vehicle fleet. The company seeks to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

The retailer also wants to reduce carbon emissions for customers by 20 percent by 2030 over 2017 levels, while saving them $5 billion in utility bills — largely by pushing its Energy Star-labeled items.

As equal parts designer, manufacturer and retailer, Apple's vision of circularity encompasses processes as diverse as dismantling iPhones via the Daisy robot, all the way back to ethically sourcing the raw materials for motherboards, touchscreens and packaging.

Apple's radical goal — announced in 2017 — to eliminate its use of mining in favor of recycled and renewable materials has made notable progress, as its 2019 Environmental Responsibility Report details. The company has been working on a menu of 13 materials from aluminum to cobalt to plastic to zinc. Often, the work involves designing pathways where none exist. For example, markets for recycled tin are robust, but not for rare earth elements. The company uses recycled tin solder in logic boards in 11 products.

""We have to go material by material and close those loops,"" Apple's senior director of operations and environmental initiatives, Sarah Chandler, said. ""We want to make but not take. ... Our ambition to end mining is as big as anything we've undertaken at Apple, and it's inspired some of our most innovative solutions.""

For instance, to use fully recycled aluminum — introduced last fall in the casing of its MacBook Air and Mac mini computers — Apple had to create its own alloy.

""I’ve heard more times than I care to count that making every one of the thousands of components in every Apple device out of recycled materials is impossible,"" Chandler said.

I’ve heard more times than I care to count that making every one of the thousands of components in every Apple device out of recycled materials is impossible. Yet Apple's history is dotted with seemingly magical innovations, and part of its reputational mystique arises from its tight-lipped relationship with the public. (Apple didn't broadcast that it was making a ""Jesus phone"" ahead of Steve Job's first iPhone unveiling in 2007.)

However, the company's sustainability goals have been a different story, especially after former EPA chief Lisa Jackson began to lead its environmental efforts in 2013. Apple consistently has set a stake in the ground with commitments, as if summoning others to follow while daring doubters to eat their words. Apple announced in 2016 that it would use 100-percent renewables, which it achieved in 2018. So far, 44 percent of its suppliers have committed to clean energy, and Apple says it's on track by next year to produce or procure 4 gigawatts of clean energy in its supply chain.

Needless to say, each time Apple meets a new target toward circularity, it sends an industry beacon that a transformation toward a circular economy isn't so impossible, after all.",United States,2019.06

871,Return to sender: An early Loop customer weighs in | Greenbiz,"Like sustainability advocates everywhere, I was excited in January to learn that TerraCycle was working with two dozen of the world’s largest brands to launch Loop, a ""circular economy"" e-commerce website.

Loop delivers products in reusable containers from brands that consumers already know and love. They magically appear on front doorsteps on an as-needed basis.

When a consumer empties the container of ice cream, shampoo, oatmeal, cleaning products, razor blades and other consumable products, they place the empty containers in a tote on their front porch and, like the milkman days of old, the containers are replaced with new products in reusable containers. The empty containers are returned, rinsed, refilled and redelivered.

A few weeks ago, the New York City area pilot market for Loop expanded to include my adopted hometown of Reading, Pennsylvania. I immediately signed up to try it out.

Here are my initial observations after receiving my second Loop shipment.

While there are opportunities for improvement (more below), the idea of Loop is an exciting rethinking of how brands deliver products to consumers.

Consumers no longer have to buy both the product and packaging that must be thrown away or recycled. They can spend their money on the product, not the packaging.

The deposits for the Loop containers and the delivery fee dramatically can increase the amount charged to your credit card and create a bit of sticker shock. Recycling bins no longer will be buried in piles of boxes, bottles and cans because Loop’s ""closed loop"" system allows the packaging to be reused multiple times.

If packaging is damaged or too worn for reuse, Loop takes responsibility for properly recycling it.

Each of my Loop shipments arrived in a tote with a tamper-resistant plastic lock-tie securing the zippers to ensure that the tote remains unopened during shipping.

After receiving my first shipment, I was prepared to be indignant that my first contact with Loop would be a plastic tab that I had to find some way to dispose of properly. Then I saw the text printed on the tag. It reads, in both English and French, ""Put me back in the Loop Tote for recycling.""

There was a similar sustainability surprise in my second Loop shipment when I opened the tote to find my new Gillette razor and razor blades. While the razor’s reusable case inexplicably was wrapped in single-use plastic, the razor set came with a small, resealable plastic pouch for collecting my used razor blades so they can be returned and recycled. They’ve made it easy to recycle my used razor blades. That’s impressive.

The packaging is rather attractive

Loop’s reusable packaging has been designed for consumer appeal in addition to being designed for durable reuse.

The star of the show is probably the reusable Haagen-Dazs ice cream container.

I’ve only seen quick glimpses of the container with actual ice cream in it because our teenage daughters devoured the contents of both containers shortly upon arrival in the Loop tote. Our daughters are, however, showing the empty container to houseguests as ""something cool my dad found.""

Our guest bathroom now includes a beautiful glass, refillable bottle with a plastic pump for dispensing Soapply’s ""This is more than soap"" hand soap.

Our master bath includes a refillable, glass bottle of Crest mouthwash with a silicone sleeve that is now the prettiest part of my side of the bathroom counter.

While I was happy to put the steel cut oats, spaghetti and wasabi peas in their refillable, retro-looking aluminum cans on the kitchen counter, I was overruled and they were moved to the pantry where we’re ""supposed to"" keep such products.

We did run into a challenge when we moved the spaghetti to the pantry — the attractive cylindrical spaghetti container takes up a lot more room than the single-use, rectangular cardboard boxes that we traditionally purchase. We go through a lot of spaghetti in our house and the reusable container takes up a lot of room on the spaghetti shelf.

The solution, which we only recently adopted, is to take the spaghetti out of Loop’s reusable container and store it in a reused, more space-efficient cardboard box from our traditional spaghetti brand.

Similarly, the attractive Clorox lemon-scented disinfectant wipes were moved beneath the sink because cleaning products are not, apparently, to be displayed like a work of fine art on the kitchen counter.

Both the Loop invoice and website make it very clear how much one pays for products versus how much one leaves as a refundable deposit for the reusable containers. They also separate out the shipping fee.

The deposits add up quickly, ranging from $15 for each Loop tote, $5 for each Haagen-Dazs container, $3 for a variety of other containers and $1.25 for the Soapply container.

The Loop website allows me to track my total deposits, and it’s possible to watch the deposit amount rise and fall as products are shipped and returned. At one point, I had $72.25 in reusable container deposit money sitting in my Loop account.

My first shipment included a $20 delivery fee, but I soon started receiving ""free shipping"" emails and did not pay shipping for my second delivery.

Compared to the prices for similar products at our local grocery store, the Loop prices are roughly equivalent for most products. The Crest mouthwash and Clorox wipes are the same price as my local store. The Gillette razors are about 6 percent more expensive with Loop and the Soapply product is about 5 percent more expensive than ordering from the Soapply website.

Unfortunately, however, the Haagen-Dazs ice cream is almost twice as expensive through Loop as it is at my local grocery store. With Loop (in my region), the 14 fluid-ounce vanilla ice cream (the only flavor available through Loop in my area) is $6.49 versus $3.33 for the same size at my local grocery store in a traditional cardboard packaging.

Note that my price comparisons exclude the deposit one leaves Loop to ensure returns of their reusable containers. Those deposits and the delivery fee dramatically can increase the amount charged to your credit card and create a bit of sticker shock.

Each Loop shipment comes with a reversible shipping label. You simply slide it out of a special pocket on top of the Loop tote, flip it over to reveal the return address and call UPS for pickup.

Based on my limited encounters with the Loop customer service team, they’re all very excited to be part of this bold new venture and to doing their part to change the world.

When our initial shipment of Crest mouthwash leaked a little during transit, the Loop customer service team quickly rectified it with an apology and a refund.

They also helped me correct a mistake when I unintentionally ordered my second shipment twice after encountering a problem with the website.

But the product selection is limited

In my region (and I can’t speak for the other pilot regions), there is not a wide product selection. The website lists 81 products, but 11 (including four of the five Haagen-Dazs flavors) have been out of stock since I joined.

Five more products, including the Cascade dishwashing soap and Tide laundry detergent, are listed as ""coming soon.""

That leaves 65 products, which is an impressive start for the pilot phase, but pales when compared with a typical grocery delivery service or the seemingly infinite Amazon options.

And some of the innovative products that I was most excited to see, such as the deodorants in reusable containers, are not yet listed on the website in my region.

Let’s face it. Amazon has spoiled us with overnight delivery and the expectation that we soon will be able to get things delivered within a few hours of placing an order.

As a result, the initial seven-day wait between placing my first order May 22 and receiving my first shipment May 29 felt like forever (especially with a spouse who sometimes rolls her eyes at my ""green ventures"").

The Loop team did warn me via email that my shipment might be delayed because my initial shipment was placed the Wednesday before the upcoming Memorial Day weekend.

I ordered my second shipment June 7 and received it June 11 (with a weekend in between that might have delayed shipping).

The Loop website includes a video of a couple receiving a Loop delivery, unloading their tote full of products in reusable containers, then efficiently folding the Loop tote compactly for easy storage.

My reality is that while the tote itself folds fairly compactly, the large, rigid, reusable Styrofoam-type container used to keep the ice cream cold takes up a lot of space. So does the massive amount of flexible, reusable fill used to keep the reusable containers safe during shipping.

We now keep the Loop tote and its packing materials in the garage until we’re ready to return empty containers. It works for us, but it might be challenging for those living in compact city apartments.

The Loop tote is heavy when empty

The Loop tote (19 inches x 16.5 inches x 16 inches) and all of its packaging materials for my second shipment, which included the reusable Styrofoam-like container and reusable icepacks to keep the ice cream cold, weighs 17.4 pounds without any products in it.

As a result, I felt guilty when I returned my first Loop tote, which I’m assuming weighed about the same, because my returned tote only contained an empty Haagen-Dazs ice cream container and all of the reusable packaging fill that was used to keep my original shipment well protected. We simply hadn’t emptied the other containers and, with a second Loop shipment on the way, it seemed silly to keep the original tote filling space in our garage. I can only imagine the carbon footprint of returning a nearly empty tote that weighs more than 17 pounds.

Being a part of the Loop pilot project allows me to feel like part of a radical transformation of the current consumer model. As more brands participate, as the system scales and as refillable containers begin lining traditional grocery store shelves and become available on additional online retailers, we’re going to see a significant reduction in single-use packaging.

It’s easy to imagine the day when the excessive packaging that currently clutters our lives will seem as quaint as the horse poop that used to collect in the streets during the days of the horse and buggy.

My family and I are excited to be part of the change, and we’re looking forward to seeing what comes next.",United States,2019.06
872,Circle Economy adapts methodology of global circularity metric for nation states - Circle Economy,"Austria is first nation to measure Circularity Gap

Amsterdam, June 19th 2019 - Circle Economy and Alstoff Recycling Austria (ARA) today announce the release of Circularity Gap Report Austria, the first measure of circularity for a nation state. This landmark report paves the way for nations to lead the transition from a linear economy of Take-Make-Waste to a circular economy. 



The analysis, commissioned by ARA, found a circularity rate for Austria of 9.7%, ahead of the figure of 9.1% in Circle Economy’s Global Circularity Gap report published in January 2019. The Austria report will enable political and business leaders to identify and monitor the best interventions to boost the circularity rate, the proportion of materials that are recycled, re-used and re-manufactured in the Austrian economy. 



The report estimates the improvements to be gained from four courses of action:
• Shifting from fossil fuels to renewable resources (boosting circularity to 9.9%)
• Maintaining current buildings and infrastructure by sourcing all construction materials from demolition of old building stocks (11.6%)

Combined, these four actions can boost Austria’s circularity rate to an estimated 37.4%.



Nation states can play a pivotal role in the global transition to a circular economy. Setting comprehensive national policies can drive global action, setting a benchmark for collaboration at multilateral level. The Paris Climate Agreement of 2015 is testimony to the influence of national governments in setting an agenda for the United Nations.



Austria ranks as one of the global frontrunners in recycling. After four decades of policy interventions, 58% of all municipal waste is recycled. The Circularity Gap Austria identifies opportunities to radically reduce inputs of primary materials, including waste and emissions. This study, commissioned by ARA, demonstrates Austria’s determination to unlock new business opportunities as a frontrunner in the circular economy.

Applying the methodology of the Global Circularity Gap Report to a national context, Circle Economy has focused on two parallel methodologies: a production-based analysis and a consumption-based analysis. 



The production-based methodology tracks materials that are produced within a closed system. This analysis is comprehensive at a global scale, when the planet is in effect a closed system. When applied to a nation state, however, the production-based analysis will not include the full material footprint of imported goods. 



The consumption-based methodology adapted from Circle Economy’s Global Circularity Gap Report tracks products across the entire supply chain. This analysis tracks material footprints across the globe, to measure the total material cost behind domestic consumption.



The Circularity Gap Report Austria is the first of its kind. Its outcomes therefore have relevance beyond providing an agenda for Austria. As a contribution to the discourse on the measurement of circularity at national level, the report sets a precedent for other nations to steer effective collaboration in the realisation of a circular economy.



""Austria is taking a pioneering role in the transition to the circular economy. This Circularity Gap Report - Austria shows how Austria is performing as a country in comparison to the global average of 9,1%. In this epoch of climate breakdown, with profound societal and economic challenges, our vision of a circular economy is an inclusive, sustainable and future-proof model for development. We have done this work with hundreds of businesses and dozens of cities around the world. With this report commissioned by ARA, Austria becomes the first country to bring national perspective to this global debate. Austria has developed a strong social partnership over the years, with a strong record in recycling. We hope that all stakeholders - policymakers, industry, academia and civil society - will build on the great ideas put forward in this report, and jointly map a path to faster and scalable action."" -- Harald Friedl, CEO, Circle Economy

""Turning from the global to national level with Austria, we used a hybrid methodology bringing a greater focus on consumption to our assessment. Looking simply at production, we can track only what is produced in a system or enters as a finished product. Fine for the globe, but when focusing on a nation, such a model cannot account for materials used in production outside the state, the full material footprint of a product. By tracking products across the entire supply chain, even when their footprints criss cross the globe, we can measure the total material cost behind domestic consumption."" -- Marc de Wit, lead strategic partnerships and consulting, Circle Economy

For further information and to arrange interviews with the report’s authors, please contact Mark Ashurst at press@circle-economy.

Circle Economy works with cities and businesses to accelerate the transition to a circular economy and to close the Circularity Gap. An impact organisation, we identify opportunities to turn circular economy principles into practical reality.



Our work combines practical insights with scalable responses to achieve our vision of economic prosperity and societal balance within planetary boundaries. Our mission is to connect and empower a global community in business, cities and governments to create the conditions for systemic transformation.",United States,2019.06
876,"Why Google, and the business world, are embracing the circular economy | Greenbiz","Despite being a digital behemoth, managing the world's bits and bytes for all manner of information services, Google actually generates a lot of ""stuff,"" such as servers in its data centers, campus food for its employees and consumer electronics for its customers. In an effort to tackle the waste associated with these types of things, the search engine giant Tuesday launched a new goal to become more ""circular"" — to focus on designing out waste in its processes and maximizing the reuse of the stuff in its systems.

At the debut of the GreenBiz Circularity conference Tuesday in Minneapolis, Google Chief Sustainability Officer Kate Brandt unveiled Google's new plan, and an accompanying white paper (PDF), about the topic. ""We want a circular Google in a sustainable world. Now, of course, getting there is as inspiring as it is daunting. It means the entire system needs to change,"" Brandt said during the opening plenary session for Circularity 19.

Google isn't alone. If you've never heard the term ""circular economy,"" it's time to wake up to one of the biggest sustainability trends confronting companies around the world.

The phrase circular economy describes the effort across industries from fashion to food to packaging to redesign the way that finite resources are used and to ensure that materials are kept in reuse for as long as possible. The core idea is that ""waste does not exist in nature. ... Why not redesign the world around us and make sure products are kept in reuse?"" explained Ashima Sukhdev, program lead for the Government and Cities Program at Ellen MacArthur Foundation, during a kickoff talk at Circularity 19.

There are three reasons why businesses like the idea of the circular economy, Sukhdev said: It's profitable; it engages communities; and it's about innovation.

Moving from a linear system to a circular one makes good business sense for many companies. In fact, lots of companies are already adopting circular practices; they just don't always call them that.

For example, industrial giant Caterpillar launched a remanufacturing factory gear business back in the 1970s before it was hip. An oft-cited figure lending new urgency to the concept is Accenture's estimate that transitioning to a circular economy could generate $4.5 trillion in new economic output by 2030 (PDF)

Building circular systems can engage communities in unique ways, Sukhdev said. She pointed to The Plant, a former meatpacking building in an industrial neighborhood of Chicago, which now houses a dozen small food and agricultural businesses that use waste streams of companies as inputs for others (such as using beer waste to grow mushrooms).

The companies that operate in The Plant are also an example of another really attractive aspect of the circular economy: It will be created and enabled by technology and design innovation. The circular economy will tap into companies that are developing new ways to reuse products, as well as the creation of new tools, such as artificial intelligence, that can be trained to maximize resources.

That's a big reason why Google feels inspired by the topic. ""Waste is a data problem. What if we saw stuff as information? This is an inspiring question to us at Google. We love a good data challenge,"" said Google's Brandt.

The complicated world of recycling is already benefiting from AI. Recycling facilities in Colorado, Japan and Europe are turning to sensors, smart robots and vision systems fortified with machine learning software to speed up the rate of sorting goods and improve the accuracy of identifying certain materials.

While the circular economy is generating excitement in the business world, the problem that closed loops systems are trying to solve is also a little overwhelming.

""We have dramatically underestimated the impact of this material flow. ... We have a tsunami of plastics coming onto the market and over the horizon,"" pointed out the CEO of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Andrew Morley, during another Circularity 19 plenary session.",United States,2019.06
877,Can the circular economy end the era of 'throwaway living'? | Greenbiz,"In 1955, LIFE magazine ran an ad promoting ""Throwaway Living,"" encouraging the use of disposable items as a way to help cut down on household chores.

We used to depend on plastic, and now our planet is being suffocated by it. Environmental impacts are showing the need for a more circular economy, and businesses are responding by offering innovative solutions, such as new products, packaging and business models, to address resource scarcity and climate risk — not to mention unlock a $4.5 trillion economic opportunity.

I recently caught up with Brendan Edgerton, director of circular economy at the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and an EDF Climate Corps alum, about the progress being made toward circular models of design and production.

We use the term ""circularity"" to describe the shift from current linear methods of production and consumption, where products are designed without consideration for what happens after use, to adopting circular models that keep products, components and materials within the economy.

Yesh Pavlik Slenk: How are companies innovating to address resource scarcity and climate risk?

Brendan Edgerton: We generally see three different phases for how companies incorporate circular innovation. The first is process innovation. How do companies improve their operations to become more resource-efficient — whether that's in their water, energy or material consumption?

The second is product innovation. We need to examine the products that we've put out onto the market today, and figure out how we can improve them so that they are more circular. That could be through materials or design.

The last and most difficult phase is business-model innovation. This is where you start seeing products as a service being practiced, like the take-back schemes that enable consumers to return products or packaging after use. It requires a significant shift in how business is done, companies’ relationships with their customers and how you work to collaborate with your value chain. It’s challenging, but it’s where the really interesting innovation is. TerraCycle’s Loop project in partnership with P&G, Unilever and Nestle [and others] is a good example of this. They're flipping the whole model of single use. And they’re designing packaging so it is more valuable.

Pavlik Slenk: What are some barriers for companies beginning to think about circularity?

Edgerton: One of the biggest challenges we see today is the general education and understanding of what circular economy is. It can be quite vague, and it's not until you speak one-on-one with a company and do a deep dive into tangible strategies of the value chain that it becomes clear where their opportunities lie and what aspect of circular economy fits into their corporate strategy.

There are also challenges around policy and regulation. Policies were written for a certain time and with a certain economic assumption that everything will be harvested from the planet and will end up in landfills. A lot of these regulations, such as the definition of waste, differs from city to city. Being able to transfer products or byproducts after use might be challenging, particularly if you're trying to carry it across a border of some sort.

You can’t overprescribe and dictate what needs to be included. What’s important is ensuring that the core principles are there. Finally, there are financing challenges. Changes in business models mean changes in accounting practices and how projects or initiatives are financed. Banks and equity investors are already looking into how they’ll need to change practices to accommodate a circular model.

Pavlik Slenk: How has momentum for circularity grown?

Edgerton: Companies are becoming more mature as far as what questions they’re asking and what they're trying to do.

When I first started at WBCSD, we wouldn't have been able to get five companies together to talk about circular economy, and if we did, the conversation would purely be around recycling or waste management. Fast forward to the beginning of last year when we launched Factor10, our flagship circular-economy program. We had over 30 companies committed, representing over $1.3 trillion in annual turnover. That momentum has continued to grow, and this year, we have 40 companies from 17 countries and 15 industries participating in Factor10.

Beyond that, we have over 60 global network partners that share our vision and mission. And they too, are increasingly developing programs around circular economy and sharing their insights that they’re capturing on a more local level.

Pavlik Slenk: Do you see a role for a common framework or a consensus around circularity?

Edgerton: It’s a balance. While it'd be great to have one common definition, that's just not the case. It has to be material to the core strategy of each unique business — you can’t overprescribe and dictate what needs to be included. What’s important is ensuring that the core principles are there.

We’re striving for that balance now as we working with over two dozen companies in developing a common framework for measuring a company’s performance in the circular economy. The goal is to inform internal decision-making and allow companies to understand the opportunities and risks that they have, based on how circular they are today.",United States,2019.06
878,"Circular Economy likely to Generate 1.4 crore Jobs in 5-7 years, Says, NITI Ayog CEO","Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

In the ‘3rd Edition of Circular Economy Symposium 2019’ organised by FICCI, the CEO of NITI Ayog made a significant announcement. Amitabh Kant announced that Circular Economy has the potential to generate 1.4 crore jobs in the next 5-7 years and create lakhs of new entrepreneurs.

What is the Circular Economy?

As opposed to a linear economy, circular economy is an alternative to a traditional linear economy (make, use, dispose) in which we keep resources in use for as long as possible, extract the maximum value from them whilst in use, then recover and regenerate products and materials at the end of each service life, according to WRAP.

This kind of economy ensures the minimum waste and fuller utilization of resources.

Kant further highlighted that by 2050, the world population would reach 9.7 billion of which 3 billion people would prosper to middle class consumption level. This, he said, would require 71 per cent more resources per capita, thereby raising total mineral and material demand from 50 billion tonnes in 2014 to 130 billion tonnes in 2050.

Amitabh Kant added a significant point that has been the need of the hour. He said that the ‘End of Life Vehicle’ policy was implemented with dated emission standards then by 2021, over 22 million vehicles will be off the road. This would include 80 per cent two-wheelers, 14 per cent cars, and 3 per cent each of three-wheelers and commercial vehicles. “End of Life Vehicles present a huge business opportunity for growth, wealth creation and jobs,” he elaborated.

Having 22 million vehicles off-road will ease out many creases in the realm of environmental problems, entrepreneurship, employment etc.

The role of non-government organizations is crucial here and Kant emphasized of their crucial role in the event.

He stressed upon the need for promoting non-government organizations to spread awareness and developing Circular Economy as a national agenda. “This initiative should be firmly supported as these non-government organisations operate at the grass-roots level and can be useful agents of change,” he said.",United States,2019.06
879,Peru Presents PepsiCo’s ‘Recycling with Purpose’ to Promote Circular Economy,"Peru has become the first country to implement PepsiCo’s Recycling with Purpose circular economy model. The program was announced earlier this year as one that would be rolled out in 10 countries over the next two years; Peru is the first to put the PepsiCo program into place, complete with a consumer engagement program and a push to involve grassroots recyclers to strengthen local recycling.

PepsiCo has been actively involved in the recycling arena in Latin America, and Recycling with Purpose incorporates the learnings from that involvement to help build a circular economy “where the plastics never become waste,” the PepsiCo Latin America says.

The company describes Recycling with Purpose as a circular economy model for Latin America based on consumer involvement and education, inclusive recycling, and strengthening of the local recycling industry.

In order to improve local recycling, the company says it must work with grassroots recyclers to help them become integrated into municipal waste management systems and involve them in the push for a circular economy. In this regard, PepsiCo Latin America has a long-standing partnership with the non-governmental organization Ciudad Saludable, a catalyst of the recycling ecosystem in Peru. Since 2008, Ciudad Saludable, with PepsiCo’s support, has trained 3,162 grassroots recyclers and 210 public workers, reaching 22 municipalities with access to environmental management tools.

PepsiCo’s nonprofit arm, The PepsiCo Foundation, has awarded a $2 million USD grant to Ciudad Saludable to support the inclusion of 1,000 grassroots recyclers in recycling collection routes across eight countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Guatemala, Jamaica, Mexico, and Peru). The program is also expected to indirectly benefit 800,000 people at the community level with improved recycling services and aims to collect 6,000 tons of recyclable materials.

By 2021, the company expects Recycling with Purpose to be operating in 10 countries in Latin America, including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Guatemala and Jamaica.

For the consumer portion of the program, PepsiCo Latin America is partnering with ecoins, an initiative that was founded in Costa Rica that aims to increase the collection of PET materials. The program allows consumers to exchange their plastic materials for ecoins, a virtual currency, which they can then use to earn discounts on a variety of products and services. Ecoins was launched in 2018 in response to an increasing demand from consumers to be active in solving environmental problems – particularly in countries that lack an adequate system of separation, collection and recovery of waste.

PepsiCo is focusing on Latin America and the Caribbean in part because recycling rates there are significantly below the global average, the company says.",United States,2019.06

883,‘Good Stuff’ Pop-Up Brings Circular Economy to Life in Manhattan,"Can the results be — in addition to longer lives for the toaster and vacuum — reduced global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and a more equitable economy?

If Sandra Goldmark — Director of Sustainability and Associate Professor of Professional Practice in the theatre department at NYC’s Barnard College, and the owner of the defective appliances — has anything to say about it, the answers will be resounding yeses.

To Goldmark, a circular economy (i.e. consumption of goods that generate zero or little waste, with reuse and repurposing of products becoming the norm) will be “beautiful, sustainable and accessible.”

Her vision for this is on display until June 28 at Good Stuff, a vibrant pop-up installation in Lower Manhattan’s Seaport District that features a plethora of, well, good stuff:
• Hear about the latest progress in advancing a global circular economy from practitioners and experts in a variety of industries — at SB'20 Long Beach. Tell me more! Good new stuff: Innovative, socially and environmentally conscious clothing and home goods.
• Good used stuff: Reclaimed clothing and home goods, and original refashioned designs.
• Good fixes for your stuff: Drop-off repair of lamps, chairs, jewelry and more; plus workshops that teach visitors how to fix their stuff.
• Thoughtful stuff: Panel discussions throughout the four-week event delve into 1) living well in a circular economy, 2) building systemic change through policy and collective action, and 3) how to extend healthier, more sustainable lifestyles to communities that have been largely excluded to this point.

Of course, Good Stuff would not exist without the aforementioned broken appliances.

“It was Spring of 2013,” Goldmark recalled. “I was home on maternity leave with my second son. I couldn’t sleep. And my stuff was breaking all at the same time, it seemed: the toaster, the vacuum and more. I could’ve afforded new stuff but I wanted mine to work! And I didn’t want to propagate the global system of linear consumption — extract, consume, discard — that is creating lasting environmental and social damage. Most importantly, I wanted my kids to grow up in a world that would be less threatened by the negative impacts of manufacturing of tons of new, unnecessary stuff all over the world, which all too quickly becomes trash — to the tune of 150 million tons of landfill annually in the US alone.”

Once she could get her baby to nod off, Goldmark still couldn’t sleep. So, she kept thinking about fixing lamps, vacuums and whatnot. This is not surprising when one considers that the Yale Drama School MFA worked for years as an environmentally minded theatrical set designer in New York. She had gotten sick and tired of filling dumpster after dumpster with stuff, some of which could have been reused or repurposed.

Goldmark’s insomnia — along with some funding from Indiegogo and a small research grant from Barnard — led to the birth of Fixup, a pop-up repair shop launched with her husband, Michael Banta. The shop opened for the month of June 2013 in her northern Manhattan neighborhood of Inwood, in an empty storefront that had been a pharmacy.

Fixup was an immediate hit: In that one month, Goldmark, Banta and others fixed 500 items, from lamps, jewelry and ceramics to small furniture and more — and the press followed.

“Michael and I were interviewed on MSNBC after our first Fixup, as exemplars of a nascent ‘Stuff Movement’,” Goldmark marveled. “I did a TEDx talk in 2014. A potential investor got in touch and asked, ‘What would you do with a million dollars?’ I didn’t have a great answer at that time — I was just running this one tiny, experimental shop — but I saw there could be potential on a big scale for new revenue models that include reuse, repair and maintenance.”

Christmas 2013 saw Goldmark and Banta run a more ship-shape Fixup. They raised prices a bit, which allowed them to pay their workers $20 per hour. Business was good and Fixup’s small profit was earmarked to fund the next one. Between 2014 and 2018, Fixup ran two to three month-long pop-ups each year.

The thing is, Goldmark has far bigger ambitions. She wants to play a role in scrapping the core, linear-consumption-oriented business model that has dominated the world since the Industrial Revolution. In its place would be a scaled-up circular economy.

Good Stuff serves as Goldmark’s next step: “It came to my mind last fall. I thought we needed to go beyond repair — to connect the dots on the full cycle of consumption. So, I thought about a venue that would also be suitable to offer good used and upcycled stuff. Good new products, made to last longer and formatted for reuse, would also be welcomed.”

Goldmark sprang into action. A vacant 2,200-square-foot, two-story space on the heavily foot-trafficked Front Street in the heart of Seaport was secured in February.

Knowing that Good Stuff would be a much bigger undertaking than Fixup and that the space would have to dazzle — in a vintage, lived-in, yet welcoming way — Goldmark sought out partners. Lauren Fay, founder and Executive Director of the New Fashion Initiative, runs her nonprofit to bring awareness about the environmental impact of fashion. When Goldmark approached her with the initial idea, she quickly signed on to co-host the event and develop Good Stuff programming, partnerships and marketing. And like-minded partner brands including Pact, Made in NY Fashion, The Renewal Workshop, Closed Loop Ventures, REI, Make Fashion Circular and Remade in Brooklyn came on board.

The homey vibe Goldmark and Fay were going for was apparent from the moment I entered Good Stuff on its opening Friday night.

Living room and dining room set-ups in the front offered a warm welcome to curious passersby. Shoppers rifled through racks filled with an eclectic selection of Good New and Good Used clothes. The repair shop in the back was being readied for an upcoming workshop.

The evening concluded with a thought-provoking panel discussion, “Redefining growth, or what is the circular economy really all about.” It was packed with 40-50 people, all ready to jump start a circular economy.

The key question is, how do we turn those 40- 50 people into 4,000,000-5,000,000. And that multiplication has to happen quickly: According to the IPCC's 2018 report, humanity has about 12 years to decarbonize by 45 percent if we are to avoid the most calamitous effects of climate change.

Goldmark has long believed “big box” retailers — key facilitators of our stuff problems — need to be big parts of the solutions.

“Back in 2012, I told Michael that Walmart should have a repair shop in every store. Fast-forward to today and you see IKEA management saying that the West has reached ‘peak stuff.’ These big brands are starting to work on these issues. The questions are: What will they do about it, and when?”

In the meantime, Goldmark’s team will figure out what worked at Good Stuff and what didn’t — and then, they will decide how to do it better and much bigger.

884,'Circular Google' to maximize reuse of finite resources,"The goal of a “circular economy” is to minimize waste and maximize the use of finite resources. Google is now setting out to apply this economic system to its operations, products, and supply chains with the “Circular Google” initiative.

After purchasing enough renewable energy to match its global usage in 2017 and 2018, Google set out to switch to round-the-clock carbon-free energy. “Circular Google” fits within that broader vision.
• Design out waste and pollution: Circularity must be incorporated into design from inception, so things created today can become the resources of tomorrow
• Keep products and materials in use: Maximizing product use and reuse helps to preserve embedded energy, labor, and materials, and reduces environmental impact.
• Promote healthy materials and safe chemistry: To keep materials flowing in commerce longer, we must design them to be safe for human and environmental systems, because we can’t change the chemistry of products once we put them out in the world.

“Circular Google” is already in effect with data centers that produce zero-waste. This includes using remanufactured machines, or reselling components that Google is no longer able to use.

At offices, this involves reducing building waste and deconstructing valuable components, like doors, cabinetry, and plumbing fixtures. Cutting down on food waste sees Google compost or donate leftovers when possible. The company’s food program is also focussed on minimizing single-use beverages and other inorganic waste.

Made by Google also plays a role, with the Nest Thermostat E, Google Home, and Chromecast all containing parts with 20%–75% post-consumer recycled plastic. A look at Google’s future consumer electronics and supply chain reveals sub-goals like building “100% of consumer electronic products launching in 2022, and every year after with the inclusion of recycled materials.” By 2023, Google aims to use safer flame retardants and solvents, as well as eliminate antimicrobials.

Speaking at an event organised by industry body Ficci, Kant said that sustainable development and resource circularity is the need of the hour to implement circular economy.

Circular economy implies reusing waste back into the production cycle to produce new products and uses instead of wasting such materials with embedded resources.

Kant said that by 2050, world population would reach 9.7 billion of which 3 billion people would prosper to middle class consumption level.

This would require 71 per cent more resources per capita, thereby raising total mineral and material demand from 50 billion tonnes in 2014 to 130 billion tonnes in 2050, he noted.

898,Policy Brief: SDG Knowledge Weekly: Circular Economy Transitions and Resource Use | SDG Knowledge Hub | IISD,"This week’s SDG Knowledge Weekly reviews publications launched around the 2019 World Circular Economy Forum, which convened from 3-5 June in Helsinki, Finland, on the themes of a fair and just transition; impactful investments; and progressive governance. The SDG Knowledge Hub’s June monthly forecast elaborates on many of the elements on which this brief is based, particularly plastic pollution.

An SDG Knowledge Hub write-up highlights a refrain from the WCEF, that we must shift to “living instead of consuming,” and notes that many participants called for an in-depth assessment of the main barriers to the circular economy transition. Several reports and articles offer examples of how to “live” in transition to a circular economy at regional, national and local levels. A study highlighted at a Sitra-organized side event models how a circular economy will affect jobs and employment opportunities in Finland. The study finds that six main sectors—buildings, textiles, food production, mining, forestry and electronics—all are well-suited to a shift towards circular economy, though each will face different challenges and opportunities. The full results of the research will be released later in 2019, and will include suggestions for how other governments can help workers find inclusive, circular employment.

On the margins of the WCEF, the Asia-Europe Environment Forum launched a publication titled, ‘Closing the loop: ASEM’s transition towards achieving a circular economy,’ which is a product of the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) research on SDG 12 (responsible production and consumption). The paper provides a bird’s-eye view of how ASEM partner countries can approach implementation of SDG 12, including integration of the Goal’s targets into national strategies, target-setting and translation, and monitoring activities. Key messages highlight the importance of public procurement practices, the broader role of governments and businesses, and considerations for choosing indicators and metrics against which progress will be measured. Information on circular economy strategies in partner countries’ national development strategies is available in the paper’s annex, along with relevant sectoral strategies, and identified targets and indicators that link to SDG 12. Information on the launch event is available here.

Also on procurement, the Recycling Council of Ontario hosted the Circular Procurement Summit from 11-13 June 2019, on the theme of advancing the circular economy through public sector purchasing.

A T20 policy brief authored by researchers the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) and the University of Tokyo outlines six proposals for Group of 20 (G20) countries on policies to mainstream circular economy and society. The proposals underscore the need to: 1) capture the momentum raised by public attention on marine plastic pollution; 2) raise the level of ambition of extended producer responsibility (EPR); 3) provide policy support for circular economy business models; 4) promote regional circulating and ecological spheres to enhance bottom-up initiatives at local level; 5) enhance international policy coordination and harmonization for circular economy and society; and 6) incorporate planetary boundaries into the indicators of circular economy and society. For each proposal, the brief provides a rationale and suggested means of implementation.

The Ministry of Environment of Japan and IGES released a synthesis report following the G7 Alliance on Resource Efficiency, covering both the Toyama Framework on Material Cycles (2016) and the Five-year Bologna Roadmap (2017) adopted at G7 Environment Ministers’ Meetings. The report compiles policies and actions that contribute to resource efficiency, circular economy and sustainable materials management, in the areas of plastics, food waste, green public procurement, extension of products’ lifecycles, EPR, and industrial symbiosis. It notes actions that can be taken by the private sector, local governments and cities, and jointly by public-private partnerships (PPPs), and internationally through cooperation.

On plastic pollution and recycling practices at national and regional level, a previously-released IGES policy brief offers proposals to strengthen Japan’s domestic and regional cooperation, particularly in the context of China’s restriction on imports of plastic scrap. The brief reviews trends and issues pertaining to international material recycling routes for plastic scrap exported from Japan. The brief highlights that recycling routes have shifted from China to Southeast and other East Asian countries, and risks of pollution in these countries have escalated as a result. The authors recommend that policymakers in Asian countries develop uniform, standardized and transparent trade standards for plastic scrap in the region, and that policymakers in Japan work to ensure accurate data collection to inform and expand domestic plastic scrap processing and recycling within the country.

The dynamics among countries within a region at varying levels of development adds complexity to plastics, recycling, and broader issues of circularity. A report by Chatham House explores opportunities to coordinate regional trade policies and investment programs to rapidly scale up the circular economy in the developing world. Among its recommendations, the paper calls on: national governments to identify synergies between a circular economy and existing development plans, rather than develop a separate “circular economy strategy;” donors to support circular economy as an industrial development strategy; international institutions and regional fora to engage in knowledge sharing and support; and the EU and China, under the auspices of their MoU, to establish deeper dialogues with developing countries. A write-up of the report is also available on BusinessGreen.

Also focusing on the regional levels, the first Great Lakes Circular Economy Forum is being convened from 25-26 June 2019, in Toronto, Canada, by the UN Environment Programme North America, the City of Toronto, and the Council of the Great Lakes Region. The forum aims to apply the circular economy to North America’s Great Lakes region, highlight the roles of government and business / industry in advancing circular engagement, and address cross-cutting themes of equity and social inclusion, the roles of technology and big data, investment challenges and opportunities, and the role of First Nations and indigenous peoples.

At the local/city level, a report and blog from Circle Economy describe how Prague, Czech Republic can begin its “circular transition.” The study, conducted with INCIEN, identifies areas of opportunity to kick-start circularity, noting that households, the construction sector and waste management systems offer key starting points. The report conducts a material flow analysis for each area, and provides an action plan, such as deconstruction criteria for the construction sector and waste biomass to bio-based compressed natural gas (CNG) in the utilities sector. The project and the associated action plans have informed the development of several pilot initiatives in Prague, including the use of biogas.

C40 Cities published a compilation of case studies on municipality-led circular economy transitions, in partnership with the Climate-KIC Circular Cities Project in December 2018. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation released a ‘Circular Economy in Cities’ project guide with Arup in March 2019.

In the corporate world, a variety of solutions, case studies and innovative examples have gained attention. These include Unilever’s efforts to boost recyclability of its packaging, Dell’s development of “pollution ink” that utilizes soot captured from diesel generators, Nike’s principles of circular design (summarized on Sustainable Brands here), and a new 3R Initiative launched by Danone, Veolia, Nestlé and Tetra Pak aimed at standardizing and accelerating corporate action on plastics.

For readers interested in hearing more on circular economy from a business perspective, GreenBiz is hosting Circularity 19 from 18-20 June 2019, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, US. Select sessions and interviews will be livestreamed via Circularity Virtual. In addition, a GreenBiz Insights report on circular economy trends is available for download, as is a separate “edie explains” guide on achieving circularity. An IISD video titled, ‘Green Economy – A Sustainable Relationship’ presents programmes that the EU has implemented in partnership with the UN Environment Programme, on circular economy and related topics.

899,What you should know about the circular economy,"Infinited Fiber Company’s fabric feels similar to denim, although it is perhaps a little smoother, is cheaper to produce and will likely last longer. But the most interesting part is what it’s made out of: dried and discarded husks from agriculture, recycled and reconstituted cardboard and old clothes. The biotech company, a spinoff of the state-owned VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, is one among many concrete examples of what’s known as the circular economy. It’s a mainstream term in Europe, but it doesn’t yet exist in the Canadian lexicon. But the people behind the 2020 World Circular Economy Forum, the first to be held in Canada, are hoping to change that as quickly as possible.

Those same people — Canadian leaders of industry, senior government officials across a range of ministries, academics, heads of environmental groups and others — were out in force in Helsinki last week, at the 2019 edition of the conference. There, they soaked up the debate about how to accelerate sustainable, profitable, zero-waste solutions in an increasingly resource-restricted world. What is it? The circular economy broadly refers to efforts to suppress waste in all stages of production and consumption. Its aim is to decouple the creation of wealth from the consumption of raw material resources by making it more profitable for a company (and an economy) to recover, regenerate and reuse than to draw on virgin resources.
• Ontario pushing through changes to tenancy law as crisis looms
• Union fires back after Ford says long-term care inspectors refused to go into infected homes Indigenous peoples have lived according to such concepts for thousands of years, abiding by laws of nature relating to tides and seasons, waters and ecosystems to ensure longevity, abundance and reciprocity. (The authors of a recent United Nations-backed report on a million-species-extinction threat called on scientists and policymakers to support and partner with Indigenous groups in order to stem the tide of biodiversity loss.) The circular economy idea is to retain the value of products and resources for as long as possible. It aims to reconcile economic growth with environmental benefits.

“When we talk about a circular economy, we’re talking about the economy, the new economy,” said David Hughes, CEO of The Natural Step Canada and co-chair of the Circular Economy Leadership Coalition. ​​“We can live in harmony with nature and have a very vibrant economy, but we have to be able to paint that picture; it’s got to be crystal clear, and then we can say let’s all get there,” he said in an interview on the sidelines of the Helsinki event last week. David Hughes, the co-chair of the Circular Economy Leadership Coalition, is pictured in Helsinki on June 6. Photo by Alastair Sharp The coalition he co-chairs includes major packaged goods company Unilever; retailers Canadian Tire, Walmart, and Loblaws; and Quebec’s Institut de l’environnement, le développement durable et l’économie circulaire (EDDEC). Hughes said that large extractive resource sector companies are also considering coming on board, with mining companies particularly aware that mining for materials already in products is a ""looming opportunity."" Circular economics is a “radical middle” and a “unifying theory” which “seems so elegant in its yin and yang interdependency” between industry and those working to protect the environment, says @davidwhughes from @CELeadershipCA Where did the idea come from? With his 1982 paper “The Product-Life Factor,” the Swiss architect Walter Stahel was one of the early proponents of such a closed-loop system as a way to move toward sustainability while retaining an active and independent private sector. The concept has since gained traction in Europe, where Stahel has worked for both the German government and the European Commission on ways to extend the service-life of products. Countries such as the Netherlands, Finland, Germany and France have all developed roadmaps to greater resource efficiency, which call for those economies to be waste-free and carbon-neutral within decades.

How does it work in practice? In Finland, for example, the country’s large forestry industry is providing discarded tree materials to biotech companies that then extract the cellulose in order to make clothing and packaging. One of the country’s biggest utility companies, the majority state-owned Fortum Oyj, is investing heavily in its Bio2X biomass project, with plans to build a biomill right next to existing facilities in the country and to develop a joint venture in India to divert agricultural waste that would otherwise be burned into yarn from the nearby textile industry.

Fortum says that a cotton field that is replaced with wheat can produce the same amount of textile fibres with less water in addition to its wheat food crop. And Infinited Fiber extracts cellulose from old clothes to produce a biotextile that is 20 percent cheaper than cotton. Their customers include Adidas, Tommy Hilfiger, and H&M. While currently working at a pilot-scale facility within VTT, the company’s chief executive, Petri Alava, is hoping to raise 10 million euros this year to build a larger factory capable of producing 300 tonnes of fabric a year. Cups containing (from left to right) mulched used denim, bleached and cleaned cotton, cellulose pellets, and nitrogen-strengthened bio-cotton yarn ready for threading are seen at Infinited Fiber's facility in Espoo, Finland on June 5. Photo by Alastair Sharp What do the critics say? Some critics of the circular economy model on the anti-capitalist left, meanwhile, say that the circular-economy model is a way for corporations and politicians to sidestep more difficult questions about whether capitalism and its growth ethos is capable of fixing the problems of over-production and consumption that it has created. “Sustainability is driven to its logical conclusion when it is turned into the fetishized content of so-called ‘green’ and ‘ethical’ commodities and thus into the essential part of the discourse (and practice) through which the capitalist political economy organizes and legitimizes itself,” academics Francisco Valenzeula and Steffen Böhm wrote in Ephemera Journal. “When the feeling of an iPhone turning ‘old and slow’ is combined with the feeling of an iPhone being circular or ‘green by design,’ any critical, politicizing impulse in the environment-wary consumer gets repressed by the intense want for the newest iProduct,” they added. “This is because the marketing of the circular leads the consumer to conceive the purchase of Apple commodities as the perfect antidote against Apple’s own wasteful logic. As a result, of course, the manufacture of iProducts becomes more relentless than ever.” Federal Minister for the Environment and Climate Change Catherine McKenna makes an announcement to replace the funding for the 50 Million Tree program recent cancelled by the Ontario Government at the Dominion Arboretum in Ottawa on June 5. Photo by Andrew Meade Will Canada get on board? For Canada to replicate the circular economy advances of Europe (especially the Nordic countries) and some countries in Asia, experts say the country will need to first get over a data hurdle so it knows what it is dealing with. “We don’t have evidence yet about the Canadian context, we’ve got a big gap,” said Stephanie Cairns, director for circular economy at Smart Prosperity Institute, a green economy think tank involving chief executives as well as environmental, Indigenous and labour groups. “One of the big tasks we have ahead of us is to understand how material is flowing in the Canadian economy,” she said. Stephanie Cairns, a leading Canadian climate researcher and director for circular economy at Smart Prosperity Institute, is seen in this undated file photo. Supplied. She said there is good news in the promise of the circular economy for some of Canada’s natural resource industries, but little talk yet about the implications for oil and gas, a subject that would particularly colour the conversation in Alberta. “There is some early thinking on mining,” she said, including around a concept dubbed “'urban mining,” where recycling and repurposing the components of mobile phones and other electronics could become a supplementary activity to their traditional digging. Other sectors that need to rethink and redesign their way of doing business if they are to find a home in the circular economy include manufacturing, consumer goods, construction, food production and petrochemicals. Another challenge Cairns and others identify for the circular economy in Canada is jurisdictional dispute between Canada’s three tiers of government. But proponents say that circular economics may prove equally enticing across a broad swath of the political spectrum. “Hopefully we can get more of a societal and political consensus on this rather than having it become divisive the way the carbon pricing debate has,” said Hughes, who is also CEO of The Natural Step Canada, a sustainability accelerator. “Canada is in its infancy stage,” said Hughes. “Europe is much further ahead. I think there are some Asian countries that are much further ahead. And within Canada, I would say Quebec is probably leading,” he added, noting that research conducted in French could and should be translated to broaden understanding of the specific Canadian context. It is “inspiring and daunting” to see how much progress some northern European countries have made in creating sustainable and circular economic growth, said Mike Wilson, the executive director at the Smart Prosperity Institute. “They have a better understanding of the way that material and resources flow through their economies, so they’re in a better position to optimise that,” he said in an interview in Helsinki last week. “It’s both inspiring and daunting to see how far it is along in some of these Nordic countries.” “We know there is a lot of room for improvement that we can make,” he said Global material resource demand is projected to double by 2060, the Canadian government says, creating enormous pressure on already-stretched supply of all manner of materials. More efficient use of resources can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also lessen humanity’s impact on the land and on biodiversity. According to the United Nations, the extraction and processing of natural resources causes half of global air emissions, and 80 to 90 percent of biodiversity loss. Only 9 percent of materials remain in circulation. For those developing circular businesses, that is seen as an economic opportunity. “Saving the world is a high-value business,” said Pertti Korhonen, the chairman of Business Finland, a trade body promoting Finland’s companies and the country’s attractiveness as a destination for foreign investment.",United States,2019.06
900,Circular economy can generate 1.4 crore jobs in 5-7 years: NITI Aayog CEO,"NEW DELHI (INDIA): Circular economy has potential to create nearly one-and-half crore jobs in next five to seven years and create lakhs of new entrepreneurs, NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said here on Monday.Speaking at ' Circular Economy Symposium 2019 ' organised by FICCI , Kant said that resource circularity and sustainable development are the need of the hour to implement the circular economy.""Circular economy has the potential to generate 1.4 crore jobs in the next 5-7 years & create lakhs of new entrepreneurs. Resource circularity is need of the hour to implement circular economy,"" he said.A circular economy is an alternative to a traditional linear economy (make, use, dispose) in which resources are kept in use for as long as possible, the maximum value is extracted from them whilst in use, the products and materials are recovered and regenerated at the end of each service life. This economic system is aimed at minimising waste and making the most of resources.Kant underlined the need for legislation to promote the circular economy in the country. ""Several countries have recognised the centrality of the circularity as the new paradigm for sustainable development. They have not only embraced the concept of circular economy in their daily life but also brought in regulations to ensure higher compliance and promote more reuse, refurbishment and recycling,"" he said.He said that by 2050, the world population would reach 9.7 billion of which 3 billion people would prosper to middle-class consumption level.This would require 71 per cent more resources per capita, thereby raising total mineral and material demand from 50 billion tonnes in 2014 to 130 billion tonnes in 2050, he noted.The NITI Aayog also stressed on the need for promoting non-government organisations to spread awareness and developing a circular economy as a national agenda.",United States,2019.06
902,Circular economy: An idea worth emulating,"Amitabh Kant, the Niti Aayog CEO, has asked for a legislation to promote a shift towards a circular economy model in the country. The concept means minimising the amount of waste creation in the economy through prolonging the use of durable products and shifting to more and more biodegradable ingredients while making day to day products. This also entails a bigger shift towards renewable energy sources.

Kant’s concerns are completely justified. India will overtake China as the world’s most populated country in less than a decade. This is happening at a time when we expect our growth rate to be above the 7% mark. A combination of these two factors is bound to create a big demand for all kinds of commodities in the country. With continuous innovation in the consumer durable sector, the propensity to generate waste is increasing. As the day to day economy becomes more commercialised, even waste associated with food, such as milk packets and water bottles. are piling up. Solid waste disposal is already an acute crisis in India’s big cities. Status quo is not going to help us solve these issues.

However, any efforts to promote a circular economy model will also generate losers in the economy. Currently, most economic actors generating waste do not have to pay for the economic cost of its disposal. In some cases, it is the government which needs to get its act together. For example, unless people are assured of uninterrupted clean drinking water supply, they are unlikely to abandon packaged water consumption. In some cases, the relationship might not be as straightforward as it seems. The choice between renewable and non-renewable energy cannot ignore the already existing sunk costs in non-renewable production, most of which are leveraged with public sector banks. Perhaps it is these concerns which made Kant count the tangible benefits of circular economy when he said it could also generate almost 15 million jobs.

Reducing the burden of economic development on our environment is no longer a matter of choice. Countries such as India face the tough choice of rolling out a well thought out reform or embracing chaos. One hopes that the Niti Aayog and the government will deliver on this challenge.",United States,2019.06
904,PE recycling accelerates circular economy,"Plastics Recyclers Europe has published a paper identifying the prerequisites for increasing recycling of flexible polyethylene into a high-quality raw material while ensuring a sustainable and cost-effective process.

With the converters’ demand of around nine million tonnes, LLDPE/LDPE is the second biggest resin processed in the EU and consequently demonstrates a high recycling potential. However, today’s recycling rate of this resin is at the level of around 31per cent due to higher targets and higher quality hampered by challenges.

Plastics Recyclers Europe President Ton Emans said: “Plastic film waste is still perceived as a demanding and difficult stream to treat. However, we in Europe have proven that even stretch film recycling is possible. Nonetheless, to reach for the additional quantities from post-consumer packaging, we need a strong commitment of the value chain to work towards making this material fully sustainable.”

The main bottlenecks specified refer to low collection rates and low-quality input materials, lack of design for recycling, and the continuous development of recycling technologies. Harmonised collection and sorting processes at the EU level must be introduced to increase quantity and quality of collected waste, according to the organisation.

Packaging design controls the degree to which packaging can be recycled, as structures and materials which are incompatible with mechanical recycling cause disruptions in a recycling line. Therefore, specific design for recycling guidelines must be followed when manufacturing a product, and when introducing any kind of innovation.

More investments, adequate legislative frameworks, and research is needed to continuously enhance the quality of recycled material, a Plastics Recyclers Europe press release said.

The Single Use Directive obliges stakeholders to take immediate and decisive steps in production and waste management of plastics packaging.",United States,2019.06
905,Q&A: Hitting the plastics inflection point,"Over most of the past couple of decades, the plastics packaging sector was able to assume the municipal recycling structure would evolve alongside it. Innovations in material use would hit the market, and though some of the new items caused troubles for materials recovery facilities and others, local programs were by and large amenable to expand their lists of accepted materials.

However, when China closed its doors to almost all post-consumer plastic imports at the start of 2018, the equation changed dramatically. Programs in some cases began limiting the plastic packaging they’d accept, and the American public was hit with countless mainstream news stories outlining the chaos in markets for recovered resins.

At the same time, documentaries, articles and calls from environmental groups have brought the issue of plastic marine debris into the collective consciousness in powerful new ways. In some cities and states, bans on single-use plastic items have resulted.

How is the wider plastics industry responding to all this? And in what ways are plastics stakeholders looking to re-engage with recycling and other division concepts to try to get a better handle on proper end-of-life management of their materials?

To get some answers, we talked with Haley Lowry, global sustainability director for packaging and specialty plastics at Dow. The following interview was edited for clarity and brevity.

Resource Recycling: Dow is a huge petrochemicals company. Can you briefly explain your touchpoints with plastics, packaging and recycling?

Haley Lowry: We sell plastic pellets or different types of materials that actually go into packaging applications, but we don’t make packaging. We are a materials science and data-driven company. We have a lot of technical research and R&D capabilities, and we’re trying to figure out how to design better products for recycling. That could be enhancing recycled content that is included, or it could be something like our compatibilizer portfolio. This allows you to compatibilize two different types of material to allow for better recyclability.

The conversation around marine debris and plastic pollution has really been elevated over the past couple of years. What is Dow’s strategy to address pollution concerns?

Our strategy is really threefold. One, we don’t believe that plastics in the environment are acceptable. We have to figure out ways to get plastic out of the environment. Then the second pillar is: How do we make plastics more circular? How do we make sure there’s a value associated with them, that they’re not just sitting on the ground? And the third one is really increasing our impact overall with more partnerships. We can’t do this alone; it’s a big issue to tackle globally. So it’s going to take all types of different players.

Can you offer some specific examples of how you’re trying to move forward in those areas?

When it comes to making sure there’s value, a big question is: How do we create end market demand for some of these materials? We have an example with our road technology. In Freeport, Texas [where Dow operates a manufacturing facility], we just launched a new road where we incorporated PCR [post-consumer resin] in the road. So it’s a certain amount of used plastic that can now be built into the road to make the road with higher performance. It’s an end application that can help drive demand. It’s about 2,600 feet of road and used 1,600 pounds of used plastic, equivalent to 120,000 plastic grocery bags. That’s awesome – to be able to say one small part of a road incorporated 120,000 plastic bags. In India, Indonesia and Thailand, we’ve built 40 kilometers of roads with used plastic material. It shows you can have a sustainable economic business model in developing countries as well.

Dow recently helped found the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which includes nearly 40 companies that have collectively pledged $1.5 billion to address the issue. But we haven’t heard too many details on the plan to deploy that money.

The reason you haven’t heard too many specifics is that the CEO of the group hasn’t been put into place yet. That person is being hired, hopefully in the next few months. And the group will be run as a nonprofit – as a separate organization with governance and an entire body of how decisions are made and what projects will be invested in. Once a CEO is announced, we’ll see a lot more coming out of it. But really their pillars are focused on infrastructure, cleanup, innovation and education. I personally expect to see a lot of the investment first coming in areas like Southeast Asia.

Given the massive scope of the marine debris issue, is $1.5 billion enough to make significant impact?

It is a big challenge and a big problem and will take a lot of investments to actually go solve. But this is the first effort really across the entire private sector where companies are saying, “We want to solve this.” And there are other things going on, like Circulate Capital. That’s an investment of $100 million specifically for Southeast Asia to really advance the circular economy and recycling infrastructure. Six companies [including Dow] are founding partners of that. You could say, “Is $100 million enough?” And the answer is no. But we have to catalyze the investment such that it spurs on investment, and right now some of those investable opportunities are smaller – it’s a few million here and a few million there. So, going back to the larger discussion, it’s all an effort to make a first step.

Dow has also helped drive a materials collection effort in South Africa called Project Butterfly. Can you talk about that?

We’re a big partner with an NGO in South Africa called WildTrust. They developed a program where they have “wastepreneurs,” and it’s the coolest thing. They essentially pick people within a community who may be in a poverty situation and they say, “If you go out and collect this many bottles or this much film, we will pay you a certain amount.” And it’s not just them getting cash – they will give people a bank account. WildTrust goes and picks up the material from the collectors, and they convert that into school desks that are used in the local community. Also, they have just invested in a pyrolysis machine, so they can take material back to a fuel source. The project is making sure there’s a demand for the product and also has an emphasis on creating jobs.

Why is Dow focused on work in South Africa?

We have an office in Johannesburg and a big presence. Africa is really the next Asia – it’s where a lot of the growth will be coming from in terms of overall demand, so we wanted to look at how we could invest not only in the business we are operating but in the communities we are participating in.

Let’s bring things back to North America. In 2016, Dow helped launch the Hefty EnergyBag program, which targets wrappers, pouches and other plastics not accepted in most local recycling programs. Residents are asked to put those in a separate bag that is collected with recycling, and the bag is separated from the rest of the stream at the MRF. The material goes to waste-to-energy applications.

We have been successful in three different cities: Omaha, Boise and Atlanta. So we’ve already touched 100,000 households with 245 tons of waste being diverted from landfill. That’s equivalent to about 1,000 barrels of oil. We want to expand that to another 100,000 households this year. So we’re really trying to expand systems that already exist or that need to be created to get it back.

What accounts for the momentum in that program?

Really, the drivers have been the cities. The cities are saying: “We are tired of all this material going to landfill. We want options to be able to collect it and turn it back into value.” You often see cities putting out landfill reduction targets. Here’s a program you could actually implement today that will help you get there.

By earmarking that material for pyrolysis or other types of waste-to-energy, is there a danger that we may be short-circuiting efforts to develop actual mechanical recycling solutions?

Two things I would argue on that. One, you’ve got to collect it first. So putting a collection program in is not a bad thing, regardless of where the material goes. Now what end markets you choose to put it in – that can be evolved over time. Secondly, I personally believe you’re going to need waste-to-fuel as a viable option. You are going to need all of these options when we’re talking about trying to solve plastics ending up in the environment. The final goal is to make plastics completely circular, but I think we need all options. Putting collected material into road applications or brick applications or building products or to fuel – all are solutions we need to take into consideration.

Do you think the emerging collection of technologies sometimes called chemical recycling fits into that? A number of companies are trying to scale up systems that bring recovered plastics down to the monomer level or process material in other ways that can create feedstocks for new plastics.

We believe these technologies are absolutely going to be critical to a circular economy. That is one of the issues with plastics. They aren’t recycled and recovered as they could be. Part of that is collection and another part is you need to make sure you can utilize that material. If you can mechanically recycle things, that’s great. But if you can’t, what are your other alternatives? If you can make a new plastic material that is incorporating the waste but has the same properties as a virgin material and you can sell it into food applications, that is absolutely huge. That’s a game changer for our entire industry. It’s something we are looking heavily into and have a plan and approach for. We’re at an inflection point for the [plastics] industry to reinvent itself and figure out how you can participate in the recycling market.

That perspective is certainly indicative of actions we’ve seen from a number of virgin resin manufacturers – plastics giants are investing in recycling in many ways. I’m wondering, though, if there might be a tension in those businesses. Dow and other companies have been designed to cost-effectively bring prime plastics to the market, so are they really in the best position to prioritize recycled content and recycled resin technology?

I think it’s another opportunity for another product offering. If you’ve got an offering that’s got recycled content in it, the market needs all of these solutions. So I don’t look at it as a tension. Some of the questions out there are maybe performance-based, like, “Can we use the recycled content or PCR-type of material in all our different types of applications?” The answer today is no – you can’t from a quality standpoint. But could you tomorrow? This is what we pride ourselves on at Dow: material innovation and technology. So to be able to take some of those challenges and handle them through technology and innovation? That’s who we are.

Does that sense of innovation carry through to developing answers for ocean plastics?

I think of some of the technologies Dow has had like Recycle Ready, a technology we’ve had to simplify structures and make them more recyclable. That’s a platform we’ve had for several years and we’re just starting to see a lot more demand for it. … You’ve seen the brands launch all their goals. That has sent a ripple effect through the whole industry, saying, “We have the demand and we want these types of products.” To me, plastics ending up in the environment is an issue that is solvable. We know how to solve this. It’s going to take money and it’s going to take scale and it’s going to take further investment and resources, but it is a problem that’s solvable. That’s one of the most exciting things for me personally to work on – to be able to watch our entire value chain go through an inflection point where we say we can be part of the solution. So not only can you solve a social and environmental problem but also you can make money, you can have a product offering.

Those two things coming together is a really cool opportunity.

907,If You Missed the World Circular Economy Forum 2019 — the Elephant is Still in the Room,"""The World Circular Economy Forum brought together more than 2,000 business leaders, policymakers and experts from around the world to present the best circular economy solutions,"" it states on its website. As such, it reflects the current state of affairs and the direction of the international community towards transitioning to a circular economy. There’s really no better place to be if you crave a rich multi-stakeholder perspective on the topic in the short span of two days.

The Forums’ key messages were ""scale it up,"" ""make it fair and inclusive,"" and ""EU lead the way."" There were other messages, which we’ve tipped toed around, but that present the leverage points and recommendations that could actually get us moving and help scale up the transition.

Crossing through all discussions was recognition that the “old system is bust."" This is because it simply doesn’t take into account the environmental costs or externalities that are inherent to everything we produce and consume. It is profitable for companies to sell twelve suits instead of the two that we really need, or to design products for obsolescence. There are still plenty of financial incentives and subsidies that artificially reduce the price of virgin resources leading to their overuse and making recirculation of secondary materials very difficult to achieve. The moment we start setting up cost structures that recognize the value of natural capital, such as taxing things we want less of (e.g., waste and emissions), subsidizing those that we want more of, leveraging public procurement, and being bold on pricing, our production systems will start to change.

Redefine our approach to value creation

It seems that the most difficult conversation to spin off centered on redefining value. At the moment, value is created through resources extraction and depletion, the success of which is measured through GDP. However, if one were to measure social well-being, that would throw us to the other side of the pendulum. As Janez Potočnik from the International Resource Panel said, “nobody likes the discussion about sufficiency because it’s uncomfortable."" But in the world of increasing consumption, resource efficiency is simply not going to contain us within the planetary boundaries.

A circular economy is one where we use fewer non-renewable resources and carefully manage renewable resources. In other words, it is one in which we align our actions and intentions with the commitments we’ve made for sustainable development when we adopted Agenda 21 way back in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro. Since then, we’ve not moved away from growth to prosperity, and are avoiding the conversation. As Jocelyn Blériot from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation put it, “circular economy principles cannot just be slotted in the current economy — we’re not really making progress where the bulk of consumption is happening, that’s why we need to touch the boundary conditions and open the discussion on the fundamentals”.

That will require a massive collaboration and co-creation effort, bringing key stakeholders and decision makers around one table in a truly multi-stakeholder dialogue, thinking of the world we want to live in and understanding what stands in the way of achieving it, and setting up standards, metrics, and guidelines that will guide us in the right direction of the transition, fair and inclusive, and help us track progress.

Another difficult one. As Stientje van Veldhoven, the Minister of the Environment in the Netherlands, said it in her opening speech, “no government is going to prohibit its citizens from fulfilling their material needs and wishes if they have the means to."" In other words, political decisions sometimes make for difficult transitions. However, hard as it is to confront, but with current 2.7 Earths consumption patterns, we need some consumption floors and ceilings. If we are to scale things up, business needs clear and predictable policy that creates a level playing field for all — and that’s the role of public officers.

At the same, for most countries that are yet to consume and enroll in the lifestyles and affluence we are lavished with in the developed world, strong policy presents an opportunity to design good regenerative systems from the beginning, instead of coming back at the problem once it’s been created.

Consumer is king. But he also often doesn’t know what’s good or bad for the environment, or has the means/wish to change his behavior. How do you move the tectonic plate that is the consumer demand for business to have the reason to change the way it satisfies this demand? Indeed, somebody forcing a limit on how much and what things I can enjoy is difficult, but raising my awareness is easier.

Peter Bakker, from the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, gave great examples why plastic and food waste have become catalyzers for action at an unprecedented level before — “we feel guilty seeing photos of whales choked on plastic or food waste!” Through these examples we see direct consequences of our daily routine actions and behaviors. Finding smart and specific examples like these for each sector — travel, construction, entertainment, etc. — and raising awareness and giving the media coverage they deserve, could move the needle on consumer behavior.

We are in a global emergency, with time really running out. But as Janez Potočnik said, “we are still on the right side of history — it gives a lot of energy.""

908,World Circular Economy Forum 2019 Wraps Up in Finland: Next Step Canada,"World Circular Economy Forum 2019 Wraps Up in Finland: Next Step Canada

This month, representatives from The Natural Step’s teams around the world were at the World Circular Economy Forum #WCEF2019, which took place in Helsinki, Finland on 3-5 June. The event brought together over 2200 of the world’s top business leaders, policymakers, researchers and innovators working to implement the circular economy globally. Topics ranged from plastics, construction, and textiles, to promising circular product-service concepts to policy frameworks and how to measure circularity. (Tip: Sitra has made available several resources and recordings, accessible here).

We were pleased to note the calls to urgently “bend the trend” and take radical action in light of recent reports about climate change, species extinction, and interconnected global risks. Another theme was increasing recognition that we must address the systems driving fundamentally unsustainable production and consumption patterns. To do this requires a breakthrough mindset and effective ways of working together around common goals.

The good news is that solutions and methods to do this already exist. One of them is called backcasting, an approach advocated by The Natural Step. To share our experiences in applying backcasting from sustainability principles, The Natural Step International hosted a dedicated side event to the Forum on the topic: “Circular and Sustainable”.

The event, arranged in collaboration with NELIS, Next Leaders Initiative for Sustainability, explored the questions “does circular = sustainable?” and “what type of leadership is needed to ensure we aim for truly circular and sustainable business within a safe operating space for humanity?” A number of cases from The Natural Step’s global network were presented to demonstrate how the backcasting process is helping our clients connect the dots between circular economy and sustainability:
• Richard Blume shared insights on how a common roadmap is helping the European PVC industry secure its place in the circular economy and overcome key sustainability challenges (more about the case here).
• Lin Zhang shared lessons on challenges to improving circularity in the textile industry in China.
• Outi Ugas explored the topic of data management in the transition from linear to circular and showcased how circular economy content is now available in a new digital platform for companies, SustainOnline.
• Antonio Vasconcelos, Executive Director for TNS Portugal went to ground with the biological cycle with the inspiring case of Esporão organic wines and olive oil in Portugal (more about this company here).
• Patrik Sandin, Chair of The Natural Step International presented The Natural Step’s Sustainability Transition Lab approach to fostering collaboration around systems change with examples from Israel, Netherlands, China and in particular, Canada.
• Jovin Hurry from NELIS prompted participants to reflect on their own leadership skills to contribute to systems change through personal relationships.

Scaling up the transition through collaboration was another theme addressed at the Forum, including during a parallel side event with the Circular Economy Leadership Coalition. CELC is a national initiative spearheaded by The Natural Step Canada in collaboration with a strong consortium of partners. A number of high-level delegates from Canada were present during the WCEF Forum where it was announced that next year’s Circular Economy Forum #WCEF2020 will be hosted.

On behalf of The Natural Step teams around the world, we want to thank all those working to make a sustainable circular economy a reality. Contact us today if you’ve like to learn more about our work and see you in Canada next year!",United States,2019.06
911,"Financial institutions, private sector urged to take advantage of circular economy","Financial institutions, private sector urged to take advantage of circular economy

Mr Mohammed Adjei Sowah, the Accra Metropolitan Chief Executive has urged financial institutions and the private sector actors to take advantage of the immense economic opportunities in the circular economy.

 

 He said this would go a long way to help mitigate the effects of climate change.

 

 Mr Sowah, who is a Board Member of Global Covenant of Mayors (GCoM) and also a Vice-Chair of C40 Cities, gave the advice when he addressed a Forum on Financing Sustainable African Cities in Johannesburg, South Africa.

 

 It was hosted by C40 Cities’ Financing Sustainable Cities Initiative (FSCI), and supported by the Citi Foundation.

 

 The aim of the Forum was to highlight the huge investment opportunity in Africa and to provide a platform to showcase the potential of Africa’s city-level projects and opportunities available for investment to fight climate change.

 

 Mr Sowah said: “Climate change issues are development issues, we must ensure projects and developments are sustainable. We must also find solutions to financing projects that achieve climate change innovations.

 

 There is a big economic incentive in the circular economy and financial institutions and the private sector actor must rise to the challenge.”

 

 ""We are not short of ideas, we are short of capital, our biggest issue right now is raising finance for sustainable development,"" he added.

 

 The Chief Executive, who was recently named among the “World’s 100 Most Influential People in Climate Change Policy 2019” said in the city of Accra, authorities were partnering the private sector to work towards achieving 50 per cent reduction in waste to landfill.

 

 Mr Sowah emphasised the importance of cities globally paying greater attention to the issue of climate change, saying “environmental issues were at the heart of developmental issues currently. Sustainable issues are development issues.”

 

 “Today, climate change is not an abstract issue, but a development issue in Africa and the world,” he said.

 

 He said the Accra Metropolitan Assembly was aggressively pursuing citizen sensitisation for them to appreciate the linkages between local actions and impacts on environment.

 

 ""May, June, July are rainy seasons in Accra, with possibility of flooding. It’s important for us to explain to residents how our local actions impact on our environment,"" the Chief Executive said.

 

 Herman Mashaba, the Executive Mayor of the City of Johannesburg emphasised the need for developing cities to focus on sustainability, given that they face the brunt of climate change, despite not being the biggest contributors.

 

 He noted that, developing cities faced the challenge of having to expand economic growth, provide water, electricity and other resources, and keep dissent at bay when this does not happen as quickly as residents want.

 

 “Owing to this, the issues of climate change and sustainability are not as big a priority for developing cities as they should be,” he said, adding that “It is integral to put sustainability at the forefront and centre of cities’ daily work.

 

 Other speakers at the forum include Ambassador Bene Lofongo M’poko, Dean of the Diplomatic Corps in South Africa, Jerrod Moodley of Rand Merchant Bank and Val Smith, Managing Director and Global Head, Corporate Sustainability, Citi.",United States,2019.06

It’s no longer the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, it’s now the Great Garbage Ocean. Even the seemingly pristine Monterey Bay has microplastic concentrations that rival the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

Maybe innovators will figure out a breakthrough to clean up microplastics, but in the meantime, we have to turn off the spigot of pollution at the source. California should stop the production and use of single-use plastic.

We’re not going to recycle our way out of this problem.

That’s why we’re urging the legislature to pass the California Circular Economy and Plastic Pollution Reduction Act, Senate Bill 54 and Assembly Bill 1080. These bills would make a big dent in our own plastic pollution, and help California lead the world toward solutions.

913,"Saving the world, one meatless week at a time","MANILA, Philippines — Go meatless even just once a week and save the world!

This was the rallying call of Grade 8 student Myka Nadine Chua of Sophia School in Meycauayan, Bulacan, who represented the Philippines and Asia in the World Circular Economy Forum on June 3 in Helsinki, Finland.

Chua, 13, was one of 10 young speakers who joined students from 70 countries and some 2000 economic leaders, policymakers and industry leaders to discuss, among other topics, how a circular economy — one aimed at minimizing waste and making the most of resources—can lead to a sustainable future.

In the “Voice of the Next Generation: ‘Our Planet, Our Home’” segment of the forum, Chua explained how eating meat causes greenhouse gas emissions.

“The Philippines is one of the Asian countries that include a lot of meat and animal products in their diet … Malaysia and the Philippines are two of the many Asian countries that cut down a lot of trees [to make way] for animal agriculture [or the raising of cattle],” Chua noted.

According to the Philippine Statistics Authority website, agriculture grew by 0.67 percent in the first quarter of 2019, with production increases noted for livestock, poultry and fisheries.

According to the United Nations, livestock is a major contributor to ocean pollution and the depletion of natural resources such as water and land. Eating meat also compromises food security since grains are fed to livestock.

In the “Livestock and Climate Change” article published in World Watch Magazine, livestock and their byproducts were said to account for at least 32.6 billion tons of carbon dioxide a year, or 51 percent of greenhouse gas emitted worldwide every year. These gases absorb and trap infrared radiation and cause heat to be retained in the earth’s atmosphere, making the planet warmer.

To cheers from the audience, Chua said: “We don’t need to be billionaires, superheroes or political leaders. We just have to be ordinary persons who do ordinary things for extraordinary goals like saving Mother Earth. So let us all be earth warriors.”

Chua’s speech moved Sophia School principal and dietitican Ann Regoso Abacan, who said she “got emotional” because going meatless once a week has been the school’s advocacy for the past decade.

Sophia School implements a “Meatless Monday” policy, said Abacan, who was in Finland with Chua.

The practice is based on the three Ks that the school has been promoting — kalusugan (health), kalikasan (environment) and kapayapaan (peace).

In fact, before flying out to Finland, the school celebrated another “Meatless Monday” with its partner, Quorn Philippines, to coincide with the April 22 Earth Day celebration with the theme “Go Meatless for the Animals, Go Meatless for the Environment.”

Other students in the forum spoke of environmental problems in their home countries.

Australia, said Zoe, its student representative, “tends to overconsume things” such as clothing, packaged food and electronic devices. “This can be seen in the 6 tons of textiles thrown out every 10 minutes, the 118,000 plastic bottles and 700,000 tons of e-waste thrown every year in Australia.”

The young African speaker from Botswana spoke of soil erosion, air and water pollution, drought and floods, while students from Mexico and Ecuador raised the lack of efficient public transportation as a problem that people solved by buying more cars.

Chua and fellow Grade 8 student Juan Iñigo Abacan, also of Sophia School, represented the Philippines as well in the annual World Summit of Students for Climate (WSSC) in Finland from May 28 to June 5. The weeklong summit included discussions and the creation of multimedia projects on such themes as mitigation and adaptation to climate change, and the role of forests in one’s home country.

The WSSC exhorts all schools in the world to plant trees every year until 2025, with the ultimate goal of neutralizing the 3 million tons of carbon dioxide emitted daily.",United States,2019.06
914,"Accessing the ASEAN Consumer Market: Toys and Games – Asean, Hong Kong","Across many ASEAN nations in recent years, the toys and game industry has continued to be affected by the increasing popularity of online shopping.

This migration affects some toy categories more than others. E-commerce already dominates the baby and pre-school toys market as parents are the key decision makers in the purchase of these sorts of toys and are inclined to search for these products online to find the best deals.

Despite the rise of e-commerce, bricks-and-mortar stores are still the preferred channel for some categories of toys, especially dolls, superhero action figures, board games, and science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) toys.

Purchases of these sorts of toys and games are highly driven by children’s choice, and parents like to try them out with their kids before buying them. This kind of shopping activity can enhance the bond between parent and child.

Going shopping together for toys is a favourite activity for many families, especially during holiday seasons. Hong Kong toymakers and suppliers eyeing the ASEAN market need to keep aware of developments in both online and offline channels in order not to miss opportunities.

Toys and games specialist stores are a one-stop shop for toys, games, parties and gifts. They remain a preferred option for many ASEAN families shopping for traditional toys for children over three years old – toys such as dolls, action figures, board games and STEM toys.

However, older children and teens in ASEAN are becoming increasingly reliant on their smartphones and social media at an early age. As a result, e-commerce is expected to continue to gain market share as a distribution channel for toys and games.

It is becoming increasingly difficult for offline channels to match the convenience, numerous good deals and vast product ranges offered by online shopping. In response to the growing demand for online shopping, many toys and games specialist stores have created their own online shops to offer convenience and a seamless transition across online and offline channels.

Toys Kingdom – One of the biggest toy chains in Indonesia, with more than 30 stores across the country. Its flagship store in Grand Indonesia offers a complete product range, and comes with impressive in-store decorations and professional sales staff which help to enhance the experience of shopping there.

Kidz Station – Another well-known toy speciality chain with more than 70 stores in the country, housing popular toy brands, such as Hasbro, Disney, Mattel and LEGO. It also sells collections of licensed products including clothing, footwear and stationery.

Multi Toys & Games – Established for nearly 10 years, it focuses on figurines and movie memorabilia. It is an authorised distributor of well-known brands like Bandai, Goodsmile and Kotobukiya. It has retail outlets in several key cities, but also sells through its online store and several online marketplaces.

Toys City – A one-stop shop for kids that sells toys, costumes and stationery through its network of more than 10 stores.

Toys”R”Us – While Toys”R”Us is closing or selling its US and UK stores, its operation in Asia is business as usual, spanning a network of over 400 brick-and-mortar stores across key Asian countries, including Mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. The chain has about 40 stores in Malaysia, mainly concentrated in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur.

Sheldonet Toy Store – Specialises in pop culture toys, figurines, and collectibles from global brands such as FUNKO and Bleacher Creatures.

Toy Garden and Toywiz – Focuses on limited editions of toys and collectibles, especially Toy Biz and Marvel figures. Established in 2004, the store has three outlets throughout Klang Valley. It offers a wide variety of brands, including Hot Toys, Enterbay, Star Wars, Marvel, Transformers, LEGO and Hot Wheels.

Early Learning Centre (ELC) – Became part of the Mothercare company in 2007. ELC provides educational toys for children up to the age of eight. Its products are sold through franchise and wholesale operations across many Asian markets, including Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore.

Toys”R”Us – One of the leading toys chains in Thailand with 10 stores across the country, most of them in Bangkok.

In key cities in Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, online shopping is gaining an ever-increasing share of the toys market. As a result, providing a fantastic in-store experience is critical for toys and games speciality shops. They encourage customers to explore more in the stores by providing demonstrations, hands-on access to the games and toys, and recommendations and assistance from the in-store staff. They look to develop a unique positioning and advertise the aspects that set them apart from other distribution channels.

While most toy shops in ASEAN offer a full range of toys and games, some focus on just one type or category, such as educational toys or figurines. These shops aim to become the primary destination for specific groups of customers shopping for that particular category of toy.

If Hong Kong toymakers can identify toy shops or chains which specialise in selling their products and which match their market positioning, they will have a very good chance of winning orders from those retailers.",United States,2019.06

917,School Notes,"All St. Albert Public School buildings will fly the Pride Flag on Monday in celebration of Pride Week in what could be a first for Alberta.

St. Albert Public board trustees voted Wednesday to declare June 17 to 24 as Pride Week in St. Albert Public Schools. All district buildings and schools will raise the rainbow Pride Flag on June 17, and students and staff will take part in the official St. Albert Pride Festival on June 22.

While board schools have for many years hosted groups and events that support the LGBTQ community, this is the first time that the board has actually declared Pride Week and flown the flag, said St. Albert Public superintendent Krimsen Sumners.

“We believe we are the first school district in Alberta – this is what we’ve been told – to declare Pride Week and raise the Pride Flag at every one of our school buildings,” she said, citing research by board administrators.

The board made this move to support the many students and staffers in the district that are part of the LGBTQ community, Sumners said.

“It’s important we continue to make the statement that we support these kids with whatever they need, whenever they need it.”

Outloud St. Albert executive director Terry Soetaert said in an email that he was very excited by the board’s decision to fly the flag.

“It’s a huge boost to the LGBTQ youth and adults to show that St. Albert does have a place for them.”

One of Canada’s biggest banks threw a national spotlight onto a Paul Kane Métis advocate this week.

Paul Kane student and Métis advocate Hannah Nash was profiled in the Royal Bank of Canada’s 2019 Indigenous Partnership Report, which came out Wednesday. She was interviewed by both Global News Calgary and Windspeaker.com as a result.

The annual report details how RBC works to implement the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, said bank spokesperson William Vu. The bank wanted stories of Indigenous youths to connect to the projects they had supported, and the Métis Nation of Alberta suggested they call Nash, who was their Region 4 youth representative.

The report notes how Nash co-founded St. Albert’s Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women Awareness Walk last year and had been volunteering at National Aboriginal Day events since she was four. It also notes that she hopes to become prime minister by 2046.

Nash is featured in the report’s section on Métis Crossing – a large interpretive site run by the Métis Nation of Alberta near Smoky Lake. (The bank is financing the construction of the site’s new interpretive centre.)

Nash said she has gone to many summer camps at Métis Crossing with her grandmother and siblings to learn about traditional medicines, trapping and other parts of her heritage.

“It really helped me understand what it meant to be Métis.”

Nash said Métis Crossing was an important place for Canadians to learn more about Métis culture and planned to visit it again this summer.

“There’s nothing (else) really like it for the Métis people.”

The report is available on the RBC website.

Team Bellerose has returned from an international climate conference in Finland full of ideas to inspire local action on the global climate crisis.

Brianna Stals, Matthew Tuck, and teacher Clayton Wowk of Bellerose returned earlier this month from the World Summit of Students for Climate Conference in Finland. They were the only Canadians at the event.

Held May 29 to June 5, the conference saw some 235 students and teachers from 70 nations create a five-year plan for schools to address the global climate crisis.

The conference was a whirlwind eight days that saw delegates plant trees, learn about climate change, meet Finnish President Sauli Niinistö, and address the World Circular Economy Forum, which overlapped with the conference, Wowk said.

“It was a really awesome opportunity,” Stals said, particularly when it came to learning about other cultures.

Tuck and Stals said conference delegates agreed to a number of action items to carry out once they went home, such as planting trees to capture heat-trapping pollution, restricting single-use plastics, and teaching school members about climate change.

Stals said she and Tuck planned to put solar panels on the roof of Bellerose and bring reusable forks to the cafeteria. They also hoped to take money earned by the school’s recycling program and use it to help students in deforested areas plant more trees.

Stals said she hoped these student actions would inspire adults and corporations to take action on the climate crisis.

“It is the biggest issue that’s going to face our generation,” Tuck said, and it’s already affecting how we live.

“As the generation that’s eventually going to have to counter it, it’s important we begin to talk about it now.”

A St. Albert-area architecture student now has a shiny silver medal after a big win at this year’s national Skills competition.

Athabasca University student and Bellerose grad Jacob Waldbillig won silver in the post-secondary architectural design and technology competition at the 2019 Skills Canada National Competition held May 28-29 in Halifax.

The Gazette’s research suggests that Waldbillig is the first Albertan to medal in this contest at the post-secondary level since 1998.

The event saw about 550 of Canada’s top student tradespersons compete under tight time limits in about 40 trades, including baking, hairstyling and robotics.

Waldbillig, who lives just outside of St. Albert, said his event saw him create complete architectural drawings for a commercial building in 12 hours – similar to what he did at provincials, except the building was twice as big.

“You have so much to do in so little time,” he said, all while some 7,500 students are touring the competition floor around you checking out the different trades.

919,Waste mgmt stems from circular economy: Experts - Times of India,"This story is from June 15, 2019

Kolkata: Business models hinged on circular economy can hold the key to proper waste management across the state, feel experts assembled at the third edition of a conference on sustainable waste management organised by CII in association with State Pollution Control Board and NKDA in city on Friday. 

The conference saw brainstorming sessions where businessmen as well as representatives from various civic bodies and other government departments exchanged ideas about waste management and its benefits. 

Debashis Sen, additional chief secretary of the state and CMD, WBHIDCO, said, “Behavioural change can go a long way to manage waste. This has to be made into a fun initiative to ensure the involvement of people. Circular economy should now be the norm and replace linear economy.” 

In order to corroborate his view on circular economy, Sen cited the examples of recycling of old clothes and Webel’s certification of used smartphones at affordable prices. 

Members from the business fraternity emphasized the reuse and recycle of waste as raw materials. “Recyclables can be used as seventh resource. We buy scraps from the markets, process and turn them into steel used for our products,” said Suman Sinha of Tata Steel. 

Justice Jayanta Kumar Biswas, former judge, the Calcutta high court, thinks robust system that works “consistently and sustainably” is best done through the government and its agencies. 

T M Dandapet, head (safety and environment), Tata Sponge, discussed how systematic waste management leads to material recovery. “We used to dump it on an 18 acre land till 2016. Later, we started recycling the waste and recovered the land,” he said.",United States,2019.06
920,Bending the line: How better design can transition a linear economy to a circular one | Greenbiz,"Excerpted from ""Mid-Course Correction Revisited: The Story and Legacy of a Radical Industrialist and his Quest for Authentic Change,"" by Ray C. Anderson and John A. Lanier (Chelsea Green Publishing, 2019). All rights reserved.

If you want to keep material from becoming waste, a good place to start is to keep material from becoming a product in the first place. This circular economy practice is called dematerialization, and it comes straight out of the Interface QUEST playbook. By creating the same-quality product with fewer raw material inputs, a business saves money and reduces demand for materials that might end up becoming waste. Dematerialization comes down to being as efficient as possible with what goes into a product.

It is a design challenge — one that Interface’s principal designer, David Oakey, took up. When Ray had his epiphany, Interface carpet tile had at least 24 ounces of face fiber per square yard, and often quite a bit more. David and his team set their sights on driving that number down without sacrificing product performance. In the following years, they have been able to strip out more than 4 ounces per square yard, saving not only material but also the energy that would have been used in manufacturing the superfluous nylon fibers. On top of that, the weight savings generate subsequent fuel savings when Interface products are shipped. David’s hard work generated multiple wins for the company.

Another recent example comes from Starbucks. In 2018, in response to growing public awareness about the massive quantities of single-use plastic straws that are used and disposed of every day, Starbucks announced its intent to stop using plastic straws by 2020. In their place, Starbucks has redesigned the lid they use for cold drinks, making it look like an adult ""sippy cup."" While the new lids use slightly more plastic, the extra plastic is still less compared with the plastic straws, and they are easier to recycle. Less plastic is used for effectively the same user experience.

An important observation about a lot of circular economy practices: Just because they are better, that does not make them the best, so we must keep working on improving. Admittedly, it would be even better if customers brought in their own reusable cup and skipped a single-use cup in the first place. That point brings up an important observation about a lot of circular economy practices. Just because they are better, that does not make them the best, so we must keep working on improving. Still, marginal improvement helps to bend the line.

Dematerialization is also about preparing for a future with rising input costs. In ""The Big Pivot,"" Andrew Winston observed that while commodity prices generally declined in the 20th century, they have tended to increase in real terms this century. In his words, ""Commodity prices, while volatile, are now fundamentally heading higher . . . The imperative to reduce material use is rising. The only practical path for countries and companies that want to keep functioning profitably, or at all, is radical efficiency.""

Circular economy product design is not just about designing for less, but also about designing for long. Resource needs are reduced when a product can last longer and can be used more times. I will grant you that many consumable goods cannot be designed this way. The last time I checked, I only get to drink a glass of wine once. Durable goods can be designed this way, though, and so we bend the line toward circularity when products are designed for durability and repairability.

Patagonia is an exemplary company when it comes to designing products for the long haul. In his memoir ""Let My People Go Surfing,"" Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard wrote, ""As individual consumers, the single best thing we can do for the planet is to keep our stuff in use longer."" To encourage the repair rather than replacement of their products, Patagonia has a garment repair facility in Nevada, an archive of most fabrics and trims they have used, and online repair guides for their goods. The company wants customers to be ""owners"" rather than ""consumers,"" and Chouinard emphasized the difference. ""Owners are empowered to take responsibility for their purchases — from proper cleaning to repairing, reusing, and sharing. Consumers take, make, dispose and repeat — a pattern that is driving us toward ecological bankruptcy.""

To encourage the repair rather than replacement of their products, Patagonia has a garment repair facility, an archive of most fabrics and trims they have used, and online repair guides for their goods. Many CEOs might shudder at the thought of discouraging customers from making an additional purchase from their company. I think this reaction is shortsighted, though. Durable goods can command a price premium, and offering repairability for a fee can diversify revenue streams for the business. Encouraging customers to trade in their products, as Patagonia does, can also allow businesses to generate multiple sales from one product. Further, as more customers become sensitive to environmental issues, companies that have an environmental ethic have a market-share advantage. Finally, when customers need to purchase a new product, they’re more likely to return to the company that has provided them with high-quality goods in the past.

When simple repairs are not possible, the next best option is to remanufacture or refurbish durable goods. This is also a design challenge, in that both products and business models can be designed to make refurbishing easier. Doing so reduces energy and material demand, just as Walter Stahel observed in 1976. This practice can be particularly valuable for businesses in the electronics industry. Hardware and software advancements are incredibly rapid today, so refurbishing devices with the latest capabilities offers an opportunity to sell an even better product than the first one that was sold, while still using many of the original components.

When even the most durable product reaches the end of its useful life, we need it to be designed for disassembly. Doing so would be a significant enabler of the recycling industry, which needs material types to be properly sorted in order for them to be recycled. Plenty of products end up in landfills simply because the plastics and metals cannot be easily pulled apart. There is opportunity for value creation here as well, as a lot of high-demand materials could have resale value if producers and consumers could easily disassemble products.

From dematerialization to durability to disassembly, products can be designed for the circular economy. From dematerialization to durability to disassembly, products can be designed for the circular economy. All of this comes with a hidden benefit as well: It helps enable the transition to renewable energy. Let me connect the dots, with Andrew Morlet’s help.

""Think about an engine in a car,"" Andrew said. ""You have a massive amount of embedded energy and resource intensity in that engine, everything that was used to make it. If you keep it in use longer and you can remanufacture it, you retain that energy. Embedded energy is all around us, and the more you can keep an engine, a phone, a table, or a building in use, the more of that embedded energy that stays in use. You lower the demand for energy in the system.""

This logic is similar to that for energy-efficiency improvements. From a global warming standpoint, reducing the need for fossil fuel energy through efficiency improvement is effectively equivalent to replacing the fossil fuels with wind and solar power. From a financial standpoint, many energy-efficiency improvements have a faster return on investment than wind and solar. That makes energy efficiency an attractive renewable energy investment opportunity, and the same can be said for the circular economy.

Capturing the value of embedded energy could be a new frontier for our energy-intensive economic system.",United States,2019.06
921,Mainichi interview: EU commissioner calls to consider binding int'l plastic waste treaty,"Below is the text of an interview with European Union Commissioner Karmenu Vella ahead of the G-20 Energy and Environment Ministers' Meeting taking place in Karuizawa, in the central Japan prefecture of Nagano, on June 15-16, 2019. It has been edited for length and clarity.

Mainichi: The EU became the first region in the world to introduce a comprehensive strategy for plastic waste. What other plans would you put forward to tackle marine plastic pollution at the G-20 meeting?

Karmenu Vella: We are indeed proud to be leading the way on plastics, and are encouraged to see the world following suit. The European Union's strategy on plastics is part of an overall EU strategy for the transition to a circular economy, which makes sense for the environment as much as for the economy. Our objective is that by 2030 all plastic packaging put on the market should be reusable or recyclable in a cost-effective way. Last month we also adopted new legislation to reduce the impact on the environment of certain single-use plastics products and fishing gear. Together, they constitute 70% of all marine litter items. We are banning products where alternatives to single-use plastic products exist, and for products without straightforward alternatives, the focus is on limiting their use, including through making the producers responsible for their disposal. Finally, we are taking action on microplastics intentionally added to products, e.g. in cosmetics or detergents, and microplastics resulting from the use of products (e.g. tires or textiles) or from primary plastic production (e.g. spills of pre-production plastic pellets).

What we are bringing to the G-20 is the need to embrace a holistic, resource-efficient and circular approach to plastic marine pollution. It targets not only waste management and waste water treatment, but unsustainable consumption and production of plastics, and addresses all sources of plastic litter, including fishing and shipping, microplastics, and in particular single-use plastic products.

For this, efficient and coordinated monitoring of plastic litter and of its impacts are essential. This can be done by implementing the 2017 G-20 Marine Litter Action Plan, including through the G-20 Implementation Framework for Actions on Marine Plastic Litter, proposed by Japan, and in close coordination with other fora where G-20 members participate, including regional seas conventions.

M: Nordic countries are calling for a new legally binding global treaty to beat marine plastic pollution. What is the Commission's position on this? Will non-binding measures be enough for the world to beat plastic pollution?

KV: Whether it comes from street litter, dumping, and packaging, or ships, fishing and aquaculture operations, the sources of plastic litter and microplastics are diverse. And so are the possible responses -- ranging from international political initiatives, regional measures, to legally binding treaties or other legally binding instruments that play a role in limiting marine plastic pollution from sea-based sources.

A recent example of a response that effectively addressed a real need is a decision by the Parties of the Basel Convention to better control international trade in plastic waste. Plastic waste was not subject to any international framework until now, and we have observed in the last decades a huge increase in plastic waste exports to countries that did not have the capacity to deal with it sustainably. This decision will help importing countries to control the types of plastic waste that is sent to them.

Multiple campaigns and efforts are also currently pushing for country action on the reduction and recycling of plastic products, but only a few countries are addressing the prevention side of the problem. The existing responses are fragmented, and do not match the urgency of the problem. In this light, a legally binding instrument to tackle plastic pollution across the full life cycle of plastics indeed merits further consideration.

In the meantime, we should focus on the proper implementation and development of existing tools, such as the recent amendment of the Basel Convention. If applied well, it could drastically reduce marine litter leakage to the environment.

M: Japan and the United States declined to sign the Ocean Plastics Charter at the G-7 Summit in Charlevoix. What is your view on this? Can you expect Japanese leadership to solve the matter as the G-20 chair?

KV: After the G-7 Summit in Charlevoix, two further G-7 meetings have reached full consensus on plastics-related actions -- the G-7 Marine Plastics Litter Innovation Challenge agreed in Halifax last year under Canada's presidency, and its follow up this year in Metz under French presidency. Both have seen the support of all G-7 members, including Japan and the United States.

In Metz, G-7 environment ministers agreed on some fundamental language on plastic pollution. They confirmed the need to better understand microplastic pollution, acknowledged the threat and damage to biodiversity and ecosystems caused by the unsustainable use and disposal of plastic products, highlighted the role of waste prevention; and finally stressed that resource efficiency and circular economy approaches, as well as innovation in reducing plastic waste, should be promoted.

This seems to me a very good and balanced approach for tackling the unsustainable use of plastics, and I do hope that Japan and the United States will support it in the ministerial discussions at the G-20 level in Karuizawa.

The G-20 needs to send a strong signal also in relations to third countries. The way forward is product design to avoid unnecessary plastic in the first place, followed by waste prevention and strict adherence to the waste hierarchy, and only at the end environmentally-sound waste management. After all, this is the Japanese 3Rs approach put in practice.

M: Some Asian countries including Japan and China see building waste-to-energy plants as part of the solution to marine plastics. Do you think burning waste is the right approach?

KV: In the EU, waste management is governed by the application of the waste hierarchy, which is designed to deliver the best overall environmental outcome and guide member states in their decisions. Energy recovery of waste is obviously not the prioritized waste treatment option. We should resort to it only when waste cannot be recycled, so as to avoid burying it in the ground, with all the negative consequences for human health and the environment. Fortunately, there are more and more innovative technological solutions for recycling different types of plastics and avoiding their incineration, landfilling, or worse, plastic littering.

For the prevention of littering, including in the marine environment, information campaigns to raise awareness can do wonders, and so can targeted measures against products that are the main sources of littering.

Waste-to-energy solutions for non-recyclable plastic waste can always be a solution versus disposal in landfills, as long as the process is highly energy-efficient. Dual output solutions like chemical recycling which can yield plastic recyclables and energy should also be considered for their specific benefits.",United States,2019.06

923,"Cracking cheese, Gromit! Wensleydale waste to heat 4,000 homes","The crumbly cheese beloved of TV duo Wallace and Gromit will soon help heat thousands of Yorkshire homes with renewable “green gas” made from cheese waste.

The Wensleydale Creamery has struck a deal to supply the waste whey from its cheese factory to a local bioenergy plant that produces enough renewable biogas to heat 4,000 homes. The Leeming biogas plant, which currently runs on ice-cream residue, will use a process called anaerobic digestion to turn the dairy-based waste into renewable biogas.

This process has been used since the 19th century to capture gases that are created naturally when food waste breaks down. Modern anaerobic digestion plants can inject the gas directly into the local gas grid, and can produce bio-fertiliser too. The project helps tackle a triple sustainability challenge for the UK by shrinking the carbon footprint of energy and reducing waste while helping to develop sustainable farming practices.

The latest bioenergy deal comes as the government prepares to carry out a major overhaul of the UK’s heating system to help cut carbon emissions to meet a 2050 target for a net-zero carbon economy. The Committee on Climate Change, the government’s official advisory body, has warned that food waste should not be allowed to sit in landfill, where it rots to produce carbon-rich methane.

Instead, unavoidable food waste should undergo anaerobic digestion to create a natural gas that can displace the fossil fuels used for heating or electricity generation. The net-zero carbon ambition will also require heavy carbon-cutting from manufacturers and farmers.

David Hartley, the managing director of the Wensleydale Creamery, said the project would bring sustainable environmental and economic benefits to the region. He said: “The whole process of converting local milk to premium cheese and then deriving environmental and economic benefit from the natural by-products is an essential part of our business plan as a proud rural business.”

The firm produces 4,000 tonnes per annum of the cheese – which was awarded protected status by the EU in 2013 – at its dairy in Hawes in the heart of the Yorkshire Dales.

The Leeming bioenergy plant is one of nine across Yorkshire owned by sustainability investor Iona Capital, which estimates that it saves the equivalent of 37,300 tonnes of carbon emissions every year.

Mike Dunn, Iona’s co-founder, said: “Once we have converted the cheese by-product supplied by Wensleydale into sustainable green gas, we can feed what’s left at the end of the process on to neighbouring farmland to improve local topsoil quality. This shows the real impact of the circular economy and the part intelligent investment can play in reducing our carbon emissions.”

The nearby R&R Ice-cream factory, maker of the Cadbury’s Flake and Nobbly Bobbly treats, also supplies the bioenergy plant with residual ice-cream leftover after cleaning its tanks.

Iona Capital has another two anaerobic digestion projects in the pipeline, Dunn said.",United States,2019.06

“There are 6,000 European Union (EU) companies in India, but collaboration does not just mean investment and technology, it should mean beyond,” said Raimund Magis, charge d’Affaires, European Union delegation to India.

Magis was speaking at the inauguration of the one-and-a-half day seminar on Talent Mobility held on June 14 at Conrad Hotel, Pune.

The seminar was organised by the International Labour Organisation, in partnership with the India Centre for Migration . The event was organised in association with National Association of Software and Services Companies and Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture.

Sanjiv Arora , secretary (consular, passport, visa and overseas Indian affairs), ministry of external affairs; Dagmar Walter, director,International Labour Organisation and Prashant Girbane, director general, Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture were also present for the seminar.

The opening day included parallel sessions on information technology and automotive sectors while the second day will focus on Startups and policy landscape for European Union and Indian entrepreneurs.

Girbane said, “Many European Union -based companies are housed in Pune. With those companies came investment, technology as well as talent. The migrant and mobility also happened the other way round . With sectors like IT, Pune also sent it’s talent to European Union countries to further enhance their productivity. When it comes to startups, India is one of the top three countries and Pune is one of the top centres for startups.”

In his keynote address, Arora said, “As India is moving towards becoming a five trillion USD economy before 2025, a well-managed mobility of professionals along the India-European Union corridor would be beneficial for all. The vast reservoir of young, educated and skilled persons in India, is poised to contribute positively to India’s multi-dimensional cooperation with European Union countries.”

He added that the joint declaration on the Common Agenda for Migration and Mobility, signed between India and the European Union and its member states in 2016 is a broad flexible vision document which will enhance mobility of talent.

Magis said that European Union India strategic partnership is decades old and European Union has been the largest trading partner with India. “Talent mobility is not only related to migration. It should start from education and thereby resulting in circular economy of result and talent. We need to integrate talent and opportunities to get benefits for both.”",United States,2019.06
926,Three Out Of Four Aluminium Cans Recycled In The U.K. In 2018 –,"Three out of four aluminium beverage cans in the United Kingdom find their way back into the aluminium value stream, marking an all-time high for aluminium beverage cans. Such was the message from the UK’s Aluminium Packaging Recycling Organisation (Alupro) earlier this week.

According to Alupro, the UK’s 75-percent recycling rate is a significant improvement from the beginning of the decade, with overall aluminium beverage can recycling totaling 54 percent in 2010.

Food and beverage processors increasingly turn to aluminium as a packaging medium per Alupro, with the industry witnessing an 11-percent rise to 52 percent last year. As a result of both increased aluminium usage and increased recycling, the British Isles recycled over 100 metric tons of aluminium that began as food and beverage packaging last year alone.

Executive director of Alupro Rick Hindley noted the high sustainability of aluminium and the British public’s enthusiasm for ensuring that the metal continues to be utilized into the future.

“Aluminium is the perfect example of the circular economy because it can be recycled forever. We know that British consumers want to do their part, so we’re delighted that more cans are being recycled than ever before. Within 60 days the can you recycle could be back on the shelves as another can.”

Alupro credits programs of its own for helping raise aluminium recycling awareness, including MetalMatters and Every Can Counts. The British government is currently working to reform the current producer responsibility system as well, as the large quantities of aluminium recycled by Refuse Derived Fuel outside of Britain are not being credited to the country’s targets. Therefore, as Alupro notes, the numbers published at present represent only a fraction of the true total of recycled aluminium, and future recycling rates are likely to be even greater once reforms are implemented.

With over a quarter century of experience behind them, Alupro is an industry-supported not-for-profit organization established to represent the British aluminium packaging industry. The organization’s membership covers the entirety of the aluminium value chain.",United States,2019.06

932,Take advantage of circular economy - AMA boss to financial institutions,"Take advantage of circular economy - AMA boss to financial institutions

The Chief Executive Officer of the Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA), Mr Mohammed Adjei-Sowah, has challenged financial institutions and private sector actors to take advantage of the immense economic opportunities in the circular economy – an economic system aimed at minimising waste and making the most of resources.

 

 This, according to him, would go a long way to help mitigate the effects of climate change.

 

 Mr Adjei-Sowah who is also a Vice-Chair of C40 Cities was speaking at a Forum on Financing Sustainable African Cities in Johannesburg, South Africa, hosted by C40 Cities’ Financing Sustainable Cities Initiative (FSCI), and supported by the Citi Foundation.

 

 The Forum aims to highlight the huge investment opportunity in Africa, to pave the way for a more sustainable future and provide a platform to showcase the potential of Africa’s city-level projects and opportunities available for investment to fight climate change.

 

 ""Climate change issues are development issues; we must ensure projects and developments are sustainable. We must also find solutions to financing projects that achieve climate change innovations... There is a big economic incentive in the circular economy and financial institutions and private sector actors must rise to the challenge,"" he said.

 

 ""We are not short of ideas, we are short of capital, our biggest issue right now is raising finance for sustainable development,"" Mr Adjei-Sowah, who is also a Board Member of the Global Covenant of Mayor's (GCoM) said.

 

 The mayor, who was recently named among the “World’s 100 Most Influential People in Climate Change Policy 2019” noted that in the city of Accra, the authorities are partnering the private sector to work towards achieving a 50% reduction in waste to landfill.

 

 He also emphasised the importance of cities paying greater attention to the issue of climate change.

 

 “Sustainable issues are development issues”, the mayor said, adding: “Today, climate change is not an abstract issue but a development issue in Africa and the world”.

 

 ""May, June, July are rainy seasons in Accra, with the possibility of flooding. It’s important for us to explain to residents how our local actions impact on our environment,"" he said.

 

 The Executive Mayor of the City of Johannesburg, Herman Mashaba, who also spoke at the forum, emphasised the need for developing cities to focus on sustainability, given that they face the brunt of climate change, despite not being the biggest contributors.

 

 He noted that developing cities are faced with the challenge of expanding economic growth, providing water, electricity and other resources, and keeping dissent at bay when those needs are not made available as quickly as possible.

 

 Owing to this, the issues of climate change and sustainability were not as big a priority for developing cities as they should be, he said.

 

 “It is integral to put sustainability at the forefront and centre of cities’ daily work”, he averred.

933,London-based Sustainable Packaging Provider DS Smith Continues Expansion in North America,"New headquarters in Atlanta will extend the company's global commitment to provide innovative sustainable packaging and solutions

ATLANTA, June 14, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- DS Smith plc (SMDS.L), a leading provider of sustainable packaging, today announces its further expansion in North America with the opening of its new headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. Its growth into the North American market follows its acquisition of Interstate Resources and Corrugated Container Corporation, and The Display Connection.

The company's momentum and leadership in environmental and sustainability stewardship in Europe offers a launchpad for its expansion in North America, and comes at a time when consumers seek more options for sustainable packaging.

DS Smith's closed-loop recycling model – where paper and corrugated is collected, recycled and then used again to make packaging materials – has proven successful in Europe, helping the company to manage more than 5 million tons of recyclable materials every year. The company's expansion into North America is a response to global and local customer requests for similar sustainable packaging solutions in North America.

""We've always thrived on finding innovative ways to help customers achieve more for less – sell more, reduce costs, manage risk and complexity in their supply chain,"" said Miles Roberts, Global CEO of DS Smith. ""For years, we've helped companies across industries—from pharma and consumer packaged goods to retail and e-commerce—to redefine packaging across the world, and this expansion marks a key milestone in our journey to bring our innovative business model to the U.S.""

DS Smith recently reinforced its commitment to the circular economy when it announced a global partnership with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a global thought leader in accelerating the transition to a circular economy. The partnership will advance DS Smith's influence in the circular economy and support innovation across the business, including pilots focusing on urban recycling and carbon-efficiency in e-commerce.

""We see a major opportunity to redefine packaging for the U.S. using our closed-loop system and heritage as a leading innovator in Europe. Our new Atlanta headquarters will help us with that effort,"" said Jim Morgan, President and CEO of DS Smith North America. ""Atlanta is a global hub of activity for the packaging industry and we're excited to bring competitive, challenging career opportunities to this particular market, while having access to some of the country's top talent.""

The headquarters announcement is the most recent expansion announcement for DS Smith in North America in 2019. The first, a groundbreaking milestone for a Greenfield facility in Lebanon, Ind., took place in January. The new headquarters facility is located in the vibrant Buckhead neighborhood of Atlanta, and will serve more than 50 employees in DS Smith's sales, marketing, finance, legal and technical departments. In addition to the Greenfield facility development in Indiana and its headquarters announcement, the company plans to announce additional Greenfield sites and will open its first recycling depot in the near term.

As part of the expansion in North America, the company is also growing its U.S.- based team. In the first half of 2019, DS Smith added a number of new leaders to its North America Packaging and Paper team, and has plans to continue to grow.

936,Upcycled plastic bottles are used to create this durable emergency shelter,"Innovative design start-up Six Miles Across London Limited (small.) has just unveiled an emergency shelter made almost entirely out of upcycled plastic bottles. The Recycled BottleHouse is a pyramid-shaped shelter that was constructed from a bamboo frame covered in discarded plastic bottles.

Recently debuted at the Clerkenwell Design Week, the innovative shelter is an example of how a truly circular economy is feasible with just a little design know-how.

Designed to be used for emergencies in remote parts of the world, the Recycled BottleHouse shelter is made out of low-cost, lightweight and sustainably sourced materials and built to be thermally comfortable. The frame of the structure is made out of thin bamboo rods joined together in the form of a tipi. The frame is then entirely covered with discarded plastic bottles filled with hay to provide privacy to the interior.

For extra stability, the shelter flooring is made out of bottles filled with sand that are burrowed into the landscape. Next, hollow bottles are placed around the main bamboo frame to create four walls with a front door that swings upward. Inside, the space provides protection from both solar radiation and precipitation. The interior also boasts a lantern made from plastic bottles powered by the shelter’s integrated PV panels.

According to small. founder Ricky Sandhu, the emergency shelter was inspired by the need to find feasible and sustainable solutions to the world’s growing plastic problem. Sandhu said, “We believe ‘BottleHouse’ provides a new formula for the world’s growing problem of discarded plastic bottles by transforming them into rapidly deployable, protective and valuable shelters in areas of the world that need them the most and, at the same time, setting a new mission for the rest of the world to think about and contribute to — a new circular economy.”

937,Scrap Collector: Trudeau announces Canadian ban on single-use plastics,"Canada will enact a ban on single-use plastics by 2021, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Monday.

""Canadians know first-hand the impacts of plastic pollution, and are tired of seeing their beaches, parks, streets, and shorelines littered with plastic waste,"" Trudeau said in a statement. ""We have a responsibility to work with our partners to reduce plastic pollution, protect the environment, and create jobs and grow our economy. We owe it to our kids to keep the environment clean and safe for generations to come.""

According to the press release, Canada recycles less than 10% of its plastics and is on track to throw away an estimated $8 billion worth of plastics annually by 2030. The new measures will target ""harmful"" single-use plastics (including bags, straws, cutlery, plates and stirrers) while establishing extended producer responsibility for plastic waste — leading to a potential reduction of 1.8 million metric tons of carbon pollution, billions of dollars in revenue and approximately 42,000 new jobs.

Canada joins a growing list of countries that have enacted similar policies — including members of the European Union, which voted earlier this year to ban about a dozen plastic items. Canada's new measure, the statement asserts, will align with actions being taken in the EU and around the world.

The ban, according to Minister of Environment and Climate Change Catherine McKenna, was spurred by ballooning public awareness of plastic pollution's implications.

""We've all seen the disturbing images of fish, sea turtles, whales, and other wildlife being injured or dying because of plastic garbage in our oceans. Canadians expect us to act,"" Mckenna said in a statement. ""Taking these steps will help create tens of thousands of middle-class jobs and make our economy even stronger — while protecting fish, whales, and other wildlife, and preserving the places we love.""

Trade groups Canadian Plastics Industry Association and Chemistry Industry Association of Canada endorsed the government's stance against plastic pollution — with reservations.

""We would only caution government not to pre-determine the outcome and consider impacts throughout the lifecycle of plastic products and their alternatives,"" they noted in a joint statement. ""Any rush to judgment could have serious implications on industry's ability to create a circular economy for plastics that supports a national zero plastic waste strategy. ""

The global plastics backlash hasn't gone unnoticed south of the Canadian border. U.S. Rep. Alan Lowenthal and Senator Tom Udall urged President Trump last week to develop a federal strategy on plastic waste, citing its ""growing financial burden on state agencies, local governments and taxpayers for remediation.""

""We believe that a well-coordinated and well-funded interagency research plan, coupled with robust investments in our response programs, is essential to address the domestic and global plastic pollution crisis at both a human health level and at an ocean conservation level,"" they wrote in a June 5 letter.

""Many citizens strongly support recycling, but plastics recycling is not a realistic solution to the plastic pollution crisis,"" they added. ""The economic reality is that most waste plastic does not have sufficient value to drive reclaiming it.""

Report identifies plastic pollution ""hotspots"" in the Mediterranean — World Wide Fund for Nature

According to a new World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) report, nearly one-third of the Mediterranean's plastic waste is mismanaged.

The region, currently the world's fourth largest producer of plastic goods, generates 24 million metric tons of plastic waste annually — only 72% of which ends up in a controlled system. The rest — which either remains uncollected or gets tossed in illegal landfills and open dumps — most likely makes its way into rivers and, eventually, the ocean.

The report highlights nine coastal ""hotspots"" of plastic pollution in the Mediterranean — including Barcelona (which leaked approximately 26.1 kg of plastic per person in 2016), Tel Aviv (21.0), Po Delta (18.2) and Valencia (12.9). Egypt was identified as the Mediterranean's largest source of plastic waste, followed by Turkey.

""Our analysis shows that in all Mediterranean countries plastic pollution is the result of failures across the entire plastic life cycle, including production, consumption, waste management, and secondary markets for recycled material,"" the report concludes. ""Therefore action must be taken at all levels to ensure zero leakage of plastic into nature.""

Malaysia made headlines last month when it announced its intent to return 3,300 tons of contaminated plastic scrap imports — and it appears that Indonesia is now following suit.

""The waste that enters Indonesia, which has plastic, is definitely not legal,"" Environment and Forestry Minister Siti Nurbaya said Monday, following news of illegal plastic waste imports to Gresik, East Java. ""And basically the provisions are there, therefore we will perform a re-export.""

In the wake of China's scrap import ban, Indonesia became a global hub for plastic scrap shipments. Central Statistics Agency data showed a 141% increase in plastic scrap imports to Indonesia in 2018 — a spike that, according to GAIA field investigations, has wrought devastating environmental, public health and societal consequences.

Steps for returning the contaminated scrap shipments are currently being discussed. According to Indonesian Center for Environmental Law researcher Fajri Fadillah, existing rules regarding imported waste must be properly monitored and enforced.

""The government needs to re-evaluate companies that have plastic and paper scrap import licenses, to learn whether they are acting in accordance with licensing, and whether their practices pollute the environment,"" he said.",United States,2019.06
938,New California Bill Could Revolutionize How the U.S. Tackles Plastic Pollution •,"The ubiquity of plastic in our lives is leaving a mark — on the geologic record, in remote regions of the Earth, in the bodies of 90 percent of seabirds. Our oceans are a toxic soup, swirling with an estimated 50 million tons of plastic waste. But the tide is changing.

Mounting global pressure to curb plastic pollution is gaining steam. A significant leap came last year with the European Union’s vote to ban single-use plastic items by 2021 and boost bottle recycling 90 percent by 2025. On June 10 Canada announced it would follow Europe’s lead.

In the United States, efforts to reduce plastic waste have so far been piecemeal — bans on specific items, like plastic bags, and only in certain municipalities. But California could help the country take a massive leap forward.

At the end of May, the California Senate passed S.B. 54, the California Circular Economy and Plastic Pollution Reduction Act, introduced by Senator Ben Allen and modeled after the European effort. A day later, the state’s assembly passed identical legislation, A.B. 1080, introduced by Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez. If the bills clear opposite houses and earn the governor’s signature, it will be groundbreaking.

“We haven’t seen anything like this elsewhere in the U.S.,” says Angela Howe, legal director of Surfrider, a nonprofit devoted to clean oceans and beaches, which is part of a coalition of organizations working in support of the legislation and reducing plastic pollution.

The focus of the legislation is on producer responsibility — both reducing the amount of waste generated and making sure what is absolutely necessary is either compostable or recyclable. On average only 9 percent of plastics are recycled in the United States, and that already-modest number is expected to decrease even further as more countries follow China’s lead in closing their doors to waste exports from the United States and elsewhere.

Plastic isn’t just washing up on beaches, it’s piling up at landfills, making the crisis in the country even more urgent and expensive.

As written now the legislation would require manufacturers and retailers in California to reduce the waste generated by single-use packaging and products by 75 percent by 2030 through producing less plastic, recycling more of it, making reusable packaging, or using compostable materials. It would also set guidelines for manufacturers of single-use plastic packaging and products that would ensure that 20 percent of their products are recycled by 2024, 40 percent by 2028, and 75 percent by 2030.

“The single-use plastic crisis is so pervasive that we’re seeing microplastics in the tiniest plankton to the largest whales,” says Ashley Blacow-Draeger, Pacific policy and communications manager at Oceana, which is helping to support the legislation. “It just drives home the message that we can’t recycle our way out of this crisis. We need really strong, bold and timely action now and we don’t have any more time to wait to address the issue.”

Previous efforts to tackle banning or restricting items like foam food containers, plastic bags and plastic straws has been tantamount to winning battles but not winning the war, says Stiv Wilson, director of campaigns for the Story of Stuff, which is producing a film about the global fight against plastic pollution and is a leading coalition partner supporting the legislation.

“If we’re going to fix the system, we have to actually take a systemic approach,” he says.

He admits that regulating the materials economy isn’t as easy as a simple message like banning bags, but it’s the only effective way to tackle the problem.

One of the biggest issues is that there’s simply too much plastic, which is why the bill has an emphasis on source reduction, he says.

“We have to get to a manageable supply to be able to create a reasonable demand,” says Wilson. “Once that lever gets pulled where there is a statutory obligation on a supply chain, all of a sudden you will see investment in that supply chain to meet that demand.”

And that, advocates of the legislation say, should spur investment domestic recycling, build green jobs, and enable companies to develop alternative delivery systems for products meant to create reusability instead of disposability.

The potential benefits would be far-reaching — aiding not just oceans, but wildlife and human health, as well as economies, says Blacow-Draeger.

“It’s shocking how expensive it is for cities and counties to remediate all the single-use plastics waste that is being produced,” she says. “The hope with these pieces of legislation is that they will actually lessen the burden on municipalities and on ratepayers by not producing as much waste to have to process in the future.”

For many industries it would also be a big change.

“It wouldn’t just be the one major plastic bag manufacturer that’s affected,” says Howe. “It’s everything from grocery stores to the natural gas plants that make plastics to retailers and manufacturers.”

Proponents of the legislation say they anticipate pushback from these industries as the bills go through committee in the opposite houses over the next few months. The Plastics Industry Association (PLASTICS) didn’t return a request for comment, but an industry publication, Plastics Today, reported that the association was urging legislators to vote against the bills: “PLASTICS notes that it has attempted to work with the bills’ sponsors ‘to try and redirect the bills toward policies that are proven to reduce litter and increase diversion rates. Unfortunately, we’ve been unable to have the bills amended to a point where we can support them,’” according to the publication.

Wilson says that the comprehensive nature of the legislation is the only way to effectively reduce plastic pollution, and with California being the fifth biggest economy in the world, the impact of this legislation is likely to be felt in other states.

“I think it’s fair to say that we have a history of seeing manufacturers conform to California laws,” he says. “We saw it with auto emissions — it’s a big enough market that it should spur change across the industry.”

For that ripple effect to happen, California first needs to pass its landmark legislation.

The bills will now need to clear the natural resources and appropriations committees in the opposite houses of their origin before having a chance at a floor vote by Sept. 13. If they pass those hurdles and earn the governor’s signature, the legislation would set a high bar for other states.

939,New study finds introduction of deposit on non-alcoholic beverages in Ontario will increase recycling and save millions,"A newly released report, Better Together: How a Deposit Return System will Complement Ontario's Blue Box Program and Enhance the Circular Economy, has found that a 15-cent returnable deposit on non-alcoholic beverage containers in the province would result in over 90% of non-alcoholic beverage containers being collected for recycling. The report was commissioned by circular economy not-for-profit Reloop, and authored by international environmental consultancy Eunomia Research & Consulting. According to the report, the deposit program would not only divert waste from landfill but also reduce beverage container-related litter by around 80%.

The report provides an analysis of an enhanced recycling system that would deliver on the ambition of Ontario's Resource Recovery and Circular Economy Act, passed in 2016, to shift the responsibility of recycling from taxpayers to producers. The proposed system for Ontario would work alongside the existing Blue Box program to increase recycling rates across the province.

The study estimates that introducing a deposit system for non-alcoholic beverage containers would cost $34 millionannually, resulting in a cost of less than a penny ($0.0091) per container returned. Overall, however, the system would generate savings of $12 million, provided that the DRS was combined with an optimized Blue Box program.

Operating an optimized Blue Box program alongside a convenient deposit program for non-alcoholic beverages would reduce the overall cost per tonne of material recycled from $314 to $269 and push up Ontario's packaging recycling rate to around 74% from just under 65% today.

A recent report from the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks, Reducing Litter and Waste in our Communities (March 2019), included DRS as a potential solution to reducing the amount of waste being sent to landfill across the province. DRSs have been proven to reduce roadside litter, increase recycling and increase the supply of recycled material for use in future products. Ontario has been running a successful deposit program for alcoholic beverages through The Beer Store for decades. The proposed system for non-alcoholic beverage containers would supplement this system.

Recent developments internationally have seen a push for higher recycling rates, with the European Union setting the goal of 90% collection for recycling of plastic beverage containers under their new Single Use Plastics Directive. This commitment to addressing plastic pollution was echoed by the Canadian Prime Minister who announced on June 10, a commitment to addressing harmful single use plastics through introduction of bans and collection targets by 2021.

Clarissa Morawski, Managing Director of Reloop, said: ""for over a decade Ontario's container packaging rates have stagnated with a collection rate below 60%, and under 50% when you consider losses which occur after collection. Clearly the existing system needs a boost and DRS is a proven solution, with many global examples of efficiency and highly popular with consumers. This is likely why many European countries which also have comprehensive household recycling are adding DRS to the mix of their resource collection strategies.""

Sarah Edwards, head of Eunomia's New York office and one of the report authors, said: ""the deposit program for non-alcoholic beverage containers has been designed to complement the current Blue Box and deposit program for alcoholic beverages. It is based on producers taking a lead on implementing a program that will be convenient for consumers and deliver high recycling rates at least cost.""

""Deposit return programs work. Every year in Ontario more than 1.5 billion plastic bottles end up in landfills or the environment because we don't have an effective system in place for capturing them. This is unacceptable. This report clearly shows that the best and cheapest way to improve the province's lagging recycling rate is by introducing a deposit return program for plastic bottles. It's no coincidence that return rates on wine and liquor bottles increased by about 20 per cent after they were added to The Beer Store's deposit program. The same is achievable for plastic bottles.""

Chelsea Rochman and Stephanie Borrelle from the Plastic Pollutions Emissions Working Group at the University of Toronto, said:



""Examples from around the world show that effectively run deposit refund schemes (DRS) increase recovery of plastic materials significantly. DRSs simultaneously keep plastics out of the environment and drive up the value of recovered plastic material, thus generating capital that can be used to fund collection and recycling infrastructure that is desperately needed to manage the volume of plastic waste that is generated every year. Ontario has a goal to reduce waste by 50% per person by 2040 - this equates to approximately 100kg of plastic waste - or 7500 plastic water bottles.

To help achieve Ontario's reduction goal, a suite of strategies are needed and DRS is an effective strategy to help keep millions of plastic bottles out of landfill, exported offshore (where the majority does not get recycled), and out of the environment. DRSs not only contribute to the recovery of plastic materials for recycling, but also generate important data that is needed to evaluate where plastic waste is being diverted, and if reductions are being achieved. For the Plastic Pollution Emissions Working Group, such data are crucial for our work, which aims to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation strategies for reducing plastic pollution.""

• The proposed system is based on a 15-cent deposit for non-alcoholic beverage containers, which is expected to result in collection of over 90% of eligible containers.
• This report shows that adding a deposit return system (DRS) for non-alcoholic beverage containers to complement an optimized Blue Box program in Ontario, would recycle an additional 118,000 tonnes of materials every year, and save over $12 million overall.
• The DRS would cost $34 million annually, with each container returned costing less than a penny ($0.0091 per container returned and $0.0082 per container sold in Ontario) making it one of the most cost-efficient deposit return systems across Canada.
• Operating an optimized Blue Box program alongside a convenient deposit program for non-alcoholic beverages would reduce the overall cost per tonne of material recycled from $314 to $269 per tonne and push up Ontario'spackaging recycling rate to around 74%. This excludes material collected through Ontario's existing Deposit Return Program that already covers alcoholic beverages.
• Ontario is one of only two provinces without a deposit on non-alcoholic beverages
• The proposed system will provide over 2,800 return points making it one of the most convenient DRS of any program in Canada.
• Generate 1,500 more direct, indirect and induced jobs in Ontario
• Reduce CO2 GHG emissions by nearly 50,000 tonnes per year (equivalent to about 90,000 people taking a one-way flight from Toronto to Vancouver)
• Reduce beverage container litter by around 80%, contributing to addressing the 10,000 tonnes of plastic waste that pollutes the Great Lakes every year.
• The report includes a thorough proposal for a Deposit Return System that delivers on existing commitments from the Ontario government to shift the responsibility of recycling from taxpayers to producers (through the Resource Recovery and Circular Economy Act of 2016).
• Employment and Economic Impact of Container Deposits - New York (March 2019)

Eunomia modelled the economic and employment benefits of New York State's current Bottle Bill, as well as identifying the potential benefits of modernizing the system to include a wider range of beverage containers.
• A Deposit Refund System for the Czech Republic (January 2019) Eunomia was commissioned by INCIEN to design a DRS for disposable beverage containers across the country. The aim was to identify a workable system that would deliver the 90% recycling rate required by EU environmental legislation.
• Impacts of a Deposit Refund System on Local Authority Waste Services (October 2017)

Eunomia was commissioned in October 2017 to produce a report examining the financial impact a DRS would have on local authority waste services in England by Campaign to Protect Rural England and Keep Britain Tidy, among others. The report found that overall local authorities stand to save between £60,000-£500,000.
• Implementing a Beverage Container DRS for Catalonia (July 2017)

Eunomia also contributed to ENT Environment and Management's plan, commissioned by the Catalan Waste Industry, for a Catalonian deposit scheme, which found that a DRS would increase recycling of beverage containers to just under 95%.
• A Scottish Deposit Refund System (May 2015)

941,Achieving a circular economy begins with the proper sorting of plastic packaging,"A big problem that contributes to low recycling rates both in Europe and North America is the difficulty of sorting. At the consumer level, it requires looking for the triangular symbol, knowing if the local recycler takes all seven numbers or only a few of them, and which ones. If there were an easier way to sort recyclable products, recycling rates would certainly go up.

Plastic packaging represents the biggest share of European plastic demand. However, today only 42% of plastic packaging waste is recycled in Europe, according to Plastics Recyclers Europe (PRE; Brussels). To help boost that number, PRE issued guidance for recycling in order to recapture the true value of packaging and transform it into new high-quality products.

To increase the amount and, more importantly, the quality of recyclate, the industry must focus on optimizing reprocessing of this valuable resource. The quality of the recyclate is directly affected by the quality of the sorting practices, said PRE’s information. It is critical to the recycling process to ensure that the value of packaging materials treated at the sorting facilities is fully optimized to ultimately secure high-quality input for recyclers. To optimize output quality, plastic packaging should be automatically sorted through a series of consecutive steps, said PRE, increasing the efficiency as well as the effectiveness of establishing highly refined waste streams.

Removing contamination and sorting packaging according to polymer types, and optionally by color and product categories, is a prerequisite for securing high-quality recycling input. Furthermore, the guidance advocates standardization as well as harmonization of sorting practices, as this would ensure a more uniform and reliable flow of material toward recycling facilities.

A recent report from AMI Consulting, Plastic Caps and Closures: The European Market 2019, notes that the European closures industry has been proactive for well over a decade in reducing the use of virgin material in both neck finish and closures. Lightweighting has been the most important driver of change. The last industry step-change within beverage closures was the shift toward one-piece beverage caps away from two-piece caps, coinciding with the adoption of the PCO1881 bottle-neck standard. Along with a reduction in the use of raw materials, savings are achieved in energy consumption and CO emissions are reduced.

The focus of the European sustainability agenda is on single-use plastics (SUP), which includes the handling of caps in a circular economy and promoting anti-littering solutions. Article 6 of the Single-Use Plastics Directive drafted in 2018 establishes a new norm requiring closures to be connected/tethered to the bottle. That article was voted on by the European Parliament in March 2019, resulting in another major step change for the European plastic caps and closures industry. The tethered cap regulation will impact plastic beverage bottles under three liters, including composite containers (i.e. cartons). By 2024, all beverage closures will have to be tethered by law.

According to AMI’s report, there are a number of technical variables to consider with a tethered cap, including opening angle, torque, rotation of band, lock-in position and so forth, all of which may result in a different concept. So that the consumer’s drinking experience is not adversely affected, the tethered cap should allow for a wide opening and lock-in position, prevent rotation and be re-closable.",United States,2019.06
943,Speakers at World Circular Economy Forum Call for Shift to “Living Instead of Consuming” | News | SDG Knowledge Hub | IISD,"4 June 2019: “Living instead of consuming” was a popular refrain heard during the 2019 World Circular Economy Forum (WCEF2019), a two-day event attended by more than 2,000 “doers and thinkers” who considered ideas to reduce the overuse of raw materials, stem overconsumption, and move from ownership to sharing, among other goals that fall under the circular economy framework.

WCEF2019, which convened in Helsinki, Finland, from 3-4 June 2019, stressed the urgent need to scale up the circular economy. Participants frequently noted that the time to act is now, as there are opportunities to mainstream circular solutions such in filling the massive global infrastructure gap. In this regard, participants emphasized the private sector’s role in promoting the leap from linearity to circularity.

Participants shared solutions that included actions such as moving away from linear business models, ending perverse economic incentives, mainstreaming the circular economy in trade, encouraging disruption in business, collaborating with the private sector, and educating consumers to change mindsets and behaviors.

During 16 plenary and parallel sessions, panelists highlighted that the transition to the circular economy should become fairer and more inclusive, while supporting the SDGs. Discussions focused on:
• Ways to spread and scale up new technologies; and
• Tools for making significant regulatory changes that enable scaling up the circular economy.

Other key messages included the importance of international trade and investment, as well as broad engagement by governments, the private sector, and consumers.

Speakers highlighted that Finland’s upcoming Presidency of the EU and plans by the European Commission to update its second circular economy plan both present key opportunities to promote circularity. The discussions will continue at the fourth WCEF, to be held in Canada in 2020.

WCEF2019 was a global initiative of the Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra. The event was supported by the European Investment Bank (EIB), Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of Finland, Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment of Finland, Ministry of the Environment of Finland, Nordic Innovation, and partners Climate-KIC, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the European Commission, the European Environment Agency, Helsinki Metropolitan Smart & Clean Foundation, UN Environment Programme (UNEP), and the World Bank.

1,Recycling Won't Be Enough To Save The Planet - What We Need Now Is The Right Recycling,"While there are still a significant number of died-in-the-wool deniers out there, it does seem that most of us have now got the message that we can’t keep treating the planet as if its resources were inexhaustible. And that will mean abandoning the old idea of a ‘linear economy’ where raw materials are extracted from the earth, used to create a product and then thrown away when we have had enough of it. Instead we seem to have finally reached a consensus that we should aim for a ‘circular economy’ (or CE for short) where resources are re-deployed in some way at the end of each stage of use.

Sounds great doesn’t it and eminently sensible? But, of course, nothing ever turns out to be as simple as it might first appear. And the problem we seem to have here is that different people interpret the detail of a circular economy in different ways – a study by Utrecht University in 2017 came up with a staggering 114 definitions and that might be just the tip of the iceberg.

But does this really matter? Oh, yes, most definitely.

In my own work, for example, I regularly come across organisations that are convinced that they are operating on CE principles because they had developed a pay-per-use model instead of the usual ‘buy and own’ one. But, in concentrating their attention on the delivery model, very few look in detail at the product itself and its positive or negative impact on people or the wider environment.

And this, in my own view, is the crux of the matter. Unless we start looking closely at what is in the product and just how recyclable it really is, then no innovative or imaginative delivery model is going to have the beneficial environmental result that we are seeking. Because recycling ‘bad’ materials can only lead to bad outcomes. Or to put it another, slightly cruder way beloved of the IT world – ‘crap in, crap out’.

Let me give you a few concrete, real life examples of what I am talking about.

Does it make sense, for example, to try to make carpets out of recycled PVC when a substantial body of research has linked the material to childhood asthma? Or to reuse leather that has been tanned using chromium which is known to pollute ground water? Or to recycle aluminium into textiles and cosmetics when there is strong evidence that it’s associated with the development of Alzheimer’s disease?

In my opinion, the drive towards a circular economy is not just laudable, it is essential. But no-one in this drive can be allowed to either deceive themselves or others, either deliberately or unconsciously. Only by digging deep into the make-up of a product can we make an informed decision as to the wisdom behind its reuse. Or whether, by recycling, we may actually be causing even more damage to the eco-system and the people within it.",United States,2019.06
2,"Circular solutions, promising processes","Dr Christoph Schumacher, Head of Marketing and Corporate Communications at Arburg GmbH, defends the role of plastics in the circular economy.

Arburg is a machine manufacturer. What are its reasons for supporting a circular economy?

We want to contribute, as far as it is in our power, to the solution of this serious and possibly most important problem of our industry. We are convinced that this challenge cannot be faced by individual members of the value-added chain alone.

But what can Arburg do?

As machine manufacturers, we can help develop new processing techniques and procedures. A classical historic issue is multi-component processing. It shows how new challenges create new techniques, and sometimes new techniques trigger the development of new products. In my view, Arburg is deeply involved in Design for Recycling. We firmly believe that in the next 20 to 30 years the production of plastics will also be oriented towards aspects of recycling, and this is where machine manufacturers are an important factor. We must ensure the production of these parts, and all the time we must bear in mind the common goal of production efficiency for our customers – i.e. to manufacture resource-efficient products with as little material and as little energy as possible.

Will the circular economy help improve the image of plastics?

We hope so. In our opinion, plastics – as a reusable material – are still the material of the 21st century. But we also see the external framework parameters. I think a major problem is the idea that plastics are waste products. Plastic materials do not belong in the oceans or the ditches but in a recycling chain. Mechanical engineering is an enabler; it enables the recycling of plastics. You can argue over the need of packaging a cucumber, but you cannot argue about the necessity of plastics in medical technology and in everything affecting people. In this application everyone demands the highest quality product, for instance, when it comes to infusions or stents.

Is the circular economy, then, more than just a business opportunity?

The whole issue must make sense from an economic point of view. The public would refuse to believe us if we pretended to have missionary aspirations. We are an industry; we actually see a business opportunity in the circular economy. We could sell the value-added cycle all over the world. There are still so many regions where a circular economy does not play any role at all, in many Asian countries, for example, but also in parts of the US.

If we could export the European or the German standard to all these markets, we would have an incredible amount of work from this field alone in the next decades. Arburg has customers who already make money as part of circular economies in countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines, Brazil and also in the US. They collect PET bottles, process them into PET flakes to manufacture PET bottles again.

Whose task will it be to export entire value-added chains to the world?

That's difficult. Circular economy only works if everyone is involved in the value-added chain, but at present there are no such consortiums to serve as an export model. As a rule, such an idea can be successful only if you approach it systematically. All those involved must be convinced, there must be market incentives and legal regulation to define the framework.

What if the EU introduces circular economy and products become more expensive, but competitors from overseas offer them cheaper because they can produce more economically with virgin material?

That would be an inadmissible distortion of competition. If the EU stipulated certain practices by law that other manufacturers in the global market did not adopt, and if as a consequence our markets were not regulated correspondingly, legislators would have to ensure that other competitors operate under the same conditions in these markets. Of course, this would aggravate market chances for European products in countries that do not have the same environmental standards if consumer behaviour does not change in those countries.

What role does the consumer play?

Consumers are an essential lever, but I feel that they cannot really understand the issue at present. This is reflected in the discussion on biodegradable products, for example. Consumers erroneously believe that they are absolutely good and can replace oil-based plastics. They also see pictures of whales with plastic bags in their stomachs or sea turtles in fishing nets, which is why, in a discussion, you don't stand a chance. What I hope for is that the plastics sector, from material manufacturing to the consumers, finds a common definition: That we recognise the circular economy as a common goal and that we then position ourselves correspondingly.",United States,2019.06
5,"Tractors, software and the right to repair | Greenbiz","This article was adapted from the newsletter VERGE Weekly, running Wednesdays. Subscribe here.

During the latest state legislative cycle — which is mostly wound down for this year — lawmakers considered nearly 20 bills centered around a concept known as the ""right to repair.""

None of them actually passed, but the attempt in Minnesota got closer than most. What’s more, advocates in New York (where Apple reportedly gummed up the works) and Massachusetts still actively pursue the issue. This isn’t going away, and now that Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren is talking up the concept, every maker of stuff — both consumer and commercial — should be paying attention.

Don’t make the mistake of writing off right-to-repair campaigns as pet projects of the DIY crowd. I see the movement as directly related to the disruption in traditional business models being catalyzed by the philosophical and operational shift to a circular economy.

One of the central practices really complicating matters is how manufacturers license the software that is increasingly necessary to operate and maintain all manner of products, from tractors to printers. Simply put, most of this software is not available as ""open source,"" and fiddling with it is pretty much verboten for anyone who isn’t authorized — even for the ""owner"" of said thing. So even if the hardware is pretty easy to take apart, doing so might actually breach some sort of intellectual property law. Why? Because the margins on services are still pretty juicy.

I see the movement as directly related to the disruption in traditional business models being catalyzed by the philosophical and operational shift to a circular economy. ""This particular view of eternal locks on everything is an ecological disaster,"" noted Nathan Proctor, director of the Right to Repair campaign with the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (U.S. PIRG), when we chatted earlier this week.

""Our opponents keep enraging their customers,"" he added later during our conversation. ""If they weren’t nickel and diming [them], we wouldn’t have had such an easy time"" getting attention for this issue.

The right-to-repair idea itself is pretty straightforward. The laws being considered from Maine to Nebraska essentially would require manufacturers to make repair resources — that is, the same manuals and components that authorized service and maintenance partners receive — available to individuals who want to fix things on their own.

As GreenBiz circularity maven Lauren Phipps reported in late 2018, DIY electronics sorts have griped about ""locked"" iPhones and the difficulties of disassembling certain types of electronics for years. That even inspired Motorola to take an entirely different and refreshing approach with its mobile phones: creating DIY repair kits. By the way, this is essentially an entirely new product line. Yes, a new revenue stream!

The controversy that has really pushed the right-to-repair issue further into national headlines over the past several years, however, is focused on an entirely different dilemma: the right of farmers to continue repairing tractors and other agricultural equipment, notably made by Caterpillar and John Deere.

This is something that many farmers have been doing for years. After all, who can afford to wait days for an official repairperson in the middle of a crop seeding or harvest? That tractor needs to get back into the field. Stat! But it turns out that all the sensors and software that have been loaded onto these machines — yes, the very tech that we all love to gush about — is increasingly proprietary. The manufacturers have been locking this stuff down in the name of intellectual property rights, essentially forcing them to pay a lot more money for official repairs and are turning some farmers into hackers.

It underscores that more consumers are interested in keeping the products they already own in useful circulation longer than most manufacturers may have anticipated. Things have gotten so heated that the Federal Trade Commission is even holding a mid-July workshop on this issue (aptly called ""Nixing the Fix""). Among the issues it’s exploring: the decision by some manufacturers to made warranties conditional upon someone using an official repair shop, and whether these policies are forcing some products into obsolescence.

The interest in right to repair is revealing. For one thing, it underscores that more consumers — both individuals and businesses — are interested in keeping the products they already own in useful circulation longer than most manufacturers may have anticipated.

So, as companies redesign computers and phones and, yes, equipment such as tractors or warehouse forklifts, the ways they approach modularity will be important. Those decisions will have implications not just for upgradeability but later for disassembly when something truly would be worth more in pieces rather than a whole.

Similarly, many companies will need to rethink their software licensing policies so that the various components of a particular piece of hardware more easily can be used or remanufactured. A model for this is the personal computer industry (well, at least most of them), where companies such as Dell, Lenovo and HP Inc. decouple the electronics from the operating system software (usually supplied by Microsoft). Things aren’t so simple when it comes to disassembling something made by a vertically integrated manufacturer such as Apple or Cisco.

For now, the right to repair is mostly a theory, not a reality. But the push toward a circular economy is likely to keep it front and center legislatively. ""I think it’s inevitable that we’re going to pass the right to repair somewhere,"" Proctor said.",United States,2019.06
7,Business Delegation Tour: The Circular Economy in Action,"A shift from the take-make-waste model to the innovative circular economy model is essential for our planet and our future. It can also serve as an opportunity for companies to create new revenue streams and address resource constraint risks. However, taking the vision of a circular economy, in which everything is reused and nothing is wasted, and translating that into tangible business best practices can be challenging.

This is why, five years ago, CCC started organizing annual business delegation tours, to inspire new ideas and profitable actions that companies can take to eliminate waste by design and achieve a circular economy.

This event brings together business leaders and other industry experts to explore circular opportunities that help decouple economic growth from resource constraints while driving growth, performance, competitiveness, and innovation.

Through hands-on tours of organizations implementing circular strategies and interactive peer-to-peer discussion and networking, attendees are inspired and equipped with clear insights and specific opportunities on which their organizations can capitalize to bring circular solutions to scale.

This tour offers unique access to decision makers with the necessary purchasing power and authority to accelerate the circular economy transition in the U.S. Tours have included participation from JetBlue Airways, Citi, Colgate-Palmolive, Mondelez International, Philips, Subaru, TerraCycle, Tetra Pak, and Walgreens Boots Alliance.

8,Why The Circular Economy Will Not Fix Fashion's Sustainability Problem,"Fashion has a sustainability problem. In 2015 the industry was responsible for the emission of 1,715 million tons of CO2. It’s about 5.4% of the 32.1 billion tons of global carbon emissions and just second after the oil and gas industry. Global apparel and footwear consumption are expected to nearly double in the next 15 years–and so its negative impact on the environment.

In the last several years, the industry and consumers have finally started focusing more on this problem – many initiatives and awareness campaigns have been launched. A big emphasis was and still is, on the circular economy as an alternative to the linear economy.

The circular economy is a system in which resource input and waste, emission, and energy leakage are minimised by slowing, closing, and narrowing energy and material loops. Whereas the linear economy, that is usually defined by a “take-make-dispose” model, often leads to single-use products.

In the fashion context, the circular economy is usually achieved by designing long-lasting, timeless pieces (versus fast fashion’s seasonality) and many ""RE-s:"" repair, reuse, recycle, refurbish to extend the lifetime of an item (from single-use to multiple lives). There are a lot of great examples of circularity in fashion: from consignment services, like Vestiare Collective, TheRealReal, thredUP; a new generation of direct-to-consumer brands focusing on timeless collections with Everlane leading the movement; or collection and recycling programs, for example by Zara and H&M, where shoppers can drop off textile and clothing that they no longer use for brands to recycle.

Good news–this seems to work! The circular economy does move the needle and helps the industry to be more sustainable. For example, H&M’s website now shows that the company currently makes 57% of its products from recycled or “sustainably sourced” materials. Recently, the Pulse of the Fashion Industry report, published by the Global Fashion Agenda, in collaboration with The Boston Consulting Group, mentioned that 12.5% of the global market have set goals in the circular economy area.

So can the circularity be the answer to fashion’s sustainability problem? While it’s indeed a positive trend, I’m afraid it’s not the cure-all. Moreover, it might end up becoming a frontrunner of the greenwashing agenda.

The fashion industry grows by 4-5% every year and is expected to reach $3.3 trillion in 2030 from the projected $1.9 trillion in 2019. This is 1.7x growth in just eleven years.

With these growth rates, it’s impossible and irresponsible to expect circularity to fix the problem. This becomes even bleaker considering that the above-mentioned report admits that the industry’s sustainability efforts are already stalling. This year, the industry’s pulse score rose to 42 out of 100, compared to 38 last year and 32 in 2017. In fact, the report finds that 40% of all fashion companies have not even begun to take sustainability seriously by setting targets and rethinking their supply chain. Among the rest of the 60%, a lot of the improvement is happening with small companies (or those with less than $100 million in revenue per year, which includes many startups) and mid-sized companies (which make less than $1 billion in revenue per year). Among the biggest players in the market, which make billions in revenue every year, the pace of improvement has basically stalled out.

The only way the industry can address the climate catastrophe is to slow the growth. No amount of reusing or recycling will offset the continuous growth of the industry as it stands, so the solution is to simply produce less.

Yes, this is an unpopular opinion, but given the catastrophic impact of climate change, we have no choice but to dramatically change the way the industry operates.

Slowing growth might be less scary if this is achieved by smarter production. A large share of produced fashion never gets sold or kept by a shopper–according to the Ellen McArthur Foundation, 87% of the produced fashion will go on to be landfilled or incinerated. Companies can cut the amount of dead inventory by better understanding what their shoppers want, and forecasting demand more accurately.

The other option is focusing on timeless collections and avoiding the spree of 12 seasons per year. The key is to not produce as much as possible and hope that it will be sold (which it will not be). Last year, H&M alone had $4.3 billion in unsold product, highlighting the issue of waste and the need for corporations to be held accountable to be more accurate in their predictions. The solution should be that businesses need to forecast better and produce fewer items, with a higher certainty of them being sold.

In the fight for our future, the fashion has to be circular but first and foremost it has to slow its growth, forecast what shoppers actually want and cut the overproduction.",United States,2019.06
10,'Milkman Model' Economy Could Create Jobs In Indiana,"This year’s Indiana Recycling Coalition Conference focused less on recycling and more on the other two R’s — reduce and reuse. China’s refusal to take the United States’ low-grade recycling is forcing some communities to think about a more holistic approach.

Keynote speaker Ken Miller is a consultant who worked in the chemical and plastic industries for decades. He says for a long time, everyday people have had to decide what to do with products once they’re done with them — but it shouldn’t be that way.

“Who better to deal with a washing machine that doesn’t work anymore than the person who made it in the first place?” Miller says.

Miller says if companies knew that product would be returned to them one day, they’d make it more durable and reusable. What's more, Miller says this kind of circular economy requires all kinds of jobs — including manufacturing and transportation. Recycling Coalition executive director Allyson Mitchell says Indiana excels at both.

“So I think we are well positioned as a state to add that third ingredient of innovation to take advantage of the infrastructure that we already have,” she says.

Mitchell says Indianapolis’ sustainability plan, Thrive Indianapolis, includes expanding recycling access as well as encouraging investments in these kinds of economies. She says that can look like anything from a traditional milkman service with reusable glass bottles to car sharing services like BlueIndy.

Some companies in Indiana are already looking into ways to turn plastics into fuel for cars and jets. Though Miller warns often these processes require fossil fuels, creating greenhouse gas emissions. He says using renewable energy like wind and solar could help close that loop.

13,Planning to improve Indianapolis recycling,"INDIANAPOLIS (WTHR) - Indianapolis is the largest city in the United States without a universal curbside recycling program.

The city has pledged to change that by 2025 in its Thrive Indianapolis Plan. Increasing recycling is one of the topics at the Indiana Recycling Coalition annual conference at the Indianapolis Marriott East.

The recycling rate in Indy is just 4.3 percent, compared to the national average of 34 percent. The state goal in Indiana is 50 percent.

""Indianapolis has a long history of not having great recycling,” said Allyson Mitchell, executive director of the Indiana Recycling Coalition (IRC). “It's an opt-in system. In order to achieve a world-class city that Indianapolis wants to be in terms of sustainability and the circular economy, we need to make recycling accessible and affordable for all residents.""

IRC is leading the Indianapolis Recycling Initiative to bring business and civic leaders together to develop the best strategy for recycling in the state's largest city. IRC hopes to launch a public campaign by early next year.

Right now, Indianapolis residents must request and pay a separate fee for curbside recycling. All contracts with the city and service providers expire at the end of 2024, allowing a new solid waste plan to be adopted for 2025 and beyond.

Mitchell wants every Indianapolis residence to have trash and recycling containers side-by-side.

“We want to bring some additional educational information along with that so that they know what goes in the trash and what goes in the recycling, so that they have access to that recycling,” said Mitchell. “It’s affordable. It’s accessible. It’s easy and they know how to use it.”

The Indianapolis Recycling Initiative could also include a subscription-based curbside compost program for organic (food/yard) waste.

Mitchell wants to see investments in infrastructure as well that would promote and strengthen the circular economy. She says recycling improvements in recycling in the state’s largest city would have a positive impact on all of Indiana.",United States,2019.06
14,Can New York City solve waste and health problems through a food sustainability initiative?,"
• New York City is one of three ""flagship cities"" participating in the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's three-year food initiative, which launches today in Stockholm. The Big Apple, London and São Paulo are joining with corporate partners, including Danone and Nestlé, to help create a circular economy addressing food industry challenges. The initiative follows the foundation's report, ""Cities and Circular Economy for Food,"" released in January at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
• Challenges addressed by the initiative include climate change, health problems, pollution and biodiversity loss. Ways to address these problems include regenerative farming, more local sourcing, changing the design and marketing of food, and preventing waste by using byproducts, the foundation said in a release. According to the report, 80% of food will be consumed in cities by 2050. Globally, this approach could reduce greenhouse gases equal to 1 billion cars being taken off the road, the foundation estimated.
• ""We feel the need to work hands-on with multiple cities because we know no city is going to face the same situations,"" Emma Chow, initiative project manager, told Food Dive. ""With New York, similar actually to São Paulo, you need to go outside of the city to get to the agricultural areas, but we see great potential for them to leverage manpower to motivate a shift to other systems that are good for ecosystems. We think New York also has great potential for innovation.""

Besides working with the flagship cities, the initiative has partnered with several international companies — food companies such as Danone, Nestlé and Japan's Mizkan; waste companies such as Italy's Veolia; biodegradable plastic companies such as France's Novamont; and fertilizer companies such as Norway's Yara International. The project is funded by Portugal's Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, which focuses on art, social welfare, science and education.

The foundation is betting this global approach can more effectively tackle global challenges posed by issues including food waste, health problems, climate change and pollution. Chow called corporations and funders ""core partners"" providing value through a blend of different types of companies and funding mechanisms. She said they represent different voices across the food value chains and are tasked with putting the foundation's report into action over the next three years.

Action could mean producing more protein that is sustainable — both in where it comes from and how it's produced, Chow said. Key to that goal will be using a circular economy approach, which gradually steps down reliance on consumable resources and transitions to more renewable resource in order to reduce environmental damage. She noted some food brands worldwide have already started using this kind of system.

""The system can be effectively designed, whether it’s by a food brand or a chef in your favorite restaurant. They’re designers and have a say in what proteins are produced,"" Chow said. ""We see that as part of the total that consumers can look at and see implications of their decisions — to produce food that’s healthy but also part of an overall holistically designed system.""

Food companies could benefit by showing consumers and other manufacturers they're walking the talk when it comes to sustainability, reducing waste, and tightening up on production efficiency. It could also mean saving — and even making — money since the way food is produced and distributed is inherently wasteful, Chow said. She called the current system damaging to health and the source of economic losses along the way.

However, with new mechanisms focusing on all areas of the supply chain, changing the system could generate business opportunities and tackle issues such as diversity loss and climate change, she added.

Other projects aimed at this kind of change have focused on specific parts of the food system rather than implementing a system-wide approach, Chow said. This is why the foundation hopes using cities as the starting point will have a lasting impact. Food systems are complex, and it's a challenge to apply effort in all areas, she added.

""Rather than reducing food waste, while that needs to be done, we can’t lose sight of the ultimate goal and ultimate vision. ... How can we reimagine the entire approach based on circular economy thinking?"" Chow said. ""It's not only undoing the damage, but being impactful. We can reenergize the natural system.""

Whether this project can make a tangible difference remains to be seen, but there will likely be progress reports and a wrap-up evaluation in three years. Meanwhile, cities and food companies may make some of these new strategies permanent, altering their practices and carrying forward into the future.

The foundation's report estimated cities could save $700 billion by reducing edible food waste and finding a use for byproducts, so the incentive seems to be there. But this initiative has its sights set on even bigger things.

""Cities can catalyze impacts far beyond their boundaries,"" Chow said. ""The ultimate goal is connecting people with food — a powerful relationship that we run the risk of dissolving over time. We need to make sure we strengthen, rather than erode, the relationship between food and people.""",United States,2019.06
15,X5 And Unilever Agree To Develop Circular Economy,"Published on Jun 12 2019 7:40 AM in Retail tagged: Russia Unilever Sustainability X5 Retail Group

Russia's X5 Retail Group N.V and Unilever have signed an agreement of intent to implement circular economic principles when working together.

The retailer said in a statement that the agreement was signed on the margins of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum by Х5 Retail Group CEO Igor Shekhterman and the Unilever president in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, JV Raman.

The companies agreed to begin a partnership programme of installation of reverse vending machines (RVM).

These are branded kiosks that take used consumer plastic containers for further recycling.

Rewards are given to shoppers that deposit plastic containers to RVMs in Perekrestok and Karusel stores, such as discounts on new purchases.

The retailer said that this creates a closed economic cycle that enables Unilever to act as a responsible producer, selling its products in eco-friendly packaging made from recycled materials.

""In line with sustainable development principles, X5 recycles 100% of the plastic, cardboard, paper and other non-food waste generated by its stores,"" commented Igor Shekhterman, CEO, X5 Retail Group.

""In addition, we seek to support and encourage responsible consumption by our customers by increasing the supply of reusable packaging and by installing RVMs in our stores."" he said.

""Our strategic goal is to complete a global transition to 100% recyclable polymer content in our packaging by 2025."" said JV Raman, president in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, Unilever.

The partners will decide on possible further roll-out based on the outcome of the pilot project.",United States,2019.06
16,Southeast Asia no longer wants the world’s trash,"Southeast Asian nations no longer want your trash. Last week, Malaysia announced it was sending 3,300 tonnes of scrap plastics including CDs, insulated electric cables and milk jugs back to countries ranging from Australia to Bangladesh, Canada, China, Japan and Saudi Arabia. Days later, the Philippines shipped back 69 containers of dirty Canadian diapers and other refuse brought into the country between 2013 and 2014.

It’s easy to see why: Smaller countries don’t want to become dumping grounds for trash that looks like it belongs in a hazardous-waste bin rather than a recycling facility. What’s ironic is that some of the countries forced to take back their scrap plastics don’t necessarily mind. In China, Japan and especially Europe, there’s growing momentum behind the idea that economies should strive to be more “circular” — in other words, that any waste they generate should be processed, recycled and reused at or close to home. Europe has set ambitious targets to achieve a continentwide circular economy over the next three decades.

For the most part, that’s what the world had until quite recently. In the 19th century, an up-and-coming US imported scrap clothing from Europe to feed its paper mills and scrap steel from the UK to help build its railways. After Second World War, Japan and Taiwan rebuilt their economies by importing vast quantities of low-cost scrap metal and paper from around the world.

Beginning in the early 1980s, China surpassed all predecessors by becoming the world’s largest importer of recyclables. Everybody won. Countries that might otherwise have sent recyclables to a dump for lack of proper processing facilities found a huge customer willing to pay a premium for it. Meanwhile, China was able to integrate recyclables into its manufacturing supply chain on a mass scale. To take just one example, in 2016, China made as much as half of its copper from recycled resources, half of which were imported.

Of course, there were costs. Just as Chinese manufacturers often failed to meet the health and safety standards of developed countries, so did Chinese recyclers. Meanwhile, it proved cheaper to import recyclables — even the worst — from the developed world than to collect and manage China’s own waste. In January 2018, China severely restricted the import of scrap recyclables.

That decision has since warped the global recycling trade. Unscrupulous Chinese scrap importers quickly shifted operations to countries such as Malaysia, where they cut corners in recycling materials for export to factories back in China. Recent accounts of so-called “waste dumping” in Malaysia largely document these Chinese operations, not those of traditional Malaysian recyclers, who had previously generated few complaints.

The distinction is important. Restricting the global trade in recyclable plastics because of the actions of some bad actors won’t suddenly encourage rich nations to reuse more of their own trash. The manufacturers who need that recycled material will remain in the developing world, especially since consumption, too, is growing in those regions. Meanwhile, recycled raw materials generated in developed regions like Europe will be more expensive — and less competitive — than what developing countries can make at home (a problem familiar to manufacturers of finished goods).

Rather than trying to create closed recycling loops in each country or each region, environmental activists would do better to make the global recycling trade cleaner and more efficient. The first step is for the World Customs Organisation to establish harmonised custom codes that accurately classify waste and recyclable raw materials. Currently, no such system exists, which allows importers to bring in low-quality recyclables that can only be processed using unsafe and environmentally unsound means.

Meanwhile, if activists in rich countries are concerned with the ability of poorer nations to recycle trash properly, they could do more to help them establish modern waste management systems. The US government is taking small steps in this direction already and China, in particular, could be a leader in this effort. If it diverted a mere 3% of all Belt and Road financing to establishing modern landfills and recycling facilities in recipient countries, it would expand the supply of sustainable raw materials while blunting the negative environmental consequences of letting poorer countries process imported trash.",United States,2019.06
17,The History of Texas’ Startup Ecosystem,"Austin’s status as an entrepreneurial hotbed is undeniable. A 2018 study from the Chamber of Commerce found that startups make up a larger percentage of businesses in Austin than in nearly any other major U.S. metropolitan area.

Although the startup culture that exists in Austin today seems relatively new, its foundation was laid decades ago and has been maintained ever since by the Austin Technology Incubator (ATI). ATI is the deep technology incubator of The University of Texas at Austin that works with university and community entrepreneurs to commercialize breakthrough innovations. It helps entrepreneurs and startups by providing mentors, tools, resources and connections for founders to grow and attain funding. ATI benefits students, faculty members and the state of Texas. It provides an educational experience for both undergraduate and graduate students, a research laboratory for entrepreneurs and tech ventures, and economic stimulation for the Central Texas area and beyond.

Today, ATI is the oldest active technology incubator in the country. Celebrating its 30th anniversary this year, ATI has launched more than 300 graduate companies and has generated more than $3 billion in economic impact in Texas.

“ATI plays a key role in developing meaningful solutions to today’s global challenges,” says Gov. Greg Abbott. “Their contributions have been a catalyst for greater investments and economic development across Central Texas.”

When ATI was founded in 1989, Austin was a very different place. The city was in an economic downturn, and vacant buildings dotted the landscape. But George Kozmetsky, the founder of UT’s economic thinktank the IC² Institute, saw Austin’s potential to become fertile ground to grow a tech-oriented startup community. Kozmetsky connected Austin’s academic, business and community leaders around this goal and launched ATI.",United States,2019.06
18,"Reduce, reuse and recycle: a circular economy approach to plastics","Over 120 representatives from civil society, government, and the private sector convened at the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Consultations with Civil Society to discuss how to address plastic pollution based on a circular economy approach. The event was held on June 10, 2019, preceding the first day of the landmark 56th GEF Council meeting, during which the Council is expected to approve the largest work program in GEF’s history.

The discussion focused on each of the phases of the plastic lifecycle – production, consumption, and waste management – and considered efforts to reduce production, such as bans on plastic bags, mainstreaming of alternative materials and circular designs, efforts to extend the life of products through reuse, resale, repair, rent models, as well as strategies and tactics for successful awareness campaigns.

The session closed with a panel on financing, where options and new initiatives for financing plastic reduction were discussed by representatives from the private sector and multilateral development banks.

At the event, GEF Small Grants Programme, a UNDP-implemented program that works with communities and civil society organizations on the ground, launched its new publication titled “Plastics Management and Circular Economy: Community Solutions.” The publication captures the experiences and lessons learnt from community-based plastics management and promotes the circular economy system at a local and community level. The stories gathered from SGP grantees show that local innovations can play an essential role in plastic management.

Although plastics have become an integral part of our daily lives, the linear model of “take, make, use, and dispose” with regard to plastic materials poses a grave threat to the sustainability of our economy and environment. Most plastic packaging and goods are used only once and then discarded. Between 1950 and 2015, only 10 percent of the plastic waste generated was recycled, dramatically increasing the quantity of waste in the natural environment for 500-1000 years afterwards.

The GEF Small Grants Programme provides technical and financial support to projects led by civil society organizations and communities in order to test innovative practices for plastic waste management using a circular economy approach. This approach promotes closed-loop production and consumption through “reducing, reusing, and recycling” plastics through material engineering and product design, shifting consumer use and behavior, and developing sound approaches to waste collection and management.

“The threats posed by plastic pollution can only be defeated by the collective efforts of all sectors of society,” said Francoise Clottes, Director of Strategy and Operations of the GEF, during the launch of the new publication. “We hope that this publication will be useful not only to other communities and CSOs around the world that may want to replicate these model projects, but also to governments, the private sector and other stakeholders.”

Examples of innovative practices emerging from the SGP portfolio include the efforts of a women’s association in Burundi, which undertook reforestation by packaging seedlings with ecological alternatives to plastics. The project replaced plastic bags with bags made from banana bark. This practice avoided the use of 3 million plastic bags throughout Burundi and was replicated in many other communities.

Furthermore, around 300,000 seedlings were planted in the national park, reforesting 13,000 hectares. An additional 150,000 seedlings were planted in the project beneficiaries’ farmlands. The sales of bark bags along with cereal and cassava grindings increased the livelihoods of the households to $55 per year, allowing families to pay for school and hospital fees and improving the overall quality of life in the community.

Similarly, nearly 700 rag pickers in India, many of whom are socially marginalized and illiterate women, have been trained in waste collection and recycling activities. Through these efforts, women collect approximately 10 tonnes of plastic waste a day at five recovery centres in Bhopal. Around 45 tonnes of plastic waste are sold to cement industries in and around Bhopal to be used as fuel in the furnaces. Around 60 tonnes of plastic waste are sold to Madhya Pradesh Rural Road Development Authority every month to be used in road construction. These roads, made with mixed plastic, last longer due to their high resistance to water, which is important for a region with a significant monsoon period.

With the project, women now earn around $3 – $11 every day from selling the plastic waste. Over 850 rag pickers have been enrolled in health insurance schemes and provided with municipal identity cards and uniforms. The success of this project has also led to the establishment of a pilot plastic recovery center in Indore. As a result, around 3,500 rag pickers have been organized into self-help groups in the city.

The Government of Madhya Pradesh consequently released a policy on plastics in which they described the “Bhopal Model” and specified the Sarthak Karmis (women rag pickers) as an integral part of the collection centres, thus organizing them as an entity within the policy. Sarthak Karmis have also been included as the NGO representative to the High-Level Committee to share their best practices.",United States,2019.06
20,Plastics and Circular Economy: Community Solutions,"This publication captures the GEF Small Grant Programme's (SGP) experiences and lessons learned on plastics management, spanning not only the area of chemical and waste management, but also international waters and biodiversity conservation. The projects focus on implementing a circular economy either through recycling, reducing and reusing plastics for new products, influencing consumer use and behavior, or developing better waste collection and management practices at the community level. Some of these initiatives have also been scaled up in partnership with government and private sector. The 10 cases included in this publication show that local communities and grassroots solutions are already contributing to the implementation of the circular economy concept by providing circular solutions to plastic waste problems through community-based actions to “reduce, reuse and recycle” plastics, known as “3Rs” ranking by the priority of actions.",United States,2019.06
22,Promotes Cradle to Cradle Design™ for the Circular Economy to Sustainable Brands,"MBDC recently returned from Sustainable Brands ‘19 in Detroit, which took place last week. The annual conference brought together business leaders focused on chemistry, circular economy, energy, finance and communications/marketing with the mission of obtaining The Good Life. The Good Life directly corresponds with MBDC co-founder William McDonough’s Five Goods: Good Materials, Good Economy, Good Energy, Good Water and Good Lives which aim to create not only less bad but also more good.

Kicking off the conference on Tuesday, McDonough presented a bold new vision for the collection, processing, circularity and productivity of plastic. McDonough’s outline for a circular plastics system is based on the fundamental guidelines of Cradle to Cradle Design™ for the Circular Economy to create a world beyond the concept of waste. McDonough directed the audience to “refuse refuse,” or, in other words, reject plastics and packaging that are not reusable, compostable, recyclable or recoverable.

Cradle to Cradle Design was also center stage as MBDC announced a collaboration with Toxnot, an industry-leading technology company which provides an efficient system for manufacturers to gather supply chain data, gain insight into their hazard profiles, report on the results and create safer products. Joint efforts between MBDC and Toxnot seek to increase traction for safer, healthier products across global supply chains through Cradle to Cradle Certification™.

“Disclosure of ingredients for products and materials does not always equate to reduced harm for human and environmental health,” said Jay Bolus, President of MBDC. “Our collaboration with Toxnot will provide manufacturers a trusted way to communicate their work toward safer and healthier materials, because the ingredients will have been fully assessed for Cradle to Cradle Certification – while keeping their proprietary formulas secured. This is optimized disclosure for consumers and industry alike to truly further transparency for material chemistry.”

The MBDC team – along with colleagues from sister companies, McDonough Innovation and William McDonough + Partners – welcomed clients, friends and curious minds throughout the week at our booth in the Innovation Expo hall. The booth featured a selection of Cradle to Cradle Certified™ products including Shaw carpet tile, C&A T-shirts and jeans and Henry Rose fine fragrances.

32,LG Chem Teams up with Envirostream for Innovative Battery Recycling Solutions in Australia,"- LG Chem partners with Envirostream to develop safe and innovative recycling solutions to reduce battery waste stream

- 95% of the resources recovered from end-of-life batteries are converted into raw materials for new batteries resulting in a circular economy

SEOUL, South Korea, June 11, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- LG Chem, South Korea's leading manufacturer of advanced lithium-ion batteries, formed a partnership with one of the pioneering recycle-luminaries Envirostream to be LG Chem's exclusive battery recycling partner in Australia. This valuable partnership aims to develop safe and innovative management solutions to increase Australia's low recovery rates concerning batteries, which is an increasing threat to the Australian environment.

LG Chem and Envirostream's forward-thinking approaches are expected to elevate battery recycling systems in Australia to a whole new level. Originally, used batteries were sent overseas for recycling or left in landfills. However, with Envirostream's ISO 14001 accredited modular, 95% of the resources from end-of-life batteries can be safely recovered before being sent to metal and battery manufacturers to be converted into raw materials for new battery production. This initiative is the first step to allow LG Chem to be closer to achieving its environmental mission as well as bringing a truly circular economy to its Australian operations.

Established in 2017, Envirostream is a new ambitious company specifically designed to develop safe and innovative, on-shore processing solutions for rapidly growing issues in the battery waste stream. Recognized as the first company in Australia to recycle lithium batteries, Envirostream recycled 298,240 kilograms of them in 2018 and showed how previously unseen opportunities can be developed and nurtured in Australia's recovery sector.

Batteries have presented some of the biggest emerging challenges to Australia's waste stream. According to research conducted by CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation), only 2 percent of Australia's annual 3,300 tons of lithium-ion battery waste is recycled, with waste predicted to grow by at least 300% each year by 2036.

""We're extremely proud to be able to carve a new path towards preserving our precious planet through this invaluable partnership with Envirostream"", said Jamie Allen, General Manager from LG Chem Australia, ""Starting with Australia, we hope this provides the opportunity to expand sustainable options for lithium-ion battery disposal.""

41,Brückner's Baumeister sees a clear role for film packaging in sustainability,"At October's K 2019 trade show, the German mechanical engineering association VDMA will focus on sustainability and the circular economy and the parts its members, the makers of plastics and rubber machinery, will play in that future.

Michael Baumeister, managing director technology and logistics of plastic packaging machinery supplier Brückner Maschinenbau said in a Q&A that the packaging industry and new technologies will play a crucial role in achieving sustainability and circular economy.



 Plastic packaging, he said, should be used “where it is of direct benefit, relying on easily recyclable film mono-structures.”



 With more than 230 members from Germany, Austria, Switzerland and France, VDMA will center its focus on circular economy and closed loop concepts during K 2019, to be held in Düsseldorf, Germany, Oct. 16-23.

Q: How can a company such as Brückner Maschinenbau contribute to circular economy?

Baumeister: We are intensively looking for ways to improve recyclability of plastics products. For example, we address the question of how to produce packages by using easily recyclable mono-structures on the basis of polyolefin that have the properties achieved today with compounds of nylon, polyester or metallized film which are all difficult to recycle. We practically apply a preliminary stage of circular economy that makes recycling possible for many products in the first place.

Q: Material compounds are often used to make foods more durable. Is this necessary to the degree presently applied?

Baumeister: Packaging films are becoming ever thinner while they retain their protecting function, thus saving more and more raw materials. There are high-tech lightweight products which protect the valuable commodity of food for as long as possible. It is particularly worthy of protection as the production of foodstuffs also uses many scarce resources, such as great amounts of water and energy. Not least because of this, it is necessary to drastically reduce spoilage of food. Packaging and cooling are decisive factors.

Compared with the much higher good food the CO2 footprint of packaging is negligible. When it comes to cars or planes consumers welcome lightweight construction parts because they reduce fuel consumption. When looking at packaging, consumers usually do not see this benefit. On the other hand, it will have to be verified if consumers accept packages which are not as smooth and transparent as they are now. At present, the appearance of packages has a strong influence on the buying decision.



Q: The EU is forcing circular economy for plastics. The first bans and regulations are in place. How do you feel about this?

Baumeister: It is important that these regulations apply in the same way to everyone operating in the European market. Otherwise competition would be disrupted. With equal conditions for everyone, nobody would have a commercial disadvantage. As positive result of regulation I would expect essentially more intensive research on recycling possibilities, for example, on chemical recycling. As a consequence, there would be much more serious attempts to produce better recyclates. Because we do not want to down-cycle, that means to manufacture products of lower and lower quality – ranging from film via park benches to briquettes for fuel.

The issue is about manufacturing high-quality products from recyclates, such as film which can come into contact with food again. This is extremely difficult to achieve with mechanical recycling due to hygiene requirements. Political specifications necessitate more complex processes for sustaining raw materials, a fact that constitutes the same obstacle for everyone.

Q: Why should film be recycled into film at all? The recycling effort is immense. You need a lot of energy. Wouldn't it be better to make injection-molded parts from film waste?

Baumeister: From a short-term view, it is presently the cheapest option to turn a high-quality foil into something simple after usage, or to burn it instead of heating oil. In the long term, humankind must manage to become independent of crude oil because its resources are limited. At some point we will have to be able to cover our energy demand completely from renewables. Then energy will no longer be the bottleneck and then it will be very sensible to use energy to obtain raw materials for further utilization. By applying energetically complex procedures such as chemical recycling, single-origin plastics could then be provided for high-grade applications. This way you could preserve valuable raw materials. This is the heart of the recycling economy concept: That no material will be lost.

Q: The layers of plastics in the oceans mainly consist of packaging material. Do we have too much of it?

Baumeister: Meanwhile more than half of the population already live in cities. They have to be fed. That's not possible without hygienic packaging. The main function of packaging is to protect higher-value commodities. But it is also obvious that there is some packaging that is not necessary.

The plastics industry has realized that packaging waste is a major problem. The Ceflex consortium of companies is already working hard on this problem. Over 100 firms are currently participating, from raw material providers via machinery manufacturers to those who use films to make the packaging. We actively commit ourselves in three to seven working groups dealing with the design of packaging, the required machine technology and communication with the public.

Wouldn't a working circular economy be the end of organic plastics? We wouldn't really need them.

Baumeister: [Poly lactic acid] has been in the market for several years. We have developed adequate machine technology and our machines can process the material. But this material is based on corn starch and is still very expensive. On taking a closer look, the obvious advantages – PLA is not based on crude oil, it is made from a renewable resource and is compostable – are no advantage. The Grüner Punkt (green dot) initiative does not classify PLA as recyclable because there are no closed cycles. It cannot be disposed of in the refuse bin because you can't tell it from ordinary plastic film. They cannot be recycled together with other film materials.

With regard to its properties, PLA has no comparable barrier or protection function; that's why it does not replace conventional film. We rather see that polyester of other polyethylene types can be made from renewable raw materials or are added to crude-oil based raw materials, the so-called drop-in, i.e. not really crude-oil based, but no longer compostable. As additive, in the same way as E-10, bio-ethanol is added to petrol. In my view circular economy is not the end of bioplastics, but they will not play an essential role in the foreseeable future.",United States,2019.06
42,"A conversation with Google's circularity maven, CSO Kate Brandt | Greenbiz","This article is adapted from the newsletter Circular Weekly. Subscribe here.

Every emerging industry needs champions. In recent months, I’ve been conducting a series of interviews with circular economy leaders — advisers to our Circularity 19 conference — who are driving the transition from linear to circular.

I recently caught up with Kate Brandt, Google’s chief sustainability officer and textbook badass. With an impressive resume that includes senior roles at the Department of Energy, White House Office of Presidential Personnel and the Navy — plus President Barack Obama’s appointment as the country’s first chief sustainability officer — Brandt now leads sustainability across Google’s worldwide operations, products and supply chain. I know, total badass. The conversation has been edited for clarity and length.

Lauren Phipps: What are you excited about right now?

Kate Brandt: As we think about moving from a conceptual circular economy to implementation, I’m really digging into the idea of how technology — particularly AI and machine learning — enable some of these new business models. Whether that's helping to better set prices in online marketplaces the way that Stuffstr started using machine learning, or looking at how do we develop the best, most durable and healthy materials, like we've seen the European Space Agency doing in applying artificial intelligence, I'm really excited about this topic right now.

Phipps: How are you applying these technologies at Google?

Brandt: We've been applying machine learning in several ways in our operations. We've been designing out energy waste in our data centers by applying a machine algorithm to our cooling system and seeing a 30-percent increase in efficiency. And of course, that also translates into financial savings because energy is a huge cost input to our operations.

Equally, we have been interested in the opportunity to bring technology into our kitchens to reduce the food waste we're generating. This work has really started with bringing Leanpath — a great company up in Oregon — into our kitchens. That system includes a camera and a scale, so we have a data set that we've developed over many years that's enabled us to save over 4 million pounds of food waste. [Leanpath’s automated tools measure and track pre-consumer food waste in commercial kitchens. The platform analyzes the source and quantity of wasted food, and offers actionable feedback to increase efficiency, cut costs and train foodservice operators to prevent edible food from being wasted.]

Phipps: What are the biggest barriers you’ve seen in the transition to more circular systems?

Brandt: Right now, we’re at this place where we’re moving the circular economy from conceptually a systems approach that makes a great deal of sense, to actually putting it into practice. I feel like we've started to make that transition in a fairly short period of time.

But once we start implementing, that's where we run into the fun and beautiful challenges. I think we are continuing to get better at understanding how we apply some of these tools. Along the way, what we've begun to learn is that AI and machine learning really are incredible tools, but they have to be applied in the right ways. They’re not going to solve every challenge.

They’re best suited to solve challenges where you have a data set with very strong fidelity in that data. What we like to say is that it's essentially garbage in, garbage out. If you don't have good data, the AI machine and learning is not going to help you make better decisions.

Phipps: What's keeping you up at night?

Brandt: One thing that's been keeping me up at night is single-use plastics. We were recently supporters of a great study that Closed Loop Partners put out around keeping plastics in play, looking at the topic of chemical recycling and what different technology pathways are available for this huge glut of single-use plastic that now exists.

There was a core, seminal Ellen MacArthur Foundation study on the potential to have more plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050. But I've been incredibly heartened by this recent piece of work by Closed Loop Partners. It's starting to show that there's a lot of opportunity and a lot of potential for innovation here.",United States,2019.06

44,Canada to ban single-use plastics by 2021,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced that his government will ban single-use plastics in Canada under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA) as early as 2021. The ban would include items such as bags, straws and cutlery.

According to a report from the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (CBC News), Ottawa, Canada, a full list of banned items isn’t set in stone, but a source told the news organization that banned items could include items like cotton swabs, drink stirrers, plates and balloon sticks. Fast-food containers and cups made of expanded polystyrene (EPS) also will be banned. Trudeau says the government will research which items it should ban and the nation will likely follow the model chosen by the European Union.

The Canadian Plastics Industry Association (CPIA) and the Chemistry Industry Association of Canada (CIAC) report that they also fully endorse the objective of stopping waste, including plastic waste, from leaking into the environment. According to a joint news release from the two associations, the groups “welcome the plans for producer-led extended producer responsibility (EPR) initiatives which will lead to more harmonized collection and help build markets for recycled plastics.”

However, the two associations report that they want to “caution government not to predetermine the outcome and consider impacts throughout the lifecycle of plastic products and their alternatives. Any rush to judgment could have serious implications on industry’s ability to create a circular economy for plastics that supports a zero plastic waste strategy.” According to CPIA and CIAC, members of the two associations believe that creating an impression that safe, sanitary plastic materials are “toxic” through the CEPA legislation will make it difficult for Canada to achieve its zero-waste objectives.

The two associations report that they want to work with the federal government to support its science-based approach to finding a solution to eliminate plastic waste.

“Plastics are key to our modern and sustainable way of life, but they do not belong in the environment,” says Carol Hochu, president and CEO of CPIA. “We understand the urgency of the problem and are committed to being part of the solution.”

“CPIA and CIAC believe in the development of a circular economy for plastics as a resource to be kept in the economy and not leaked into the environment,” says Bob Masterson, president and CEO of CIAC. “Consumer education is important as we need a whole of society approach to the issue. Industry, governments, civil society and consumers must work together to solve this global issue.”",United States,2019.06
45,Canada wants to ban single-use plastics. Here’s how that works in Europe,"The Canadian government is eyeing a new ban on single-use plastics, meaning some disposable takeaway bins and plastic cutlery could be on their way out.

In an announcement on Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the government will look at the policies implemented earlier this year by the European Union as a model for coming up with its own list of single-use plastics to ban.

READ MORE: Trudeau eyeing a Canadian ban on single-use plastics by 2021

The European Parliament voted earlier this year to ban the 10 most common forms of plastic pollution on Europe’s beaches, with further measures aiming to reduce the use of a broader range of plastic items in the future.

That vote earned overwhelming support from the members of European Parliament, with 560 voting in favour and just 35 voting against.

Since that policy will guide the creation of a Canadian ban, here’s a look at exactly how it works.

What does it actually ban?

As noted above, the goal of the ban was to get rid of the most common forms of plastic pollution on European beaches.

The European Parliament proposed last year to eliminate those forms of plastic and, in March 2019, voted in favour of a ban that must now be passed in each of the legislatures of its member states before it can take effect for the target of 2021.

Under the implementation of the ban, the following list of single-use plastic items will no longer be available in European Union member states:

According to a European Commission press release about the ban, those 10 commonly used items make up roughly 70 per cent of marine litter.

That ban does not extend to plastic bags.

Plastic bags were the subject of a 2015 European directive that required member states to introduce legislation limiting their use.

What else is being done?

Because the ban targets only a limited number of items, the policy also imposes a requirement for member states to take actions to reduce the use of some other forms of single-use plastics not included in the prohibition.

Member states must introduce their own measures to reduce the use of plastic food and beverage containers.

They also must put more stringent labelling requirements in place on certain products such as wet wipes, sanitary towels and tobacco filters.

Those labels will need to state if the item contains plastic and the environmental damage of not disposing properly of the product.

The policy also sets new benchmarks that European member states will need to hit when it comes to the content of the plastic they are producing, stating that by 2025, at least 25 per cent of plastic bottles will need to be made with recycled material.

That number would increase to 90 per cent by 2029.

Bottle caps will also be required to be attached to their bottles so that they do not get lost and left out of the recycling process.

Member states will need to collect 90 per cent of the plastic bottles they use by 2029, and the rules will also require plastic producers to shoulder a greater portion of the cost of cleaning up litter.

Why is this being done now?

There are several factors at play in why such bans are happening now, ranging from growing consumer awareness to increased voter concern about climate change and pollution. Those voters are also electing governments tasked with a mandate to fix the problem.

This change in consumer and political behaviour goes hand in hand with a shift towards what economists call the “circular economy.”

READ MORE: The average kid will get 20 months less to live thanks to toxic air, says study

The European Union referenced the shift in its rationale for the bans, and Trudeau did the same on Monday.

“What this will lead to is businesses will understand if they are also responsible for the recycling of the plastics they are putting in their products. They will think about the circular economy, they will think about the choices they make,” he said when asked about why he is pursuing the ban.

So what is a circular economy?

According to the World Economic Forum, the phrase encompasses a global economic shift away from what is known as the linear economy, which revolved around a model of make-use-dispose — with the latter part of that cycle leading to pollution.

WATCH: Accessing fashion fast is getting easier, but it may be having a negative impact on the environment

A circular economy is one where that linear cycle ends in a loop rather than a dump of the product, with the ultimate goal of designing products so that waste can be eliminated as items at the end of their life cycle can be re-used in the creation of more products.

“These are designed from the start for reuse, and products subject to rapid technological advance are designed for upgrade,” reads an explanation of the circular economy concept published by the World Economic Forum.

It’s effectively a much bigger version of the reduce-reuse-recycle mantra, except on a global and industrial scale.

And it’s closer to becoming a reality than some might think.

In 2015, the European Commission laid out a plan and a package of measures to move Europe towards a more circular economy and, in March 2019, received a final report indicating that all 54 of those measures had been implemented.

Reducing plastic pollution was part of that, along with pledges to toughen up design standards so that more products can be reused rather than disposed of and commitments to work to boost the market for reused water to tackle water scarcity.

Finland also created its own national action plan in 2016, while China and the European Union agreed in a memorandum of understanding last year to jointly work towards a circular economy.

The question that remains is whether Canada will follow suit.",Canada,2019.06
46,A breaking point: Ottawa announces plan to ban single-use plastics,"MONT-SAINT-HILAIRE, Que. (NEWS 1130) – Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the federal government plans to implement a complete ban on single-use plastics as early as 2021.

While the details around how a ban will be implemented are still unclear, Trudeau says Canada’s policy will be grounded in scientific evidence, and will draw inspiration from the European Union’s model.

Less than 10 per cent of plastic used in Canada gets recycled, and without any change in habits, Canadians will be throwing out $11 billion worth of plastic products by 2030.

The products could include single-use items like drinking straws, water bottles, plastic bags, cutlery, stir sticks and fast food containers. However, an official list has not yet been released.

The federal government will be conducting research to determine the best course of action.

Trudeau says the situation of plastic overflowing in landfills and polluting oceans and waterways has reached a breaking point, and action is needed.

Courtney-Alberni MP Gord Johns, the New Democrat who first tabled the legislation in 2017, says he’s worried the government won’t act quickly enough to deliver on this promise.

“Move forward with a really stringent and strong plan,” Johns advises. “We want to learn more about the details and how they’re going to address the other important areas. The government has assured us that they’re going to follow through with delivering on the strategy that was passed unanimously, but we haven’t seen that yet.”

The NDP’s critic for Fisheries, Oceans and Coast Guard adds today’s announcement doesn’t contain specifics about packaging issues and the industrial use of plastics.

The announcement is receiving some praise from experts. Tony Walker, an assistant professor with the School for Resource and Environmental Studies at Dalhousie University, says he’s pleased the government is planning to take action, and says the policy is “incredibly urgent.”

“I’m really pleased that the government is taking action, but the government has been talking about it for some time,” he says. “I think they’ve been taking consultation with industry, as well as academics and policy makers.”

While he notes the announcement is timely, Walker says other countries around the world have already made this move.

While Trudeau commends a number of Canadian municipalities which have already banned single-use plastics in their jurisdictions, he adds a country-wide ban is necessary.

Walker says a federal ban will mean a “level playing field” is created for all communities across Canada.

“They can standardize what materials are going to be banned, and those which stay,” Walker explains. “And those which stay, presumably, manufacturers will have the responsibility over, or they can, at least, be recycled in all municipalities across Canada.

According to the federal government, Canadians throw away $8-billion in plastic waste each year. Trudeau says a new plastic waste reduction legislation will boost the economy and create jobs in innovation.

The federal government is expected to work with provinces, territories, and industry stakeholders to “develop consistent standards for extended producer responsibility programs” across the country.

That means companies that make plastic products or sell items with plastic packaging will be responsible for collecting and recycling these items.

Walker believes this extended responsibility on businesses could see municipalities boost their recycling capacity.

“Instead of, in the past, shipping it overseas to third world or developing countries, we can now take care of any materials we do not ban and we keep in the system,” he explains. “We can recycle, here, domestically in Canada.”

He says the sheer volume and complexity of the plastics municipalities have been receiving has been an issue when it comes to recycling domestically. By producing the plastics here, Walker believes Canada has a responsibility to keep the waste and recycle it. “Essentially, closing the loop and having a circular economy — but keeping the resources in Canada.”

47,ASEAN leaders to vow at summit to tackle marine debris,"Southeast Asian leaders will commit to tackle the growing problem of marine debris, in particular plastics, during their summit later this month, according to a draft declaration obtained Monday.

The leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations will make the vow in the Bangkok Declaration on Combating Marine Debris in ASEAN Region, to be inked during their summit to be held on June 23 in Bangkok.

In the draft, the leaders call for strengthening actions at the national level, as well as through international collaboration, to prevent and significantly reduce marine debris.

They pledge to enhance policy dialogue and information sharing, implement partnerships between the public and private sectors, and promote innovative solutions to reducing plastic litter, including through development of a circular economy whereby plastics are kept out of the environment and instead returned to production through reuse and recycling.

The leaders also commit to devote more scientific and research work to combatting marine debris and to increase public awareness and participation through advocacy and education, with the aim of changing people's behavior.

The draft shows ASEAN's concern over the ""high and rapidly increasing levels"" of marine plastic litter and other debris, and the adverse impacts on marine biodiversity, ecosystems, animal well-being, fisheries, maritime transport, recreation, tourism, local societies and economies.

It cites an ""urgent need"" for strengthened knowledge of the levels and effects of microplastics and nanoplastics on the marine ecosystem, food safety and human health.",United States,2019.06
48,Canada may ban single-use plastics by 2021,"Canada celebrated Environment Week from June 3 to 7, an annual event established in 1971 to celebrate the country’s environmental accomplishments and encourage citizens to preserve and protect their natural resources. However, the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is in no mood to rest on Canada’s eco laurels: The Globe and Mail newspaper reports that public officials “will begin a scientific evaluation to designate plastic waste as a toxic substance under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA), the first step to imposing bans on disposable single-use items and introducing national recycling standards and targets.”

The initiative is intended to eliminate single-use plastic products and packaging because, said the Globe and Mail, household recycling is not keeping pace with the proliferation of these items. Only 9 percent of plastics are recycled in Canada, according to the national newspaper. China’s restriction on imports of plastic waste for recycling has exacerbated the problem in Canadian cities and provinces.

Adding plastic waste to the list of toxic substances under the CEPA is justified, Elaine MacDonald of the environmental advocacy group Ecojustice told the Globe and Mail. “It’s a definition under the act and it really is about, [the questions]: ‘Is this substance harming the environment or harming human health?’” she said. “We’re seeing there’s plenty of evidence out there, based on what other countries have done already, based on scientific analysis and studies that have been done.""

The ban would follow the EU model, a government source told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), and affect the usual suspects: Plastic straws, coffee cups and fast food containers made of expanded polystyrene, and the like. It may also curtail the use of oxo-degradable plastics, which include additives that don’t completely biodegrade. The ban could take effect as early as 2021, according to the CBC, and is part of a larger strategy to tackle plastic pollution that the government is expected to outline today.

Responding to the news report, the Canadian Plastics Industry Association (CPIA) and Chemistry Industry Association of Canada (CIAC) issued a statement today noting that they ""fully endorse the objective of stopping waste, including plastic waste, from leaking into the environment,"" but cautioned against creating an impression that ""safe, sanitary plastic materials are toxic through the CEPA."" That will make it more difficult for Canada to achieve its zero waste objectives, they said.

Stressing their support of a circular economy for plastics, and noting that several association members are part of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste and have committed substantial resources to that initiative, the CPIA and CIAC urge the government ""not to pre-determine the outcome and consider impacts throughout the lifecycle of plastic products and their alternatives. Any rush to judgment could have serious implications on industry’s ability to create a circular economy for plastics that supports a national zero plastic waste strategy,"" they added.",United States,2019.06
49,The circular economy: tackling plastic pollution,"Over the last two years pollution by plastics has caught the attention, and sparked the concern, of the world. What was for long seen as a marginal, local, and largely aesthetic issue – even by some environmentalists – is now established to be one of our greatest challenges.

It is increasingly recognised as one of the prime symbols of the world's throwaway 'linear' economy and of the need to replace it with a regenerative 'circular' one, through systems – rather than piecemeal - change.

Naoko Ishii, CEO and Chairperson of the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) has hailed the new awareness of plastic pollution as a sign that the time has come for the circular economy, which, she called in a speech last year, “nothing less than a blueprint for a fundamental transformation of our economic system – a transformation that is urgently needed, entirely possible, and indeed desirable.”

Certainly, plastics illustrate the urgency of the need. Their production grew more than twenty times over between 1964 and 2015 and is expected to double again by 2035 and almost quadruple by 2050.

About 330 billion single use plastic bags are produced each year and tend to be used for just a few hours before being thrown away. In all, some 4,900 million tonnes of plastics - over three quarters of the total amount ever produced has been discarded into landfills or the rest of the environment - and this is expected to grow to 12,000 million tonnes by 2050 unless action is taken. Some kinds take over 500 years to break down.

Every minute of every day the equivalent of the contents of a garbage truck full of plastic reaches the oceans; by 2050 this is expected to grow to four per minute. By then, it is predicted that there will be more plastic, by weight, than fish in the seas. Indeed, it is already found everywhere, even in Arctic sea ice and the world's deepest ocean trench.

Discarded synthetic fishing nets entangle marine mammals and other sea life. At the other end of the scale, tiny pieces, or microplastics – which often accumulate toxic chemicals – end up in the food chain, eventually reaching people.

Microplastics are also emerging as a threat to soils and drinking water, raising further health concerns. And producing, and burning, plastics contributes to climate change. In all, Trucost and the American Chemistry Council have estimated, the environmental cost of plastics could reach $139 billion a year.

Traditionally plastic pollution has been tackled after it has happened, through clean-up efforts, but the only solution lies in addressing its root causes. These lie in the dominant “take, make, waste” linear economy, fuelled by large amounts of cheap, accessible energy and other resources, and producing things designed to be disposable.

The circular economy, by contrast, aims to use resources for as long as possible, extracting as much value from them as is practicable - and then, when they do reach the end of their lives to recover and regenerate products and materials. It aims to design out waste and hazardous materials in favour of such restoration and regeneration.

The World Economic Forum has reported that implementing the circular economy worldwide could yield material cost savings of up to $1 trillion a year by 2025. The World Business Council for Sustainable Development has estimated that it could unlock business opportunities worth $4.5 trillion.

A circular economy would both maximise the benefits of plastics and minimise their ill effects, through such measures as producing them from plants rather than fossil fuels; redesigning products to cut waste and make them last; encouraging recycling and reuse; and using plastic wastes as a resource. Such measures also need to be accompanied by reducing demand for plastic products and discouraging non-essential ones.

Significant progress has been made in this regard in the past months. Governments in May 2019 amended the Basel Convention, which is a legally-binding treaty to control the movement of hazardous waste, to include plastic waste in a legally-binding framework. This will make global trade in plastic waste more transparent and better regulated, whilst also ensuring that its management is safer for human health and the environment.

At the same time, a new Partnership on Plastic Waste was established to mobilise business, government, academic and civil society resources, interests and expertise to assist in implementing the new measures, to provide a set of practical supports – including tools, best practices, technical and financial assistance - for this ground-breaking agreement. This significant step taken by 187 Governments will strengthen the work already being done by some governments, in both developed and developing countries, who for example have banned single-use plastic bags. Some companies are introducing re-useable, recycling or compostable packaging. The recent adoption of the plastic decisions under the Basel Convention and the establishment of the Plastic Waste Partnership pave the way for a more systematic approach that integrates both clean-up and preventative measures in view of moving towards a system where, in the medium to long term, plastics never become waste.

The GEF is well placed to help make this happen since it regularly engages with governments and companies worldwide. Over recent years it has been switching the focus of its operations to address the underlying drivers of environmental degradation – rather than merely its effects – and it is now concentrating GEF-7 - its latest, recently approved, four-year investment cycle - on catalysing systemic, transformational change.

The GEF-7 strategy includes marine plastics, and a special session on plastics and the circular economy is taking place with civil society organisations from around the world on June 10 during the 56th GEF Council in Washington DC. A new GEF film screened at the event shows how businesses, governments and civil society organisations are making commitments to tackle marine plastics.

The GEF has started to address plastic pollution through a circular economy approach, and is working at the global, regional and national level through public-private partnerships.

The Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE), launched by the World Economic Forum and co-chaired by the GEF and Royal Philips, focuses on a broad range of industries like consumer electronics to deal with e-waste, bringing together both regulators and industry.

PACE launched the Global Plastic Action Partnership to bring countries and industry players together around efforts to tackle marine plastic pollution. For example, in Southeast Asia, GEF has initiated investments to develop national and municipal action plans on plastics. Indonesia - the world's second biggest producer of mismanaged plastic waste after China – has announced a national plan on marine litter and aims to reduce it by 70 per cent by 2025.

Building on its experiences, the GEF plans to step up its investments in circular economy initiatives in the coming years. It will continue to implement the best ways of managing waste to stem the deluge of plastic waste in the short term, while creating the enabling environment for the systemic change that is so urgently needed.",United States,2019.06

53,The backlash to plastic has oil companies worried,"As the world strives to wean itself off fossil fuels, oil companies have been turning to plastic as the key to their future. Now even that's looking overly optimistic.

The global crackdown on plastic trash threatens to take a big chunk out of demand growth just as oil companies like Saudi Aramco sink billions into plastic and chemicals assets. Royal Dutch Shell Plc, BP Plc, Total SA and Exxon Mobil Corp. are all ramping up investments in the sector.

Renewed emphasis on recycling and the spread of local bans on some kinds of plastic products could cut petrochemical demand growth to one-third of its historical pace, to about 1.5 percent a year, said Paul Bjacek, a principal director at consulting firm Accenture Plc.

""Oil companies are saying, no problem, we'll invest in petrochemicals,"" Bjacek said. ""But petrochemicals, after the circular economy happens to the maximum extent, is likely to be a low-growth market.""

Demand for gasoline is flatlining as electric vehicle sales surge and conventional cars become more efficient. But oil is essential for much more than just transportation: It's broken down into chemicals and plastics used in every aspect of modern life. Growth in demand for chemicals already outstrips the need for liquid fuels, and that gap will widen in coming decades, according to the International Energy Agency.

Crude drillers and refiners see that as their safe haven against the fading outlook for fuel, ensuring that they'll have a piece of a more robust market for their hydrocarbons. The shift is most apparent at Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest oil company, which in March agreed to pay $69.1 billion for a majority stake in Saudi Arabia chemical producer Sabic while investing billions more to expand chemical production around the world.

New oil refineries are being designed to produce less fuel and more chemicals. China is leading the way, with more than $100 billion invested in crude-to-chemicals projects over the next five years, according to Citigroup Inc. analysts led by Horace Chan.

Projects by companies including Hengli Petrochemical Co. and Rongsheng Petrochemical Co. will devote as much as half their capacity to chemicals, mostly paraxylene, a material that China imports to make polyester and plastic bottles. That's a sharp increase from the 10 percent chemical production at a typical refinery and as much as 20 percent at modern refineries integrated with chemical plants.

""They're building these units because they need the fuel, but they are sort of future proofing it,"" said John Roberts, an analyst at UBS Securities. ""It's acknowledgment that there is a peak coming in the global fuels market.""

Saudi Aramco, with Chevron Lummus Global and CB&I, is planning a refinery with 70-80 percent of its output in chemicals. That could double the profitability from a barrel of oil, IHS Markit estimates. It's building another refinery in Saudi Arabia with 40 percent of its production dedicated to chemicals, as well as adding chemical capacity to another Texas plant.

Exxon plans to expand its Asian and North American chemical-making capacity by 40 percent in anticipation of rising demand.

But consultants and analysts are sounding the alarm that petrochemical demand is heading south of earlier forecasts. Images of waste fouling the oceans are drawing government bans on single-use plastics from the European Union to India and California. Chemical makers are investing in recycling technologies and infrastructure. Coca Cola Co. is pledging to recycle one bottle for every one it sells by 2030 as consumer products companies come under pressure to reduce their use of plastics.

With more investment in waste recovery, recycled resins could replace almost a third of virgin plastic by 2030 and nearly 60 percent by 2050, slashing demand for petrochemicals, according to a McKinsey & Co. report. Christof Ruehl, the former head of research for the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, estimates a 20 percent cut in oil demand from petrochemicals if current trends continue.

Sharply higher recycling rates could cut plastics growth in half, said Robin A. Waters, IHS director of plastics planning and analysis. That's a worst-case scenario, but it shows the potential disruption to the industry, where plastics already account for half of demand, he said.

""It adds some uncertainty from a demand standpoint as the oil industry is looking more and more to chemicals for diversification,"" Waters said.",United States,2019.06
55,Businesses help save the environment | Atty. Jose Ferdinand M. Rojas II,"The world celebrated World Environment Day on June 5, encouraging global awareness and action toward decreasing air pollution, which is this year’s theme. Individuals and organizations are encouraged to do something to take care of Mother Earth. Meanwhile, businesses the world over have also started to realize that helping or spearheading campaigns that solve environment-related problems, along with poverty and hunger, is not just hip but is actually good for business. Organizations are starting to realize that the world needs them and that they cannot rely completely on government and civic actions to solve the problems that all of us share.

The World Economic Forum recently published a write-up detailing specific areas where businesses can have an impact on the campaign to save the planet. So to help celebrate World Environment Day and share information that has the potential to inspire others to join the efforts, I wish to share the discussions here.

First on the list is the suggestion for business organizations to invest in nature-based solutions. This means putting some money into nature-based efforts to reduce carbon. Some examples include the preservation and conservation of marine protected areas, forests, soil, coastlines and ocean.

The creation and promotion of a circular economy is also highly encouraged. A circular economy is one where products are designed in such a way that they don’t have to be immediately thrown out but rather reused or recycled. Organizations have the resources and capability to create business models, like the sharing economy, so people don’t need to own or buy stuff like we used to.

The use of clean technology— solar energy and other low-carbon energy options—is highly encouraged as this has been proven to reduce CO2 emissions from electricity generation. In fact, when clean technology is used, it does not only help address climate issues. According to the WE Forum report, it also helps tackle “illegal fishing, increase the traceability of materials, enabling better management of forests using satellite imagery and on-the-ground sensors.”

Finally, governments are encouraged to come up with carbon-pricing schemes so that more companies will invest in cleaner production, thereby reducing their carbon emissions, or to fund research into fuel cells or renewable-energy subsidies.

Experts argue that if greenhouse- gas emissions become expensive, businesses are going to clean up their act and even “help shape carbon markets we need in the future.”

Scientists say we only have a few years to act, before it becomes too late. Children and children’s organizations all over the world have stepped up their campaigns to call for bigger efforts to save the planet. Every single action counts. Individuals and families have to do their part. Businesses have to wake up and work with everyone else, too, because they can certainly create greater impact considering their size, resources and influence.",United States,2019.06
60,Finland’s commodity exports to Nigeria hit €35m,"The Team Lead, West and Central Africa, Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland, Jussi Nummelin, says Finland exported €35m worth of goods to Nigeria in 2018.

Speaking with our correspondent on the sidelines of the World Circular Economic Forum 2019 in Finland on Wednesday, he said the export to Nigeria majorly comprised industrial goods as well as power and telecommunication equipment.

On the other hand, he said that Nigeria’s export to Finland was low and mainly made up of agricultural products.

Nummelin noted that there were opportunities for the Nigerian economy to thrive in the areas of clean renewable energy as the oil and gas industry had become riddled with many challenges and negatively impacting environmental sustainability.

He expressed concerns that the insecurity in Nigeria was affecting the business decision of investors who were interested in doing business in Nigeria.

Nummelin, however, encouraged Finnish companies to explore business opportunities in Nigeria in order to improve trade relations between both countries.

“Nigeria is a typical African economy. The difficulties in developing markets are huge but in different scales. We are concerned about the security in Sahel region. Climate change has massive consequences if we don’t address the causes. What happens in Nigeria in terms of instability is crucial because the country has a way of leading others in the West African region,” he added.

He also encouraged the Nigerian president to sign the African Continental Free Trade agreement into law for the country to remain competitive.

According to him, signing the trade pact will give entrepreneurs in Nigeria unrestricted access to over 1.2 billion market in Africa.

“The need for reforms in the economy is big. The free economy market is an opportunity to sell to more consumers beyond the local market,” he added.

The AfCFTA aims to accelerate intra-Africa trade and boost the continent’s trading position in the global market and enhance the competitiveness of industries and enterprises and eliminate 90 per cent of tariffs.

The free trade pact, however, kicked off on May 30, 2019, with 24 countries out of 54 ratifying the agreement.

The 24 countries that have signed the agreement have until July to develop strategies and implement the deal.

Benin, Eritea, South Africa and Nigeria are some of the countries that have yet to sign the pact.

President Muhammadu Buhari had refused to join the continental free-trade zone established in March last year, on the grounds that it wished to defend its own businesses and industry.

The president later said it wanted more time to consult business leaders, Reuters reported.

“In trying to guarantee employment, goods and services in our country, we have to be careful with agreements that will compete, maybe successfully, against our upcoming industries,” Buhari told a news conference during a visit by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa to Nigeria.

63,Editorial: California has to stop thinking small in the fight against plastic trash,"There’s no doubt that the tiny plastic shampoo and lotion bottles provided to hotel customers are extravagantly wasteful. At most, they contain enough product for a couple of uses before they are tossed. But they represent just a small drop in the ocean-sized environmental disaster of single-use plastic items that are piling up in landfills and clogging the seas.

Yet these hotel toiletry bottles are the sole focus of AB 1162, a bill that passed through the California Assembly last month and is headed for consideration in the state Senate. The measure would prohibit all hotels and other lodging establishments in the state from handing out such bottles unless requested, starting in 2024.

Lawmakers should not waste their energy on such a trivial law. Besides, the hotel industry is already moving away from these personal-size toiletries. Big chains, such as Marriott and Holiday Inn Express, are switching to larger, refillable containers.

Banning plastic grocery bags and beverage straws was the right way at the time to focus the public’s attention on the problem of single-use plastic products and containers. But now that people understand that whales are choking to death on plastic bags and other plastic products, and that every piece of plastic ever made still exists in some form, lawmakers can and should turn their focus to bigger, more disruptive actions.

Enter the Fray: First takes on the news of the minute »

Happily, there is legislation also progressing through the Legislature that takes a more comprehensive approach. SB 54 by Sen. Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica) and its Assembly companion bill, AB 1080 by Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego), would establish the groundbreaking California Circular Economy and Plastic Pollution Reduction Act, a law with a complicated name but a simple goal: slashing all single-use plastic waste in California by 75% over the next decade.

If we want to stop covering the Earth in discarded plastic trash before the end of the century, we’re going to have to stop addressing the problem with minuscule, penny-ante policies.

In its current form, the proposed law requires manufacturers of any kind of disposable plastic — mainly product packaging — to achieve a 20% recycling rate by 2024, gradually increasing to a 75% rate by 2030. This sounds like a low initial bar, but the reality is that many plastics are virtually unrecyclable, and beyond that, the market for recyclables has contracted dramatically. So the practical effect of the law is that many manufacturers would have to invest significantly in equipment, facilities and programs to increase their recycling rate — or their product couldn’t be sold in California.

Both bills are working their way through their respective houses, despite the not-inconsiderable pushback from plastics manufacturers and business trade groups. Some of the issues that have been raised are valid and should be addressed, such as the ambiguity of some key terms (just what does “single-use” mean?) and whether food safety might be compromised. But the legislation should not be diluted with so many concessions that it becomes toothless. The reality is that the problem of plastic trash is too big to solve without serious disruption to how products are made, packaged and discarded.

How big? Roughly estimated, 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic have been produced in the last 70 years, and less than 10% of it has been recycled. Most of it has ended up in landfills or in the ocean, where it is killing sea animals that mistake the plastic bits for food. Plastic doesn’t biodegrade like organic material. It breaks down into microscopic particles that have invaded every corner of the planet, including our food and drinking water.

These two proposed laws create a stark choice for California — and for the U.S., which has been shamefully slow to address the single-use plastic problem. Either the state can continue to think small by banning the annoying plastic product of the moment, or it can step up to be the desperately needed model for plastic trash reduction the nation needs.

64,"Over half of consumers would pay extra for sustainably designed products, survey says","More than half of consumers said they would pay more for sustainable products designed to be reused or recycled, according to results of a survey from Accenture (Dublin, Ireland; www.accenture.com).

 

The survey of 6,000 consumers in 11 countries across North America, Europe and Asia, results of which were previewed at the American Chemistry Council (ACC) Annual Meeting today, found that while consumers remain primarily focused on quality and price, 83% believe it’s important or extremely important for companies to design products that are meant to be reused or recycled. Nearly three-quarters (72%) of respondents said they’re currently buying more environmentally friendly products than they were five years ago, and 81% said they expect to buy more over the next five years.

 

“The shift in consumer buying, with more consumers willing to pay extra for environmentally friendly products, reinforces the need for companies to increase their commitments to responsible business practices,” said Jessica Long, a managing director in Accenture Strategy. “Companies across industries have started to lead with purpose including embracing the circular economy as a greater opportunity to drive growth and competitive agility.”

 

Unsurprisingly, quality and price led consumers’ considerations when making purchases, cited by 89% and 84% of respondents, respectively, compared with 49% who cited health and safety considerations and 37% who cited environmental impact.

 

The survey findings also indicate that consumers believe that the chemical industry — which plays a key role in driving recycled and reusable technologies and materials — lacks concern about its environmental impact. Specifically, one in four consumers (26%) said they believe that the chemical industry is the least concerned of nine industries included in the survey about its impact on the environment.

 

Consumers also ranked chemical companies the lowest among industries for the reliability of communications regarding the environmental impact of their products and services, with 72% not very confident or not confident at all in these communications.

 

“While some of the survey results are encouraging, there are also implications for chemical companies, including the need to overcome negative consumer sentiment and to produce sustainable materials at a competitive price,” said Rachael Bartels, a senior managing director at Accenture who leads its chemicals and natural resources practice. “The chemical industry is a critical enabler to the circular economy and can speed up its adoption, and the reality is the industry must get in front of this now, or risk being left behind.”

 

In other survey findings, plastics was perceived to be the least environmentally friendly type of packaging, cited by more than three-fourths (77%) of consumers, with paper products perceived to be the most environmentally friendly, cited by 55% of respondents.

 

Resolving these and other challenges could help chemical companies fuel growth. For instance, the ACC estimates that a circular economy for plastics could add 38,500 jobs and billions of dollars to the U.S. economy by expanding the use of pyrolysis and other advanced plastic recycling technologies. Chemical companies have an opportunity to catalyze and capture a significant share of the US$4.5 trillion in opportunity presented by a move to a circular economy, according to circular economy research from Accenture Strategy.

 

To identify consumer purchasing and consumption habits regarding different types of packaging and products, as well as consumer views related to recycling and reuse of materials, Accenture surveyed 6,000 consumers, ages 18 to 70, in 11 countries: the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, the United Kingdom, China, India, Indonesia and Japan. The survey was conducted in April 2019.

65,Nordic Embassies Organize Beach Clean-Up Operation in Morocco,"As part of the celebration of World Ocean Day under the theme of ""Ocean and Gender"", the embassies of Norway, Finland, Sweden and Denmark are organizing a beach clean-up operation in partnership with the public.

Rabat – World Ocean Day will take place on June 8 and, in observance of the occasion, the embassies of Norway, Finland, Sweden and Denmark have been organizing a special beach clean-up. This event will happen with the theme of “Ocean and Gender.”

Specifically, the objective is to use the event as a platform to sensitize the population about waste management and to educate about the role both genders must equally play in keeping the coastline and the oceans clean. The clean-up is set to start in the morning of June 8, 2019, at the shoreline of Oudayas, Rabat, from 9:00 to 11:00.

Through this activity, individuals from the Nordic government offices and civil society associations, including The Green Challenge, intend to urge local commitment to discover solutions for the ecological difficulties confronting Morocco.

Once the clean-up has concluded, the event coordinators will gather the waste before sorting it according to the standards of Tadweir company. Tadweir will, at that point, sort the waste in their containment facility and recycle it into new products; cloth will be used to create new fabrics and plastic waste will be turned into containers.

This year, the World Ocean Day clean-up will team-up with the Chourouk Center and other NGOs to focus on the importance of gender equality and empowerment. The aim is to include women and girls in the conversation on sustainability in order to find holistic solutions to modern environmental challenges.

Fortifying the sustainable management of plastic waste is essential, particularly in vulnerable coastal areas. World Ocean Day is a chance to emphasize protecting marine life by battling against plastic pollution in our seas and oceans. This will be done on a local scale, but with a global perspective in mind. l Today, we produce around 300 million tons of plastic waste every year, of which 13 million tons are released into the seas, presenting environmental, economic, health and aesthetic problems.

Somewhere in the range of 80% and 90% of marine litter originates from land-based sources, which is a clear sign of the priorities in which we should center our endeavors. The other 10-20 % is from miscellaneous sources.

The Nordic nations have, for many years, shared a solid commitment to the protection of nature and regard for the earth is profoundly established in Nordic values.

It translates concretely into ambitious public policies; the adoption of good practices at the individual level; innovation of the clean technology industry.

The Nordic nations have aspiring ideas for sustainable power sources, vitality, productivity, and the circular economy – an economic approach of reutilizing resources.",United States,2019.06
68,Coca Cola invests P1 billion for Philippine recycling plant,"MANILA, Philippines — Coca Cola Beverages Philippines Inc. (CCBPI) is investing P1 billion in a recycling facility to turn plastic bottles into new ones.

In a statement, CCBPI, Coca Cola’s bottling arm, said the investment is the first to be made by the company for a recycling facility in Southeast Asia.

Details on the location of the recycling facility were not available as of press time.

CCBPI is in discussions with potential partners including a local firm, and an internationally-recognized green technology company for the facility.

Utilizing the circular economy concept, the recycling facility will be collecting, sorting, cleaning and washing post-consumer PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastic bottles and turning them into new ones.

“Coca-Cola has called the Philippines its home for 107 years and counting, and we want to do our part in ensuring sustainability within its shores,” CCBPI president and chief executive officer Gareth McGeown said.

“Our Coca-Cola bottles and cans are 100 percent recyclable and have value as a recycled material. Our aspiration with this facility is to close the loop on our packaging by helping turn old bottles into new ones. This facility is testament to our resolve in making our World Without Waste vision a reality across the country, with real positive impact not just across our value chain, but also in the communities where we belong,” he said.

CCBPI’s recycling facility is expected to help improve PET collection and recycling rates in the country.

In addition, it is seen to create more jobs in the waste materials value chain, which includes the picking and collection of bottles.

The investment forms part of Coca Cola’s global commitment to collect and recycle every bottle and can it sells by 2030 in line with its goal to have a “World Without Waste.”

“World Without Waste is an important and very ambitious goal and we are confident that by working together with our partners, we can deliver on our commitments here in the Philippines. The bottle-to-bottle closed loop investment that we are announcing today is a model for how we want to grow sustainably and responsibly.

We recognize that there is a packaging waste problem in the world today and this investment is one of the ways we are stepping up to be part of the solution for the long-haul,” McGeown said.",United States,2019.06
70,"Iberostar’s New Coral Lab Opens for World Oceans Day, Offering Hope for the Future of Caribbean Reefs and Oceans Everywhere","Ahead of World Oceans Day (June 8), Iberostar Group is opening a new land-based coral lab in the heart of the Caribbean. It will help protect essential ocean life from rising global temperatures in the future—and defend against a new fast-moving coral pandemic today.

Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease (SCTLD) has cut a ghostly wake of bleached-out coral bones from Central Florida, where it first appeared in 2014, to Mexico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, St. Maarten, and now the Dominican Republic, where it suddenly arrived in March.

Dr. Megan Morikawa, Iberostar's Director of Sustainability, who is a Marine Biologist with a PhD in coral restoration, saw this underwater white plague coming as she and her team hatched plans for the new coral lab in the Dominican Republic. Moving at an unprecedented pace, a band of people from the scientific community, Iberostar, the Dominican government, NGOs and others finished the lab in a year, just as the coral disease started infecting local reefs—eight months sooner than expected.

""We didn't realize it when we started the project, but we were building Noah's Ark for coral,"" Dr. Morikawa says.

The coral lab, which opens Saturday, will house 10 species initially—180 individual corals (most facilities only contain a few species). Built in the footprint of a former yoga palapa, the center operates under rigorous scientific standards but is open to visitors, including children in Iberostar's Star Camp entertainment program.

""This is much-needed science in an unexpected location,"" Dr. Morikawa says, adding that corals represent just 1% of the world's surface but hold about a third of the world's biological diversity.

The lab is the latest effort in Iberostar's Wave of Change movement, a three-pronged approach to protecting oceans and encouraging responsible tourism, that includes:
• Moving beyond plastics in all Iberostar's 120 hotels by 2020 through reimagining every use, from straws and coffee pods to employee uniforms in an effort to establish a circular economy.
• Promoting sustainable seafood consumption; among other efforts, Iberostar has partnered with the WWF, FishWise and local fish suppliers to ban entire species from hotel restaurant menus.
• Improving coastal health, including mangrove restoration in the Dominican Republic, assembling a team of scientific experts in coastal conservation including Dr. Morikawa and others from Stanford University and UC Santa Barbara, and more.

With 32,000 employees serving 8 million clients per year, Iberostar has the unique power to educate and inspire people and its industry peers to drive broad change.

""As a family business who has been part of the community in the Dominican Republic for more than 25 years, we are establishing a tourism model that is every time more responsible and allows for a better legacy for the future generations of this country. We have to acknowledge this responsibility and keep taking bold steps,"" says Gloria Fluxa, Iberostar's Vice Chairman and Chief Sustainability Officer, a fourth-generation leader in the 100% family owned tourism business.

The onshore lab will serve as a haven for threatened Caribbean coral. It is a genetic bank, protected from increasingly destructive hurricanes offshore where most reef farms live. Plus, it pulls saltwater from wells, not the ocean, making it safe from fast-moving, broad reaching coral diseases such as SCTLD.

Among its features, the lab has four 1,200-liter tanks, four more 500-liter tanks and four control systems that will allow researchers to accurately simulate future ocean conditions, so they can develop and grow heat-resistant coral strains that could one day replenish the ailing reefs that sustain entire fish populations and protect coastal livelihoods.

Putting all of this together on such a tight timeline and on land was a Herculean effort that required innovation and collaboration, Dr. Morikawa says. Iberostar's hotel staff pitched in on construction and design. Government officials helped navigate permits. Engineers and aquarists were flown in to consult on the design, and a spa company built controls for the tanks. ""Everyone was pitching in. It gave us a beautiful local perspective,"" Dr. Morikawa says, ""I never would have expected that we would build a lab facility in a year, but we had no choice, we were running out of time.""

Iberostar plans to open more coastal health facilities in other locations within the next two years and hatch a number of offshore nurseries.

Importantly, the lab was designed to give clients and local community a one-of-a-kind, indelible ocean experience on land and expose them to an environmental challenge they might otherwise never know about.

""I think what is most important is that hotels can contribute to protecting our oceans in ways we didn't quite expect,"" Dr. Morikawa says. ""Ironically, we as a scientific community have been working for years on building an economic case for saving coral reefs. What hooked Iberostar was purely wanting to protect them.""",United States,2019.06
71,"Malta Could Learn A Lot About Waste Management From Sweden, The Country That's Officially 'Run Out Of Rubbish'","Recycling and waste management are such major issues in both the national and European political climates that the words reduce, reuse, recycle are probably burned into our brains. However, despite this, many people, businesses and individuals alike seem to not understand the severity of accumulating waste in landfills.

The Swedish nation, on the other hand, have excelled in their revolutionary waste management systems and have achieved so much that, to us Maltese, it seems almost impossible. However, with both legislative amendments and small personal lifestyle changes, we can make major strides towards the European 2020 goal.

In 2016, almost 50% of Sweden’s 212,500 tonnes of plastic was recycled. Two years later, a grand total of only 7% of all Maltese rubbish was recycled



This figure already surpassed Sweden’s 2020 goal, however, this is arguably one of their less impressive feats, as the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released an image (below) which shows that they exceeded their targets in glass, plastic and paper recycling, with 93% of glass being recycled compared to their 70% target.

In Malta, on the other hand, we actually recycled 15.3% less materials than we did the previous year, which was mainly caused by a reduction in the recycling of construction and excavation waste. Furthermore, only 8.6% of Malta’s municipal waste (mixed black bag rubbish) was recycled in 2017, a figure that is actually lower than it was in 2013, when 9.8% was recycled.

Sweden is currently pushing towards a zero-waste circular economy, much like Malta, however theirs seems actually feasible within the not-so-distant future. For those who don’t know, a circular economy is an economic system which tries to minimise waste while making the most of resources, which is very different to the take-make-waste approach many systems currently use.

So how has Sweden achieved all of this?

Well first of all, their recycling system is so good, that less than 1% of household waste ended up in a landfill each year since 2011, and the country had to literally import the waste from neighbouring states to keep their plants running as effectively as possible.

They also have countless policies in place that intend to encourage citizens to comply with sustainable behaviours. In 2017, for example, the government reformed the tax system in such a way that people could get cheaper repairs on used items to discourage discarding still-usable goods and, back in 1991, they imposed a tax on fossil fuels to being moving towards more renewable energy sources.

The global Swedish clothing brand H&M also offers a recycling scheme where patrons can receive a discount on their purchases if they return older clothing items. The government is even researching new, more sustainable materials to produce textiles with.

Sweden was also early to the party in terms of can and bottle deposit systems, introducing a money-back recycling scheme for aluminium cans in 1984, and one for plastic bottles in 1994

Nowadays, the country recycles 1.8 billion – yes, billion – cans and bottles every year that would otherwise end up in landfills.

Oh, and let’s not forget that they also get rid of a lot of waste by turning it into energy, powering buses and internal heating systems by burning rubbish with low-carbon incinerators or by turning food waste into climate-friendly biogas fuel.

What is Malta doing to combat the plastic problem?

Malta also operates a bottle return system, where people receive 10 eurocents for ever plastic, glass or metal bottle they return to specialised machines set up around the island.

Apart from that, Malta also had a scheme where fisherman could receive compensation for the plastic they pick up from the sea-floor and hand in to be recycled.

A few years ago, the government tried to encourage more people to transfer to renewable energy sources by introducing a subsidy on solar panels and a scheme which allows people to get reimbursed for any excess energy generated and sold back to the grid.

What can you do personally?

Apart from the bottle deposit scheme, there are actually many small changes the average Joe can adopt that will greatly impact the quality of waste management in Malta.

Ida Lemoine, founder of Beteendelabbet, a Swedish organisation that focuses on sustainable living, states that there a three small changes that individuals could do to live more sustainably, namely “eat less meat, stop throwing stuff away and fly less”.

Now I understand that we kind of need to take a flight if we want to visit anywhere quite far away, however, for your next trip to Sicily, maybe consider taking the catamaran instead, or using trains to travel through Europe over connecting flights.

Apart from that, you could also make an effort to separate and recycle your own waste, or dedicate some of your free time to helping with events like beach clean-ups. Plus, I’m sure you can remember at least one more thing from your Form 4 Geography lessons on sustainability that you haven’t fully adopted into your life.

The sad truth is that Malta is simply not moving towards a sustainable future fast enough, so we as a collective whole need to stop watching grass die and get off our asses before there’s no grass left for us to kill.

74,Circular economy is a mindset companies need as well,"Major environmental issues are at stake. The seas and marine species are full of plastic, the atmospheric carbon dioxide level is higher than ever before in the history of measurement, food scandals generate uncertainty, clean drinking water is running out, urbanisation is increasing traffic and worsening the pollution problems… Consumption is the thing that runs the world economy.

For example, as regards food, the circular economy is closely connected to elimination of waste and the use of side streams. In bio-based raw materials, we are investing in such matters as recycling of textiles and, in the future, increasingly in high added-value products. Good biomass should not be transformed into energy before we have gotten whatever we can out of the fibres first. Over various lifecycles.

In the consumer sector, clothing industry is an excellent example of how the turnover rate and trends change. Cheap clothing stores stormed into the Finnish market in the early 2000’s, the season lasted a few weeks − and so did the clothes. The Finnish clothing industry went bankrupt, because it was impossible to succeed in competition. This was the case until a growing number of consumers started to demand higher quality and ethical standards from manufacturing, and to become worried about the amount of fibres ending up in landfills and the carbon footprint they are producing.

Increasing numbers of consumers are prepared to make bigger initial investments in products with a longer lifecycle that will serve the user reliably till the end of their useful life. Afterwards, the product or the materials used for making the product can be modified to new purposes. This will lower the costs over the product’s whole lifecycle. The requirement specifications for the products are in the hands of final users.

Opportunities for the industry: re-use, remanufacture and recycling of materials

The same circular economy opportunities apply to the industrial sector. The after-sales service business typically accounts for more than half of the overall turnover or equipment manufacturers, and, at their longest, machinery and equipment can have lifecycles counted in dozens of years. The product palette of equipment manufacturers had included revamp concepts of machinery of the type ‘re-build, renovation’ long before anyone had ever heard about the circular economy. Instead of a machine or process, several equipment suppliers sell their customers production capacity tied to specific quality parameters, applying the pricing model basic production + bonus (penalty).

When not only the design and manufacturing of equipment but also its use and maintenance are the responsibility of the equipment manufacturer, the financial analysis begins to be genuinely based on the lifecycle costs, covering the costs from manufacturing to predictive maintenance, spare and replaceable parts and re-use. The re-use, remanufacture and recycling of materials are enabled specifically at the designer’s desk. By his or her choices, the designer defines about 80% of the lifecycle costs of machinery.

Sharing of data necessary for success in the circular economy

Like in any systemic challenge, ultimately it all culminates in data, the connectivity of data and open sharing of data on different platforms. We are still in the early phases of the process and it requires a lot of development. We lack models and evaluation tools needed for the value creation throughout the cycle and, further along, fair distribution of the value created. Why would anyone make valuable decisions with a view to the whole product cycle at a component level for instance if it does not bring any commercial added value to the decision-maker? Traceability calls for new tools in support of ethical, ecological and financial decision-making. There are various tools based on a gamification approach under development, but they need to be backed up by vast amounts of reliable data.

A lot of the decisions are made at B2B interfaces, but in the circular economy the role and behavioural patterns of consumers (B2C) are also becoming increasingly important. For this reason, a circular economy needs a whole lot of personal and easy-to-understand fact-based communications enabled by new information. Here, as researchers, we need to challenge ourselves to take a new kind of competence leap.

Systemic challenges can only be solved in collaboration with others. We need new kinds of cooperation models, such as ecosystems. In the circular economy theme, the same challenge may offer opportunities for a globe providing well-being for the coming generations and lucrative business for present-day enterprises.",United States,2019.06
75,"Estée Lauder Touts Circular Economy Initiatives, Joins CE100","Skincare and makeup giant Estée Lauder says it will continue its efforts to help drive a circular economy through sustainable packaging innovation and is backing up its claim by becoming a member of the Circular Economy 100 program, run by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

The CE100 is a global platform that brings together cross-industry corporations, governments, cities, academic institutions and emerging innovators from around the world to “accelerate the transition to a circular economy,” the organization says. The network enables members to collaborate in the hopes they will unlock new opportunities that support the objective of building a framework for an economy that is restorative and regenerative by design.

Estée Lauder says its packaging designers and engineers are re-working the company’s packaging portfolio, including using low-impact sourcing, bio-sourcing, material substitute, weight elimination and integration of recycled content. The company plans that by the end of 2025, 75% to 100% of the packaging of its brands will be recyclable, refillable, reusable, recycled or recoverable; in achieving this goal, the Company will increase the amount of post-consumer recycled material in packaging by up to 50%.

Earlier this week, another skincare brand, Olay, announced that it is piloting new packaging for its bestselling Olay Regenerist Whip moisturizer. During the pilot, the moisturizer will be sold with a refill pod that fits into the original moisturizer jar. If the pilot is successful and the company rolls out the refill pods as a product to be purchased separately, the company says it could save as much as a million pounds of plastic.",United States,2019.06
78,World-first wonky broccoli crisps embrace circular economy,"Broccoli is getting a new lease on life under the Grower’s Garden umbrella.

Based in the east of Scotland in Fife, the farmer’s cooperative of 16 growers have worked hand-in-hand for generations to supply retail with fresh produce like broccoli, cauliflower, kale, red cabbage, white cabbage and Brussel sprouts.

But, as nature will have it, the veg is not always perfect, and some is rejected by retail for being too big or too small.

Enter the world’s first wonky broccoli crisp, which ticks all the boxes: Vegan, low cal, gluten-free and sustainable, and puts food waste to shame.

Each pack of Grower’s Garden crisps is made with the fresh broccoli that does not quite fit the bill for retail, aligned with the coop’s circular economy mission to reduce waste, emissions and energy use.

According to Alan Wallace, commercial manager of Grower’s Garden, the response to the unique snack since its launch in December has been overwhelming.

“We use the wonky veg from our production of broccoli to add value to what has become a commodity crop,”​ he told BakeryandSnacks’ sister publication DairyReporter at the Free From Expo, held in Barcelona, Spain, at the end of May.

“We believe it to be a world first. The first ever crisp using fresh broccoli and not only that, but the number one ingredient is fresh broccoli.”​

Available in four variants – including Naked, Chilli, Sour Cream & Chive and Cheese – the crisps (chips) are vegan, gluten-free, a good source of fiber, low in saturated fat and the 22g bags contain less than 100 calories.

They are also low in sugar and salt, and free from lactose, wheat, nuts and soy.

“It’s a healthy alternative to conventional crisps,”​ said Wallace, adding Grower’s Garden is currently rejigging its formulation to increase the crisps’ broccoli content from 27%-29% to around 40%.

“We’re also looking to reduce the salt content ever so slightly, at which point all four packs will comply with the UK’s National Health Services’ healthy living guidelines.”​

Despite its infancy, the coop-cum-snack-producer has big plans in the pipeline.

It will be extending the broccoli range with additional flavors and is even playing with the same technology to use up the coop’s other wonky veg.

“For this Christmas, our goal is – and its ambitious – to have a Brussel sprout crisp that looks like a crisp and tastes as good as a crisp, but the number one ingredient will be fresh Brussel sprouts,” ​said Wallace.",United States,2019.06

81,Circular Economy Part II: A funding model from Finland – and for Hong Kong?,"Harbour Times reporter Elise Mak travelled to Finland to explore how the county is adopting the concept of a circular economy and the lessons it holds for Hong Kong

HELSINKI. The Hong Kong government is bent on focusing on technology to ensure a better future and boost the city’s competitiveness. The Achilles heel of these efforts might be funding that gives rise to independent, long-term thinking and effective projects.

On this front, there might be lessons to be found in Finland and its push to create a fund to develop circular economy technologies and key projects with very limited timeframes.

Finland’s forward-looking vision for a circular economy was created by Sitra, the country’s future fund that promotes future-oriented initiatives. To avoid political influence, Sitra is self-funded and focuses on providing long-term financing for projects.

In an exclusive interview with Harbour Times, Mr Tapio Anttila, executive vice president of Sitra, discussed Sitra’s unique model to guarantee continuity and independence to execute the country’s forward-looking development plan.

“Sitra is more than a think tank. It is a think-do-connect tank. We now aim for a systemic change in society,” says Mr Anttila.

Having all stakeholders onboard, he believes Sitra represents the joint efforts by the entire country.

Finland first put plans in place to secure a better future for its people half a century ago through a financially and politically independent fund.

In 1967, Sitra was established by the Finnish Parliament as a gift to celebrate the 50thanniversary of the country’s independence. The Bank of Finland granted 16.8 million euros to Sitra as endowment capital to generate future profits to finance future-oriented projects.

With additional grants over the years, the endowment capital has grown.

With this money, Sitra invests in a diverse portfolio: shares of Nokia, unit-linked insurance, real estate private equity funds and so forth.

Today, Sitra’s operations are funded by returns that average around EUR30 million every year from its endowment capital investments. At the end of 2018, the market value of Sitra’s endowment capital amounted to ERU776 million euros.

“We are a professional investor and we do risk analysis,” Mr Anttila explains.

While the return from Sitra’s endowment fluctuates – 7.7 percent in 2017 and -3.9 percent in 2018, Mr Anttila says Sitra allocates around 4 percent of the returns every year to fund its operations.

“Sitra’s role as an independent party, not funded by the central government or businesses, was extremely significant as it allowed the participants in the process to feel that the starting points were impartial and fair,” is how the fund describes itself.

Sitra reports directly to the Finnish Parliament rather than the government that changes every few years.

Even though its supervisory board is made up of parliament members and its Board of Directors includes three ministries, Sitra has remained politically neutral and focused on providing solutions to meet the goals.

“The supervisory board is formed by MPs from all political parties,” says Mr Anttila, dismissing the possibility that Sitra might lean to a certain political spectrum as governments change.

He stresses that the future fund has a well-balanced representation.

“We identify an issue, then carry out experiments and research and invite open discussions. We provide fact-based solutions rather than opinion,” he explains of Sitra’s work.

He believes Sitra’s quality work can convince the decision makers and the public, so the organisation can be exempt from drastic changes demanded and made by them.

“You need a good name to gain people’s trust when you want to push things ahead,” Mr Anttila explains.

Sitra’s role has also evolved over the years to ensure it stays influential.

During its first two decades, Sitra funded R&D projects. In 1983, the Finnish government established the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation, now known as Business Finland, to provide funding for startups.

“Sitra funded many research projects that led to fruitful results in the early days. But to scale up these projects, it’s not our task anymore,” says Mr Anttila. “Business Finland is the accelerator to make these projects happen faster.”

To keep its financial position solid, Sitra handed over the task of funding research and startups to Business Finland. From the 1980s to 2000s, Sitra focused on venture capital investments in Finland to keep the money growing.

Another important measure by Sitra is giving its activities a limited timespan.

“The most important phase of our projects’ life cycle is the exit. You need to know when to leave,” says Mr Anttila. “When we start to plan activities, we always ask ourselves when is our exit. There’s no point to do anything without this idea of who will take over next. There’s no area that we can stay for good.”

One of the “exits” Sitra uses is the Smart & Clean Foundation, which is given five years to work on climate and circular solutions in the Finnish capital Helsinki after being a project funded by Sitra. The foundation started its work in 2016. During its five years of operations, the foundation will work towards its goals using the funds raised from multiple participants that include businesses, cities, research institutes and the Finnish government.

Samuli Laita, communication specialists at Sitra, says the limited timespan strategy works well.

“Knowing that there’s only five years’ time and you’ll need to go, you’ll work extra hard to make things happen,” he explains.",United States,2019.06
85,Australia’s experience in applying circular economy,"Speech by Mr Finn Pratt AO PSM, Secretary, Department of the Environment and Energy

on the 2019 Annual General Meeting of the China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development

It is wonderful to be back in China to participate in the China Council Annual General Meeting.

May I first pay tribute to Minister Li Ganjie and your hardworking team at the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.

Under your leadership, the environment agenda has risen to a top-tier issue in China. And under your guidance, China has made important strides.

I would also like to acknowledge Peng Jiaxue, Vice Governor of Zhejiang Province.

In 2017, just six weeks into my position as Secretary of Australia’s Department of Environment and Energy, I came to China for my first China Council Annual General Meeting.

In 2019, just two weeks into a newly elected Government in Australia, I have returned to China for my third visit.

This is no accident. Why?

First, when it comes to environment and energy, what China does matters. It matters for China, for Australia, and for the world.

Both Australia and China are energy powerhouses. Both countries have experienced remarkable economic growth.

Our nations have substantial coal and gas reserves, as well as an abundance of renewable energy.

We have cutting-edge research and technology for new energy.

Australia and China face the challenge of transforming our economies to meet the demands of a cleaner future.

Third, I have prioritised a visit to China because Australia and China have a strong and mutually beneficial partnership. The Australian Government considers a constructive relationship with China a priority.

This doesn’t mean that Australia and China will always agree.

What is important is that channels of communication be kept open, that differences are handled respectfully, while focusing on positive fundamentals.

This was the approach endorsed by Prime Minister Morrison when he met Premier Li Keqiang in November last year.

Australia and China stand together on the multilateral stage, from the Convention on Biological Diversity to UNESCO, and from G20 to the World Trade Organisation.

Australia and China have deep policy exchange with over 40 mechisms.

Australia was the first country to establish a climate partnership with China 16 years ago, and the most recent addition has been a new Ministerial Dialogue on Energy.

So, it is fitting – early in our new Government’s tenure – that I build on this foundation at the China Council.

As we look to the future – and to China’s 14th Five-Year Plan – I was pleased to see that green consumption and circular economy feature strongly in the CCICED policy recommendations.

Today, I’d like to focus on the idea of a circular economy and how Australia is applying the idea.

I hope this provides some inspiration for our discussions and for China’s 14th Five-Year Plan.



Around the world, countries are developing and implementing resource efficiency and materials management policies under the broad heading of circular economy.

There is no single agreed definition of circular economy that applies to all countries. Australia sees circular economy as the way in which we achieve ecologically sustainable development. It is a principle to guide our work.

The drive to produce goods and services more cheaply has delivered many benefits – economic growth, greater food security, health benefits and convenience.

However, we are quickly learning that convenience and affluence are having quite serious consequences for our environment.

Plastics are a major source of marine pollution, and harmful chemicals and emissions are causing biodiversity loss and pollution of waterways and the atmosphere.

Circular economy recognises the environmental impacts linked to the extraction, manufacture, use, and disposal of materials.

It also recognises that these materials are finite and that the choices we make today will impact future generations.

Circular economy involves minimising harmful environmental impacts by ensuring that materials are kept in the highest value use in the economy for the longest possible time.

· repairing rather than replacing, and

· recycling rather than disposing of products at the end of their life.

Each nation’s path towards a circular economy will be different.

Approaches will vary according to the structure of the economy, the natural endowments, and the international trade connections.

Each country will have different opportunities and different challenges.



Australia, like China, has a strong resources sector, with extensive mineral and energy resources.

Australia also has a small manufacturing sector, therefore we import most of our consumer goods.

Australia’s approach to circular economy must take into account our trading environment, our position in global supply chains and the international nature of the environmental impacts of our activity.

International trade is important to allowing different countries to use their comparative advantages to contribute to slowing, narrowing, or closing material loops.

It enables secondary materials to be recovered and reused in countries where they are most commercially viable.

Progress in ensuring that products are designed to maximise reuse, reparability, and recyclability will therefore require engagement with our trading partners.

Australia, like China, has the challenge of implementing policy across multiple tiers of government.

Australia’s sub-national state and territory governments, together with local government, hold much of the responsibility for waste management and recycling policy and services.

Like the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, my department holds a leadership role in bringing together states and territories towards a national approach to circular economy.



I’d like to now speak about how my department is using circular economy to guide its approach to waste and recycling.

In December 2018, all Australian environment ministers and the Australian Local Government Association agreed to a new National Waste Policy based on circular economy principles.

Ministers also agreed to the development of a National Action Plan to implement the Policy.

The Plan will include targets and milestones to drive action, and it will address waste priorities including:

To support these outcomes, the Australian Government has recently announced a number of initiatives.

These include a comprehensive Australian Recycling Investment Plan, to increase recycling rates, tackle plastic waste and litter, and accelerate work on recycling e-waste.

The Investment Plan includes a new Australian Recycling Investment Fund to support manufacturing of lower emissions and energy-efficient recycled content products.

Australia has also announced a new Circular Economy Hub, to drive innovation and establish an online marketplace to match buyers and sellers of waste.



Plastic litter and debris is another major environmental issue and innovation will be critical to finding a solution. Through the Cooperative Research Centres program, the Australian Government will fund research and development related to plastics recycling.

Australia is also committed to working with our Pacific neighbours to reduce plastics and other marine waste in the region.

As part of our waste policies, the Australian Government released a National Food Waste Strategy in 2017.

Food waste is estimated to cost the Australian economy around $20 billion dollars each year. Australia generated 7.3 million tonnes of food waste in 2016-17 – approximately 300 kilograms per person.

The Strategy aims to halve Australia’s food waste by 2030.

The Australian Government is working with Food Innovation Australia Limited, an industry‑led organisation, to develop a plan to reduce waste in the supply and consumption of food.

Governments in Australia are taking further action to reduce the effects of products and materials on the environment and human health.A new Product Stewardship Investment Fund will accelerate work on industry-led recycling schemes including for batteries, electrical and electronic products, photovoltaic systems and plastic oil containers.

In addition, the Government has been working with industry to phaseout plastic microbeads in cosmetic, personal care and cleaning products. Around 94 per cent of these products are now free of microbeads and we are tackling the final six per cent.

Australia is also considering where energy-from-waste projects may be helpful in recovering waste that would otherwise go to landfill.

We are developing large energy-from-waste projects in New South Wales and Western Australia worth more than 1.5 billion dollars.

And, through our 10 billion dollar investment in the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Australian Government is trialling a project which will convert garden and food waste across Melbourne into compost for local parks and gardens.

Like Australia, China is making strides in achieving high-quality growth that balances economic, social and environmental outcomes.

As both countries pursue strong circular economies, there is much we can learn from one another.

Australia and China have an Action Plan for Environmental Cooperation. We are both among each other’s top trading partners, we have deep peopleto-people connections and rich cultural links.

The strength of our partnership provides a great foundation to exchange experience and collaborate in moving toward sustainable development.



Australia recognises the circular economy as an opportunity for improved environmental as well as economic outcomes.

We don’t have to choose between the environment and sustained economic growth.

But we do need to make smart choices to support green growth and green development.

We are working to promote green development in the Australian community and find global solutions to shared problems.

I applaud our hosts for making green development a key issue for discussion at this year’s meeting.",United States,2019.06
88,Waste management: designing a circular economy,"Household food waste is under the spotlight recently, with current estimates that we waste up to one third of the food we buy (costing about €700 per household per year). This means the contribution of food wastage emissions to global warming is almost equivalent to global road transport emissions.

Now, waste materials from the agricultural and food-processing industry is gaining attention as researchers seek new uses for everything from chicken manure to potato pulp.

Finding new, more profitable ways of using agricultural and food-processing waste materials was the focus of AgroCycle, a three-year long international study, led by researchers at the Agriculture and Food Science Centre at University College Dublin (UCD). The study, which received €7 million in funding from the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 and €1 million from the People’s Republic of China, had 26 partners across Europe and three in China.

“It’s important to stress that we’re talking about unavoidable waste – or byproducts – of agriculture and food processing. This is a global issue so working with Chinese researchers was of benefit to us,” says Dr Tom Curran, the project coordinator of AgroCycle and assistant professor at the school of Biosystems and Food Engineering at UCD.

Europe generates about 1.3 billion tonnes of waste every year, of which 700 million is agri-waste. The issue for much of these waste materials is that they currently have very low or no value and often cost money to be transported from farms and food-processing plants.

Take, for example, chicken manure – which chicken farmers in Monaghan and Cavan often pay to transport to tillage farmers in other parts of the country. The AgroCycle researchers found this manure could be used as a feedstock for bioreactors [anerobic digestors] to produce electricity.

“When we visited chicken farms in China, we realised that they could have enough feedstock to fuel a bio-refinery on site such are the scale of production facilities,” says Prof Shane Ward, professor of biosystems engineering at UCD.

New uses for waste materials such as rice bran, potato pulp, forest residues and waste from wine-making were investigated by research teams. Edible drinking straws, cups and plant pots partially made from potato pulp [left over after chips/readymeals are made], cookies and “rice-cream” made from rice bran (residues from rice-processing) and a biodegradable potato pulp packaging to replace single-use plastic wrapping were among the prototypes developed by researchers across European universities.

One research team grew duckweed in a tank from pig effluent with the view to creating an on-site food source for pigs. “This showed us how animal feed can be grown directly from waste on the same farm rather than spreading manure on the land to grow tillage crops or grass for animals,” Curran explains.

This research team focused on an area in the north-west of Germany where the manure from intensively reared pigs is currently transported 500km to a region in the east of Germany. If the pig farmers could grow duckweed in containers on their farms, this would give them food for their pigs and an on-site use for the pig effluent.

A research team in Nanjing Technical University, China, created microbial fuel cells in the laboratory with the view to scaling up the technology to make electricity to power sensors or LED lights at waste water or biogas facilities.

Each prototype in the AgroCycle project had to undergo a lifecycle assessment as part of the research brief to ensure there weren’t any social, economic or environmental costs if it was to be developed on a commercial basis. “The lifecycle assessment looks at the current use of the waste material, what it’s replacing if it was to be developed, the energy used in its production and any emissions from this process,” adds Dr Fionnuala Murphy, assistant professor in the School of Biosystems & Food Engineering at UCD, and coordinator of the MSc in sustainable energy and green technologies.

Curran says each prototype received positive results from the lifecycle assessments carried out. “It’s one thing to know that a product comes from a sustainable bio resource but it also has to be sustainable if used in a processing plant,” he says.

Ward believes there is great potential for agricultural and food-processing waste to be used in the production of bio-fertilisers as a viable replacement for expensive and environmentally-damaging mineral fertilisers.

“There is a producer in Monaghan making organic fertilisers for golf courses. Ireland is capable of producing more bio-fertilisers for the global market at a time when the EU is promoting organic fertilisers. The world is running out of mineral fertilisers and digestate [by-product of anaerobic digestors] already can be used as a bio-fertiliser at a local level,” Ward says.

Patrick Barrett, agricultural inspector in research at the Department of Agriculture, says projects like AgroCycle can demonstrate technologies linked to suitable biomass supply chains. “This will allow for regenerative agriculture and biodiversity preservation and the displacement of fossil-fuel-based inorganic fertilisers with organic fertilisers,” he says.

The development of a website, AgroCycle Marketplace, to connect farmers and food processors with potential users of their waste materials has been one of the most successful aspects of the project to date. “People from the biogas industry have told me that this is a long awaited solution which will allow waste producers to connect to the biogas industry across Europe. Feedstock is what’s needed by that industry,” Curran adds.

There are currently about 10 bioreactors in the Republic but the target is for 20 per cent of gas to be supplied by these bio-digesters by 2030. “Up to 20 per cent of what fruit and vegetable farmers produce is wasted and using this as a feedstock for biodigestors adds value to what can’t be sold for human consumption,” says Ciara Beausang, a UCD PhD researcher on the AgroCycle project.

AgroCycle researchers are currently working with Nova UCD to develop a business model for the AgroCycle Marketplace website. Similar discussions are taking place to look at the commercialisation of edible straws – the timing of which might be just right with the EU ban on single-use plastic items due in 2021 – see agrocycle.eu

Researchers at the Froebel Department of Primary and Early Childhood Education at Maynooth University have developed a free online educational website for use in primary schools. Through animated videos, rap songs, games and lots more, the site explores sustainable living, zero-waste ideas, climate, the bio-economy and the circular economy.

“Our resources are so timely, supporting primary school children, the leaders in the recent climate strikes in waking up the adults,” says project leader Dr Máire Nic an Bhaird.

AgroCycle Kids won first place in the Think Biobased Challenge European competition recently. The materials have been introduced in schools in Dublin, Wicklow, Galway and Beijing in China. They will be available to all primary schools throughout Europe and in China from September, 2019. More details athttp://kids.agrocycle-platform.com/",United States,2019.06
89,Circular Economy Part I: Planning ahead,"Harbour Times reporter Elise Mak travelled to Finland to explore how the country is adopting the concept of a circular economy and the lessons it holds for Hong Kong.

HELSINKI. Hong Kong is still working on promoting and fully adopting the 3Rs of waste – reducing, reusing and recycling – but Finland and other forward-looking countries have moved past that reactive stage to focus on adopting sustainability much earlier.

There are multiple lessons for Hong Kong in the circular economy concept that prevails in Finland. The key idea behind a circular economy is that resources are kept within the economy, even as products reach the end of their life. The goal is to design and manufacture products so that they can be used and reused and eventually recycled and brought back into the economy. The goal is to keep the cycle going for as long as possible.

To this end and whenever possible, products are repaired rather than replaced, parts are changed as needed. And, when products do hit the end of their useful lives, they are not sent to a landfill – as happens in Hong Kong – but separated into parts that can be reused and recycled.

This is the first of a multiple-part series focused on the lessons that Hong Kong, per capital one of the largest producers of garbage in the world, can learn from the one country that is leading the way towards adopting a circular economy.

Promoting such a holistic, sustainable economic system has been a key issue for the previous and current administrations in Finland.

Finland first used the term “circular economy” in its national development strategy in 2016 as it rolled out “Circle to the top: Finland’s road map to a circular economy 2016–2025“. It was the world’s first country to adopt a systematic plan to adopt circular economy concepts.

The strategy stresses material-efficient and low-carbon solutions. Finland focuses on five interlinked areas: a sustainable food system to produce food through wiser use of raw materials; forest-based loops to manufacture and add value to products; technical loops to minimize the use of virgin raw materials; transport and logistics to develop a smart system that uses fossil-free fuels; and joint actions by legislators, companies, universities and research institutes, consumers and citizens.

The 2016 road map was an effort by multiple stakeholders, including Finnish government ministries and around 50 representatives from across multiple sectors of the economy who were invited to open discussions and interviews.

“The road map process really expanded the scope of preparation in our ministry, which was far too focused on administration,” said Marja-Liisa Tapio-Biström of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forest.

This year, the road map was updated as “Finland’s road map to a circular economy 2.0”.

The new version of the plan stresses a shift to the use of low-carbon energy, considering natural resources as scarce and focusing on everyday decisions as the driving force for change.

The Nordic country aims to cut its carbon footprint in half from 2010 levels by 2030.

What Hong Kong can do

Finland is rich in forests. It actively promotes forest-based loops with the use of bio-based materials. This is an approach that may not necessarily work in Asian cities like Hong Kong with limited resources. They would have to design their own road maps to sustainable economic systems.

“One way to design this road map is to identify your own country and what is relevant in your own country. Identify the major industries in Hong Kong,” Ernesto Hartikainen, senior lead of carbon-neutral circular economy at independent think tank Sitra, told Harbour Times.“Then get the key stakeholders together from a couple of ministerial sectors. Not just the environmental ministry but also the finance ministry because there might be issues of taxation and subsidies.”

Hong Kong took a similar approach to considering the issue in 2013.

Hong Kong’s Environmental Protection Department rolled out the “Hong Kong: Blueprint for Sustainable Use of Resources 2013-2022”, which aimed at transforming the waste management structure by 2022 – with 55 percent of the waste going to recycling, 23 percent to incineration and 22 percent to the landfill.

Not much happened, at least not rapidly. Five years after the blueprint was developed, authorities finally tabled a bill to the Legislative Council (LegCo) for a mandatory waste charging scheme. Starting next year, residents will need to pay to buy designated plastic bags in which to for their trash at HK$0.11 per litre of trash.

By 2017, Hong Kong was producing 1.45 kg of solid municipal waste per person, a 20-year-high. the city’s 2013 plan had called for a reduction down to 1 kg per person by that year. Every day, Hong Kong sends 15,500 tonnes of waste to the city’s landfills.

By comparison, Finland’s output of municipal waste per capita has been dropping steadily. Of the 504 kg of municipal waste generated per capita in all of 2016, just 3 percent or 15.1 kg went to the landfill for the whole year. About 42 percent of the total output, almost 212 kg per person per year, were recycled.

The difference between how much Hong Kong sends to the landfills and what Finland sends is enormous. There are about 5.5 million people in Finland, which means that the country sends 1.166 million tonnes of waste to the landfills per year or about 3,194 tonnes per day, about a fifth as much as Hong Kong does.

Hong Kong authorities have declared their intent in mobilizing the community to recycle more with efforts such as collecting more glass bottles and bringing their own bags to supermarkets, as well as investing in organic waste treatment facilities, waste-to-energy municipal solid waste treatment and landfill extensions.

But these actions mainly look at how to deal with waste, instead of looking at the whole life cycle of the products which would go a long way towards reducing waste.

The Finnish believe materials are not lost at the end of their useful life but can be used to make new products over and over again – hence the effort to encourage sustainable design right from the conceptual stage.

A holistic economic model, as the Finns believe, should be about the use of services – sharing, renting and recycling – instead of owning things. The approach could go a long way towards reducing the output of garbage and the carbon footprint of countries around the world, not the least of them, Hong Kong.",United States,2019.06
90,Smart Cities New York Explores The Circular Economy,"At the recent Smart Cities Conference in NYC, individuals and organizations that are spearheading the Smart Cities movement discussed the circular economy. The circular economy aims to minimize waste and make the most of resources. In other words, the circular economy represents everything that your disposable coffee cup does not.

The individuals that led this conversation included Lindsay Clinton, the Senior VP of Industry Initiatives at the NYCEDC, and Michael Waas, Global VP of Brand Partnerships for TerraCycle. According to both Clinton and Waas, in order for the circular economy to work, there must be a mind shift and behavioral change, and TerraCycle does this by having elementary schools partake in its programs because the passion that young people have is very impactful.

Clinton points out that in NYC there are various initiatives to partake in the circular economy through Demonstration Projects like refashionNYC, which is in partnership with The Department of Sanitation.

Apartment buildings can set up “refashion bins” where tenants can throw old clothes or clothing items they no longer want. Many of the clothes in the refashion bins end up going to Goodwill or Housing Works, but in the case that some clothing items are not reusable they can be sent to different companies that transform and repurpose products for a new use.

Clinton finds herself working closely with cutting-edge incubators, and at Brooklyn Navy Yard there are many startups that are involved in the circular economy – like AlgiKnit, which turns kelp into wearable fiber. Additionally, Clinton mentioned teaming up with knowledge partners like the recently launched Connect Fashion, which leads an exploratory effort to provide digital IDs to clothing items so people can track the garment through its entire lifespan.

While initiatives to create momentum around the circular economy are just getting started here are some interesting, creative ideas that came up during this panel:

Loop Initiative – created by TerraCycle and it allows people to get their favorite products and goods in reusable packaging. You can buy products from your favorite brands (like Crest toothpaste and even Clorox wipes) and Loop will send you a tote with the products in state-of-the-art, reusable containers. Once users are done with the product, they put it back into the tote, schedule a free pick up, and get a refill. Think Modern Day Milkman.

Cigarette Butt Recycling Bins – once again created by TerraCycle, these recycling bins are not only put to good use, but they also reduce general litter up to 85-90% in the areas that they are deployed.",United States,2019.06
91,More US investment needed to achieve circular economy,"More investment in chemical recycling in the US would allow recycled material to return to the value chain at the same level from which it started, according to Wood Mackenzie Chemicals.

The US-based market analysts added that there needs to be multi-pronged investment efforts to improve comprehensive collection, sorting and recycle process technology to achieve a truly circular economy.

Wood Mackenzie Chemicals Research Analyst, Shruthi Vangipuram, said: ""The circular economy is now a buzzword driving public policy agendas and corporate strategy groups. With increased consumer awareness and the reality of more stringent political regulation around the corner, manufacturers, brands, and retailers are all pushing for innovation in recycled plastics. A number of large corporates have already made public commitments to diversify away from single-use plastics in the coming years.""

The polystyrene industry is relatively small at approximately 15 million tonnes (Mt) of consumption, compared to other polymers. Unlike polystyrene, polyethylene and polypropylene markets show robust growth rates of 3-4% per annum.

Vangipuram added: ""Historically, the issue with recycled products has been the fact they, more often than not, come back at a lower value … While chemical recycling has been suggested as a way to combat this issue, accessibility of such chemical technology is extremely limited and is still in its early stages.""

Investments in chemical recycling at the manufacturing level have been made, as has a joint venture between Americas Styrenics and Agilyx to recycle post-consumer polystyrene back to new polystyrene products at the same level from which they began. This effectively eliminates access to end-use markets as an obstacle and significantly expands the economic reach of recycling.

Further activity in the sector includes the deployment of depolymerisation technology.

“It’s encouraging to see investments taking place. However, in order to really transform the recycling industry, more funding will need to be concentrated into areas that help to develop chemical recycling technologies suitable for mass-adoption,” Vangipuram concluded.",United States,2019.06

95,Circular economy fits well with Qatar: Expert,"Circular economy, an emerging economic model most commonly referred to as ‘sustainable innovation’, fits well with high growth rate countries such as Qatar, said Nicola Tagliafierro (pictured), Head of Sustainable Product Development at Enel X.

Headquartered in Rome, Enel serves more than 72m customers in over 30 countries, and is a leading provider of energy management advisory and innovative and technological solutions for homes, companies, and smart cities.

According to Tagliafierro, who is responsible for the global Enel X sustainability strategies and an expert on circular economy, it’s now more important than ever that companies are taking the right decisions to support the environment and provide innovative solutions, which are keys for a successful business.

In an interview with The Peninsula, he said: “Nowadays, circular economy fits extremely well with high growth rate economies such as Qatar since it perfectly mixes economics and sustainability principles. To ensure the achievement of economic, social and environmental objectives set by the Qatar National Vision 2030 through circular economy business models, one of the key perimeters of action is cities. As estimated by the UN, 68 percent of the world population is expected to live in urban areas by 2050, and Qatar will be strongly impacted by this trend”.

Tagliafierro added: “Investing in ‘circular cities’ means promoting electric mobility and sustainable initiatives, such as smart lighting solutions, distributed renewable energy production systems and integrated smart plans for waste recovery, all combined with campaigns to raise awareness among citizens”.

Described by the World Economic Forum as one of the most significant business strategic models needed to meet environmental challenges, circular economy departs from the linear economy which is based on ‘take-make-dispose model’ currently used by most organizations. Circular economy aims to minimise waste and make the most of resources. It uses the ‘make-use-return model’ for an efficient reuse and recycling system.

With the growing demand for sustainable innovation, governments are also getting onboard with circular economy. The European Union (EU) has adopted an action plan in 2015 aiming to make supply chains more circular; from production to consumption, repair and manufacturing, and waste management. It is estimated that a shift toward the circular economy in the EU would increase GDP by an additional 12 percentage points by 2050.

In Qatar, the Qatar General Electricity and Water Corporation (Kahramaa) and Abdullah Bin Hamad Al Attiyah International Foundation for Energy and Sustainable Development (The Al Attiyah Foundation) signed an MoU in May to tackle circular economy.

In a report, The Al Attiyah Foundation has also said that Qatar provides a supportive environment to enable the private sector to launch initiatives that help promote long-term sustainable growth. The report added that companies, particularly energy companies, are also responding well to government efforts in public-private-partnership to adopt the circular economy model that would ensure that the four pillars of QNV 2030 will continue to be successfully addressed.

Tagliafierro added: “For circular economy to become a reality in Qatar, national goals should be translated into specific and targeted projects, through which circular economy business models and sustainable, innovative technologies are concretely tested and deployed. It would be beneficial to Qatar to promote innovation by attracting start-ups from all over the world through not just financial incentives, but also offering concrete opportunities to test the innovation in the field, involving both public administration and the private sector”.

He said that the benefits of circular economy will only be felt if it is implemented not just through a recycling or environmental programme, but as a mix of consumption models such as developing products as a service, extending product life, and using sustainable inputs to reduce energy consumption and save resources.",United States,2019.06

99,Southeast Asia should want the world’s junk. Recycling has to be a global effort,"Southeast Asian nations no longer want your trash. Last week, Malaysia announced it was sending 3,300 tons of scrap plastics including CDs, insulated electric cables and milk jugs back to countries ranging from Australia to Bangladesh, Canada, China, Japan and Saudi Arabia. Days later, the Philippines shipped back 69 containers of dirty Canadian diapers and other refuse brought into the country between 2013 and 2014.

It’s easy to see why: Smaller countries don’t want to become dumping grounds for trash that looks like it belongs in a hazardous-waste bin rather than a recycling facility. What’s ironic is that some of the countries forced to take back their scrap plastics don’t necessarily mind. In China, Japan and especially Europe, there’s growing momentum behind the idea that economies should strive to be more “circular” — in other words, that any waste they generate should be processed, recycled and reused at or close to home. Europe has set ambitious targets to achieve a continent-wide circular economy over the next three decades.

It’s an attractive idea. Unfortunately, it won’t work. A true circular economy can’t be national or even regional. It has to be global.
• It’s going to take ‘radical changes’ to improve Canada’s plastics recycling, report says
• Terence Corcoran: The best defence against plastic pollution that Catherine McKenna will hate
• McDonald’s commits to making recycling available at all locations by 2025

For the most part, that’s what the world had until quite recently. In the 19th century, an up-and-coming U.S. imported scrap clothing from Europe to feed its paper mills and scrap steel from the U.K. to help build its railways. After the Second World War, Japan and Taiwan rebuilt their economies by importing vast quantities of low-cost scrap metal and paper from around the world.

Beginning in the early 1980s, China surpassed all predecessors by becoming the world’s largest importer of recyclables. Everybody won. Countries that might otherwise have sent recyclables to a dump for lack of proper processing facilities found a huge customer willing to pay a premium for it. Meanwhile, China was able to integrate recyclables into its manufacturing supply chain on a mass scale. To take just one example, in 2016, China made as much as half of its copper from recycled resources, half of which were imported.

Of course, there were costs. Just as Chinese manufacturers often failed to meet the health and safety standards of developed countries, so did Chinese recyclers. Meanwhile, it proved cheaper to import recyclables — even the worst — from the developed world than to collect and manage China’s own waste. In January 2018, China severely restricted the import of scrap recyclables.

That decision has since warped the global recycling trade. Unscrupulous Chinese scrap importers quickly shifted operations to countries such as Malaysia, where they cut corners in recycling materials for export to factories back in China. Recent accounts of so-called “waste dumping” in Malaysia largely document these Chinese operations, not those of traditional Malaysian recyclers, who had previously generated few complaints.

The distinction is important. Restricting the global trade in recyclable plastics because of the actions of some bad actors won’t suddenly encourage rich nations to reuse more of their own trash. The manufacturers who need that recycled material will remain in the developing world, especially since consumption, too, is growing in those regions. Meanwhile, recycled raw materials generated in developed regions like Europe will be more expensive — and less competitive — than what developing countries can make at home (a problem familiar to manufacturers of finished goods).

Rather than trying to create closed recycling loops in each country or each region, environmental activists would do better to make the global recycling trade cleaner and more efficient. The first step is for the World Customs Organization to establish harmonized custom codes that accurately classify waste and recyclable raw materials. Currently, no such system exists, which allows importers to bring in low-quality recyclables that can only be processed using unsafe and environmentally unsound means.

Countries could also make the flow of recyclables smoother by lowering or eliminating tariffs on recyclable materials. These only raise the costs of recycling and incentivize smuggling.

Meanwhile, if activists in rich countries are concerned with the ability of poorer nations to recycle trash properly, they could do more to help them establish modern waste management systems. The U.S. government is taking small steps in this direction already and China, in particular, could be a leader in this effort. If it diverted a mere three per cent of all Belt and Road financing to establishing modern landfills and recycling facilities in recipient countries, it would expand the supply of sustainable raw materials while blunting the negative environmental consequences of letting poorer countries process imported trash.

The key to creating a truly circular economy isn’t to keep waste at home. It’s to make sure the world’s recyclables get processed — cleanly — where they’re needed most.

110,​Canada to host the 2020 World Circular Economy Forum,"Canadians know that we need to find new ways to reduce our waste and use our resources more efficiently. When we don't properly recycle and reuse materials, letting them become landfill instead, it is economic value we are throwing away. 



The Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Catherine McKenna, and the Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development, Navdeep Bains, have announced that Canada will host the 2020 World Circular Economy Forum (WCEF2020), in partnership with Finnish Innovation Fund, Sitra.

Canada has already started building a circular economy that benefits people, the economy and the environment. 

The WCEF2020 will be the first large-scale international event to bring circular economy leaders to North America. It will be an opportunity for Canada to showcase its talent on the world stage. Canadian innovators will work with international counterparts to find new opportunities and groundbreaking solutions that can transform would-be landfill into new products and new business opportunities. Working together, Canada and its partners will build strong, sustainable economies at home and abroad.

A circular economy moves away from a ""take, make and dispose"" way of doing business to one where goods are produced, distributed, and consumed in a way that retains the value of products and resources for as long as possible. Canadians are seizing the opportunity and new policies are beginning to support the circular economy, accelerating our transition.

At WCEF2020, Canada will bring together business and thought leaders from around the world, sharing ideas about how, together, innovative product design and business models will help us reuse and remanufacture materials, and create new economic opportunities, creating the clean jobs of the future.

111,3D Printing & the Circular Economy Part 2: Classical Manufacturing,"The traditional manufacturing industry paradigm that we are in today has its roots in various techniques and methods that are proven and have been in use for quite some time. With this though, there come some pros and cons. We are able to create items quickly and efficiently. These methods may not be the best though in terms of sustainability with products. Traditional manufacturing, although it has extreme efficiency, can be detrimental to various environmental resources. These larger scale manufacturing methods hurt the Earth as a whole and we should be more educated on these ramifications. It may even point to a larger issue referred to as global climate change. It also is not necessarily sustainable to operate with these tools due to the high setup costs they garner. There is also a need to keep a copious amount of material to conduct all of these processes. A manufacturer is also typically producing in bulk with these methods, so overproduction is a natural consequence. We will analyze waste and how large manufacturing may be able to change this with a shift toward newer methods such as additive manufacturing.

What is the typical and traditional manufacturing process? Typical manufacturing methods include the following:

In Injection Molding plastic pellets are pressed into a mold cavity and under pressure and heat become a certain shape. Injection molding produces low scrap rates relative to other traditional manufacturing processes like CNC machining which cut away substantial percentages of an original plastic block or sheet. This however can be a negative relative to additive manufacturing processes like 3D printing that have even lower scrap rates. Overall this is a method that does not produce a lot of scrap through initial production. The downsides that are associated with injection molding include high costs in terms of startup, molding, and tooling.

CNC Machining is a subtractive process. It will take a piece of material and cut out material from that item for usage. One can think of a wooden rectangular block for example. A CNC can then cut this into an intricate design. The issue then becomes how intricate of a design can work with CNC. CNC machines combine a motorized maneuverable tool and often a motorized maneuverable platform, which are both moved according to specific input instructions. Instructions are delivered to an NC machine in the form of graphical computer-aided design (CAD) files, which are transformed into a sequential program of machine control instructions such as G-code, and then executed.

Vacuum forming is a simplified version of thermoforming, where a sheet of plastic is heated to a forming temperature, stretched onto a single-surface mold, and forced against the mold by a vacuum. This process can be used to form plastic into permanent objects such as turnpike signs and protective covers. This is one of the oldest techniques for modern manufacturing. There is an ability to reuse a lot of the plastic that is used within these processes but this may not be the case.

Blow molding is a manufacturing process that is used to create hollow plastic parts (such as water bottles) by inflating a heated plastic tube until it fills a mold and forms the desired shape. The raw material in this process is a thermoplastic in the form of small pellets or granules, which is first melted and formed into a hollow tube, called the parison. Lastly, after the part has cooled, the mold halves are separated and the part is ejected. As the diameter of a mold increases, the corners and areas with the thinnest walls have close tolerance.This refers to how an object will have physical barriers in its material strength and geometry, thus having a threshold for firmness.

Milling is the process of machining using rotary cutters to remove material by advancing a cutter into a workpiece. This may be done varying direction on one or several axes, cutter head speed, and pressure. Milling covers a wide variety of different operations and machines, on scales from small individual parts to large, heavy-duty gang milling operations. It is one of the most commonly used processes for machining custom parts to precise tolerances. Milling can be done with a wide range of machine tools. The original class of machine tools for milling was the milling machine (often called a mill). After the advent of computer numerical control (CNC) in the 1960s, milling machines evolved into machining centers: milling machines augmented by automatic tool changers, tool magazines or carousels, CNC capability, coolant systems, and enclosures. Milling centers are generally classified as vertical machining centers (VMCs) or horizontal machining centers (HMCs). Milling machines tend to create a lot of metal debris and scraps after their use. This is another subtractive manufacturing process, so it is vital to contain and recycle all swarf or debris created from this process.

Stamping (also known as pressing) is the process of placing flat sheet metal in either blank or coil form into a stamping press where a tool and die surface forms the metal into a net shape. Stamping includes a variety of sheet-metal forming manufacturing processes, such as punching using a machine press or stamping press, blanking, embossing, bending, flanging, and coining. This could be a single stage operation where every stroke of the press produce the desired form on the sheet metal part, or could occur through a series of stages. The process is usually carried out on sheet metal, but can also be used on other materials, such as polystyrene. Progressive dies are commonly fed from a coil of steel, coil reel for unwinding of coil to a straightener to level the coil and then into a feeder which advances the material into the press and die at a predetermined feed length. Depending on part complexity, the number of stations in the die can be determined. Metal stamping companies can treat and recycle certain types of waste on-site.

Laser cutting is a technology that uses a laser to cut materials, and is typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, but is also starting to be used by schools, small businesses, and hobbyists. Laser cutting works by directing the output of a high-power laser most commonly through optics. The [laser optics] and CNC (computer numerical control) are used to direct the material or the laser beam generated. A commercial laser for cutting materials involved a motion control system to follow a CNC or G-code of the pattern to be cut into the material. The focused laser beam is directed at the material, which then either melts, burns, vaporizes away, or is blown away by a jet of gas, leaving an edge with a high-quality surface finish. Industrial laser cutters are used to cut flat-sheet material as well as structural and piping materials. Laser cutters have the same concerns of waste generation with other CNC machines as they are using a subtractive method.

A water jet cutter, also known as a water jet or waterjet, is an industrial tool capable of cutting a wide variety of materials using a high-pressure jet of water, or a mixture of water and an abrasive substance. The term abrasive jet refers specifically to the use of a mixture of water and abrasive to cut hard materials such as metal or granite, while the terms pure waterjet and water-only cutting refer to waterjet cutting without the use of added abrasives, often used for softer materials such as wood or rubber. Waterjet cutting is often used during fabrication of machine parts. It is the preferred method when the materials being cut are sensitive to the high temperatures generated by other methods. Waterjet cutting is used in various industries, including mining and aerospace, for cutting, shaping, and reaming.

Additive manufacturing or 3D printing differs from most of those methods due to it being a process that builds upwards. Another major functional difference between additive and traditional manufacturing methods is the fact that additive manufacturing involves far less material waste. We effectively render a material waste byproduct when removing it in a subtractive manufacturing process. Additive manufacturing only uses the material necessary to create a part, ensuring that waste is very minimal. Parts that require support structures for printing, however, will still involve an amount of wasted material.

Further advantages are the capability to optimise geometries and create light-weight components that reduce material consumption in manufacturing and energy consumption in use; the subsequent reduction in transportation in the supply chain; and inventory waste reduction due to the ability to create spare parts on-demand. Overall AM is expected to become a key manufacturing technology in the sustainable society of the future. Much of this material cannot be recycled especially if it concerns photopolymers which are thermosets. Other thermoplastics can be recycled but this is usually done much lower down the value stream and may consume a similar level of energy to manufacture the original material.

As a whole this article briefly introduces the differences between other methods of manufacturing. Although some methods are necessary, additive manufacturing seems to be on the right path in terms of sustainability versus other traditional methods previously explained. In the next article in this series, we will explore some of these different machining techniques and compare them to additive manufacturing in terms of sustainability.",United States,2019.06

113,Turning trash into cash,"Adam Pitt reports on how Charlotte is embracing the circular economy

Charlotte is vying to become the first city in the US to implement a new circular economy model that has been designed to turn waste into an US$111-million business opportunity.

Launched last year under the banner of the Circular Charlotte initiative, the model is based on the findings of a report commissioned by the city council entitled Circular Charlotte: Toward a Zero Waste and Inclusive City. The report recommends that a comprehensive waste diversion strategy be developed after data showed that only 11.5 percent of materials in the waste stream were being recycled or reused.

Six months on, and the municipal government is ploughing ahead with plans to open an ‘Innovation Barn’ that it wants to turn into a gathering place for small businesses and budding entrepreneurs. Located on the site of a former horse stable in Belmont, the 3,500-square-metre renovated barn represents the first phase of Circular Charlotte, which aims to redirect waste, create new economies, and ultimately reduce the amount of public money being spent on annual waste management fees.

According to data shared with Cities Today, the cost of collecting, recycling, and disposing of solid waste currently stands at US$52.2 million, with nearly a quarter of that figure consumed by landfill fees. By comparison, the city council anticipates investing just US$2 million into the barn.

The experimental barn is being created with non-profit organisation Envision Charlotte, a team of consultants at Metabolic in the Netherlands, and architecture and design company Progressive AE. The barn will include co-working spaces for upcycling and recycling, a composting enclosure, and an aquaponic garden stocked with plants and catfish. There will also be a beer garden and a zero-waste restaurant to create touch points for the community.

“One of the things we’re trying to do through the barn is provide examples of ‘closed loop’ systems, from aquaponic gardens to hydroponic gardens,” explains Amy Aussieker, Executive Director at Envision Charlotte. “We’re also trying to get people to come here so we can educate them to think differently about the materials that are in our waste system and how they can be reused. They might not care about an aquaponic garden. They might just want to drink beer, but get here and see something new.”

With more than 30 local craft breweries in Charlotte, the inclusion of a beer garden is likely to be a popular tool in the city’s efforts to promote the circular economy. Another partner that could prove valuable in reaching a younger audience is Trips for Kids. Through its free earn-a-bike and ride programme, the charity teaches children from at-risk environments aged nine to 15 to ride, maintain and repair bikes safely. Once students graduate, they earn a free bike, lights, helmet, and lock.

“We need to change the mentality in the US,” says Aussieker. “[We are not just] talking about the circular economy like the EU or other countries, we see this as an opportunity to be a leader.”

Although he acknowledges the link between budget savings and the ability to maintain low taxes, Marcus Jones, City Manager for the City of Charlotte, says cities must stop focusing on cost-cutting alone if they wish to be successful in developing a circular economy.

“One of the big problems cities across the country are facing is the cost of municipal services that collect and transport solid waste, and the [costs associated with putting it into landfill],” he says. “Many cities are asking how they can reduce these costs, but we are saying you can take your trash and turn it into cash–it’s a very different prospect. It’s more than recycling, it’s about reuse.”

Jones, who has the full backing of his peers on the council, says access to data has been crucial in ensuring Charlotte’s quest doesn’t have to become a zero-sum trade-off between the perceived costs and benefits of investing in circular economy projects.

Data has helped Charlotte to understand the waste stream and the potential for diversion from landfill to create economic and upward mobility opportunities for jurisdictions.

“Are we starting by saying we’re going to have zero waste? Absolutely not,” he says. “That may be a vision for down the road, but right now we have to find out ways to get people involved, to get people at aware that reuse is a good thing for our environment, for job creation, and for revenue streams that can come into the city and to help to keep taxes down while promoting innovation and creativity.”

Critics of the circular economy argue that more efficient use of resources could drive down the cost of manufacturing and increase demand, but Jones says the aim is to identify microeconomies and then see which materials have the most value. Only then will large-scale projects be considered.

The city has not created any specific policies to govern the circular economy, meaning that any guidance offered to other cities is likely to be limited to experiential learning–at least for now–as Aussieker explains.

“One of the interesting things about Charlotte is that if [we] pass a policy [it can] can be overridden [by the state government], so we tend to stay away from policies,” she says. “That’s why we commissioned the study to look at what Charlotte has and how we can use it to create jobs and [a return on investment].”

Nevertheless, with Charlotte’s food waste now earmarked as a resource for black soldier fly larvae to convert into poultry farm feed, and demolished concrete and glass powder set to be reused in new concrete, the city’s learnings may still prove valuable enough for other cities to consider investing.

And, while Charlotte is currently committed to making better use of its waste, Circular Charlotte includes provisions for initiatives aimed at creating closed-loop systems in energy, air, and water.

“[Microeconomies are] absolutely [the focus, and] if we are [building a circular economy] here in Charlotte, we will attract different innovative and creative people who will come here and help us solve the [sustainability] problems,” says Jones. “Other cities may also come to us for guidance about zero-waste and say: ‘I have an issue with my recycling because China is no longer taking my waste–what is Charlotte doing that’s different, that I can bring it back to my city and apply it?'”",United States,2019.06
122,AIPIA: On how technology can move us closer to a Circular Economy,"Ferrante interviewed Larry Logan, 'chief evangelist', Digimarc, on the first day of the AIPSA (Active Intelligent packaging Summit Americas) in New Jersey, US (June 3-4) about completing a three-year project with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s New Plastics Economy, using digital watermarking to reduce plastic waste in the environment.

“Digimarc Barcode is unique because it creates ‘intelligent objects’ that provide ‘hyper sorting’ in recycling facilities​,” said Logan.

“The HolyGrail test results demonstrate a viable path towards much greater plastics recycling, leading to reduced waste, and validates our engagement with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s New Plastics Economy​ Global Commitment. It’s gratifying to see how these capabilities can be readily applied for social good in support of a Circular Economy for plastics​.”

The HolyGrail Pioneer Project was a collaboration led by Procter & Gamble with 29 participating partners, including consumer L’Oreal, Danone, Nestlé, PepsiCo, Henkel and retailer Carrefour.

In a published report​, tests show Digimarc Barcode, by turning plastic containers into “intelligent objects,” could accomplish sorting techniques that have been impossible for the industry to achieve.

By accurately distinguishing between food-grade versus non-food grade containers, Digimarc Barcode addresses a previously unmet challenge, and could have a major impact on developments in recycling in the near future.

In also identifies flexible packaging, carbon-black packaging, the composition of plastic types in multi-layers and detects the proper separation and sorting of full-body shrink-sleeved containers.

The way the Digimarc Barcode works is via a scannable 3D identity when applied in plastic substrates.

The dataset carried by the code can convey a range of attributes, including the waste item’s manufacturer, product SKU, and manufacturing facility.

The barcode automatically instructs sorting mechanisms to separate the plastic waste for higher quality and quantity of recyclable materials, to ensure manufacturers can meet their public commitments for use of recycled content and to comply with government mandates.

Digimarc Barcode can also be applied to shrink sleeves and paper labels providing opportunities for increasing the likelihood of identification and the amount of data that can be obtained.

The Global Commitment aims to build a Circular Economy for plastics by bringing together key stakeholders to rethink and redesign the future of plastics, which Digimarc signed in April 2019.",United States,2019.06

127,Canada to host the 2020 World Circular Economy Forum,"OTTAWA, June 4, 2019 /CNW/ - Canadians know that we need to find new ways to reduce our waste and use our resources more efficiently. When we don't properly recycle and reuse materials, letting them become landfill instead, it is economic value we are throwing away.

The Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Catherine McKenna, and the Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development, Navdeep Bains, today announced that Canada will host the 2020 World Circular Economy Forum (WCEF2020), in partnership with Finnish Innovation Fund, Sitra. Canada has already started building a circular economy that benefits people, the economy and the environment.

The WCEF2020 will be the first large-scale international event to bring circular economy leaders to North America. It will be an opportunity for Canada to showcase its talent on the world stage. Canadian innovators will work with international counterparts to find new opportunities and groundbreaking solutions that can transform would-be landfill into new products and new business opportunities. Working together, Canada and its partners will build strong, sustainable economies at home and abroad.

A circular economy moves away from a ""take, make and dispose"" way of doing business to one where goods are produced, distributed, and consumed in a way that retains the value of products and resources for as long as possible. Canadians are seizing the opportunity and new policies are beginning to support the circular economy, accelerating our transition.

At WCEF2020, Canada will bring together business and thought leaders from around the world, sharing ideas about how, together, innovative product design and business models will help us reuse and remanufacture materials, and create new economic opportunities, creating the clean jobs of the future.

""Canadians know we have too much waste—it's piling up in landfills, and ending up in our environment. By working together, we can find ways to recycle and reuse our resources. Canada is looking forward to welcoming WCEF2020 delegates to North America, to expand circular economy networks, partnerships and opportunities. Let's work together and turn that trash to cash.""

– Catherine McKenna, Minister of Environment and Climate Change

""We want to leave a strong economy and a clean environment for our children. Canadian companies are at the forefront of clean technology globally and many of our homegrown innovations involve zero waste. Cleantech and zero waste are the next wave of innovation, supporting our economy and creating good jobs, while protecting our environment.""

131,Sustainable: Minneapolis tapped for ‘circularity’ conference,"The “circular” economy is a pretty simple idea. Waste not, want not. By reducing water use and waste, creating products that last longer, consuming less energy and supporting renewables, businesses will have healthier bottom lines along with happier employees and customers.

The circular economy concept has been around for years, especially in Europe, where nonprofit organizations have encouraged better design that eliminates pointless packaging and encourages the manufacturer of products that last. In the United States, the Twin Cities area has emerged as a national leader in the circular economy movement through the Environmental Initiative’s Minnesota Sustainable Growth Coalition.

The coalition is one of the reasons GreenBiz, a media and events company that focuses on green business practices, selected Minneapolis as the site of its first major conference on the topic. Being held June 18-20 at the Minneapolis Marriott, Circularity 19 will bring together as many as 750 thought leaders on the circular economy, including sustainability leaders from Apple, Google, Lockheed Martin, Ikea, Land O’ Lakes, Ecolab and dozens of other companies.

“The Growth Coalition is a big reason why we’re having it in Minneapolis,” said Lauren Phipps, director and senior analyst of Circular Economy for the Oakland-based GreenBiz Group Inc. “The Environmental Initiative told us, ‘We already have this group around sustainability and all this internal buy-in already.’ The Twin Cities is the perfect place to launch the conference because there’s already interest in the circular economy.”

GreenBiz has been tracking sustainability, but it was a “leap of faith” to devote a conference to it. The Minneapolis event will be the first time the company has ever sold out a “launch conference” covering a new issue, she said.

Circularity focuses on designing out waste and pollution in products and assisting with the regeneration of natural systems, Phipps said. The conference looks to cover everything involved in every aspect of the business cycle and how it relates to circularity — business strategy and innovation, logistics and infrastructure, design and materials, food and water systems, next-generation packaging standards and metrics.

One example Phipps shared is Apple’s goal of making future products out of recycled and renewable materials instead those that have been extracted through mining. The project, which has no timeline, will require Apple to design in new ways and set policies on how clients return used technology for recycling.

Companies wanting to change systems to reduce waste and reuse materials will have to consider financial implications and rethink supply chains. It’s never easy to transform the old way of doing business to a new one, and conference participants will speak to those issues, she said.

An update on the Minnesota coalition

Finance & Commerce covered the coalition in 2017, but there have been a few significant changes and advancements. Amy Fredregill joined as managing director last year. She is a veteran of environmental and clean energy initiatives, most recently at Xcel Energy and before that at Midwest Renewable Energy Tracking System, where she helped establish the nonprofit.

Coalition members are creating business cases for clean energy, waters and materials. The first to finish, the clean energy vision, calls for a more ambitious target than the state’s goal of reducing greenhouse gases by 30 percent by 2025 and 80 percent by 2050.

Part of the strategy calls for increasing access to clean energy to “improve racial, economic, social and public health outcomes,” according to a coalition statement.

This will be achieved by energy efficiency, conservation, improving Minnesota’s energy infrastructure, electrification and greenhouse gas capture. “Our energy vision is important and it’s ambitious,” Fredregill said. “We’re also seeing that equity and access are at the top row of the vision. It’s the underpinning for a lot of the work we’ve been doing.”

Next up are a “materials” statement that calls for the Twin Cities to exceed its goal of diverting 75 percent of waste from landfills. It’s still a work in progress but the goal starts with improved product design and then moves through other processes to reduce waste.

Companies participate in the coalition for different reasons. Aveda, one of the founding members and a longtime advocate for sustainability, sees the coalition as a vehicle for moving the region forward. “We wanted to work in collaboration with all the other companies because we can do more together than we can do separately,” said global sustainability manager Dan Schibel.

The coalition provides an opportunity for businesses to support state legislation and policies as a collective body rather than as individual companies, he said. Schibel and another coalition member, Rusty Callier of Apple Valley-based Uponor North America, spoke to two state commissioners earlier this year about workplace charging for electric vehicles and clean energy.

“It’s easier to talk as a group to government officials,” said Callier, Uponor’s director of corporate responsibility and sustainability.

He added that being a coalition member offers the opportunity to hear from much larger companies about how they handle environmental issues.

The coalition might someday come together to incentivize employees to buy electric vehicles, Schibel suggested, or collaborate on other initiatives. Currently a group of midlevel sustainability practitioners in the coalition trade information and ideas informally. Schibel has recently looked for how to recycle package labels. “It’s a community where people want to learn from one another and use practices to improve sustainability,” he said.

Involvement in the coalition can also help companies engage and retain employees. When prospective employees hear about Uponor, they may have little idea that company supplies plumbing equipment. Yet when they hear about Uponor’s commitment to decarbonization strategies and support for clean energy at the state level, they become more engaged. Employees are searching for “a purpose-driven approach to business,” Callier said.

Although working within the coalition on collective priorities is an attraction, many member companies pursue their own sustainability initiatives. Coalition members had considered a joint effort to buy renewable energy, but Xcel Energy’s Renewable Connect program gave them a simpler way to do it separately.

Earlier this year, 3M announced a goal of running operations on renewable energy, beginning with its corporate headquarters in Maplewood, through a Renewable Connect subscription. Uponor buys energy through Renewable Connect and has plans to subscribe to a new version of the program in pursuit of reaching 100 percent renewable energy, Callier said. Meanwhile, Golden Valley-based General Mills announced the purchase of enough wind power to offset the electricity it will use for the next 15 years.

Fredregill sees the Twin Cities as leading a new era of sustainability. “This will brand the region and make us more competitive,” she said. “The circulatory conference chose to start a new conference series here because we have so much leadership here.”

133,Policy Brief: Monthly Forecast June 2019: From Beating Plastic Pollution to Circular Economy and Healthy Lives | SDG Knowledge Hub | IISD,"June 2019 begins and ends with issues where the environment and the economy intersect.

Experts at the 2019 World Circular Economy Forum in Helsinki this week made the case that we can “meet the needs of all within the means of the planet” by shifting from a “take-make-waste” economic model to a circular one. The results, participants pointed out, are not just environmental benefits but a “transition to healthy, resilient cities with a good life for all.”

With waste so often incinerated, or disposed of into the air, circular economy conversations are linked closely to the theme of this year’s World Environment Day (5 June) – ‘Beat Air Pollution.’ The theme follows on last year’s UN-led push to “beat plastic pollution,” which propelled the issue to the forefront of many high-level discussions. Plastic pollution was the central focus of the ‘Play it Out’ Concert in Antigua on 1 June, organized by the UNGA President, who also announced a ban on single-use plastics at UN headquarters in New York, US beginning on 3 June 2019.

The 56th meeting of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Council will take up waste issues during its consultation with civil society organizations (CSOs) next week. A dialogue on plastic pollution will highlight practical experiences and lessons learned with regard to the production, consumption and waste management of plastics.

Looking further ahead, the air pollution focus of World Environment Day pulls together climate change, energy usage and health concerns, all of which will be linked together again in the course of the high-level week at the UN General Assembly in September 2019. Preparations for this week will be in full swing in mid-June, as governments continue their negotiations on many of the issues in focus during the “week of summits” in September 2019, including the SDG Summit, the Samoa Pathway mid-term review, a high-level meeting on universal health care, and others. These meetings will convene in the same week as the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, which seeks to set a new bar for ambition at UN meetings and fast-forward delivery of climate commitments around the world.

Another key event in June related to the week of summits is the election of the UNGA President of the 74th session (2019-2020): Permanent Representative of Nigeria to the UN, Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, was elected on 4 June. He has promised a focus on implementing SDGs 1 (no poverty), 2 (zero hunger) and 4 (quality education), and highlighted inclusion, especially of women and youth, and incorporating human rights into the UN’s work. In addition to presiding over a “week-long world gathering to drive results,” Tijani will oversee an entire year expected to focus on boosting ambition, action and delivery for a wide range of global commitments, and strengthening multilateralism, in the leadup to the UN’s 75th anniversary in 2020.

Also in June, the Bonn Climate Change Conference is expected to give greater visibility to its work with other international organizations in light of “intense activity on climate change in the wider UN system.” A high-level stocktaking meeting in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), will hold roundtable discussions on ways to raise ambition, enhance Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and accelerate energy transition. The event will include a meeting of climate and health ministers, acknowledging the climate-health nexus and seeking to identify ways to “avoid billions of dollars in human health costs.” The stocktaking meeting is part of the preparations for the Climate Action Summit in September.

At the end of the month, Japan will hold the G20 Summit in Osaka. Bringing the month full circle, an agreement on reducing plastic pollution of the ocean is reported as a hoped-for outcome from this Group that sets the tone for the direction that the global economy will take.

teams will be reporting from many of these events as well as other prominent meetings, including the UN Open-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea, the ninth meeting of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGR) Working Group to Enhance the Functioning of the Multilateral System (MLS), and the ongoing annual general meeting of the China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development (CCICED).

139,15 Inspiring Quotes About Circular Fashion and the Circular Economy,"As the world starts to move away from the linear production method of ‘take, make and waste’ to circularity in which waste is seen as a design flaw, we’ve put together this list of inspiring quotes and words about circular fashion and the circular economy that we feel should be shared far and wide to motivate people to view materials in a doughnut shaped kind of way!

As I made mention in our first post about sustainability quotes, to the untrained mind, some of the quotes may seem unrelated to the topic at hand, but when you view the broader picture you will begin to see the quote’s relevance.

I really hope these quotes help motivate you to take action to reduce waste and see resources and materials in a new light, something that should be reused and recycled rather than dumped and wasted. Enjoy the quotes!

1. If it can’t be reduced, repaired, rebuilt, refurbished, refinished, resold, recycled or composted, then it should be restricted, redesigned or removed from production. – Peter Seeger

2. Once you understand the destruction taking place, unless you do something to change it, even if you never intended to cause such destruction, you become involved in a strategy of tragedy. You can continue to be engaged in that strategy of tragedy, or you can design and implement a strategy of change. – Michael Braungart, Willian McDonough, Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things

3. So-called ‘circular’ approaches – to the city, the economy, design – extend well beyond just limiting environmental impacts. They take on a more systemic, cyclical view of how physical and biological processes, together with human interactions, give rise to sustainable living environments – forming a complete self-sustaining ‘ecosystem’, like a closed circle.? Michiel Schwarz, A Sustainist Lexicon

5. Anyone who believes in indefinite growth on a physically finite planet is either mad, or an economist. – Sir David Attenborough

6. An economy that puts back what it takes out, that is sustainable by design. – Matthew Bishop, Economics: An A-Z Guide

7. There is no such thing as ‘away’. When we throw anything away it must go somewhere. – Annie Leonard

8. For the twenty-first century a far bigger goal is needed: meeting the human rights of every person within the means of our life-giving planet. – Kate Raworth, Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st-Century Economist

9. In nature nothing is created and nothing is destroyed, but everything is transformed. – Antoine Laurent Delavosier

10. Problems cannot be solved at the same level of awareness that created them. – Albert Einstein

11. It’s pretty amazing that our society has reached a point where the effort necessary to extract oil from the ground, ship it to a refinery, turn it into plastic, shape it appropriately, truck it to a store, buy it and bring it home, is considered to be less effort than what it takes to just wash the spoon when you’re done with it. – Author unknown

12. Cradle to Cradle is like good gardening; it is not about “saving” the planet but about learning to thrive on it – Michael Braungart, Willian McDonough, Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things



13. In its industrial processes, a truly circular economy creates no net pollution or waste. – Matthew Bishop, Economics: An A-Z Guide

14. Waste isn’t waste until we waste it. — Will.I.Am, musician

15. The challenge now is to create economies – local to global – that help to bring all of humanity into the Doughnut’s safe and just space. Instead of pursuing ever-increasing GDP, it is time to discover how to thrive in balance. – Kate Raworth, Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st-Century Economist

142,Full circle: how to drive up profits by going green,"Alan O'Neill, author of Premium is the New Black is Managing Director of Kara Change Management, specialists in strategy, culture and people development. Go to kara.ie

I remember driving to Dunsink dump in north Co Dublin many years ago. The car was loaded with junk, which included an old fridge, broken furniture and other household waste.

Having paid our fee at the gate, we drove to the top of a hill and literally unloaded the rubbish and watched it rolling down the hill. Down below there were people, animals and birds scavenging for the scraps. There was also a bulldozer turning over the soil and burying the waste. And, in our culture at that time, we thought that was okay.

Apart from returning glass bottles to the milkman, that was an age when the linear economy was the main game in town. Goods were manufactured for consumption - with no end-of-life consideration whatsoever for the various components and packaging that was required to market and sell such products. We already know about the negative impact of waste on the environment. You too will have seen the videos of the 'plastic oceans' and the whales with bellies full of waste.

But recycling is not just good for the planet. It's also a potentially profitable business. Food, mobility, and household goods make up about 60pc of European household income. Their components are all dependent on commodity markets where pricing is becoming more volatile and scarcity a growing issue. There is an alternative that is good for our conscience and is also good for business. It's the circular economy.

The German division of pay-TV broadcaster Sky set out in 2014 to redesign its set-top TV box. Its aim was to enhance the customer experience, improve operational efficiency and respect the environment.

""The typical set-top box lasted seven years or more. In that time, a customer's needs for TV service might change and a box's specifications can fall behind the requirements of our service,"" said Sebastian Hauptmann, Sky Deutschland's executive vice president of operations to McKinsey's Eric Hannon.

""Or if something goes wrong with the box, the customer has to send it back, which interrupts viewing. We felt we could manage the boxes in a better way for customers"" .

They changed their returns process, so that used accessories such as remote controls, cables, and power-supply units could be recovered and refurbished for reuse. When a customer sent back a set-top box with a problem, they would replace the faulty component with a refurbished one.

They also found that they could lower the costs of repairs and give subscribers a better experience by switching to modular hard drives. Customers can now disconnect the hard drive from the box when something goes wrong and can retain it with all of their recorded programmes. If the hard drive itself fails, the customers can send it back while keeping the set-top box so they can continue to receive live TV service.

After they saw the benefits of decoupling the hard drive from the main unit, they applied the same logic to the entire design. The easier they made it to fix or replace just the faulty parts, the more they could save by keeping functional parts in service. Extending the life of the box lowered the total cost of ownership. That's when they started thinking of the set-top box as a circular product. And that's when they realised that recovering, reusing and recycling was profitable.

Tips for Engaging with the Circular Economy

Recycling used to be seen as an added cost. I believe that with the right culture, organisations can improve margin, enhance the customer experience and help the environment in the new circular economy. You too could potentially improve your margin by engaging with it. Take your 'new product development' (NPD) process as an example.

Kill several birds with one stone. You'll help mankind, make your team feel good and you'll improve margin. Set challenges for your NPD team that demand appropriate consideration be given to the circular economy.

2 Broaden the NPD team beyond marketing and manufacturing departments

Include your logistics and ICT teams so that all touch-points in the overall process are considered. Rather than see your process as a linear value chain, see it as a circular one. At the planning stage, consider recovering, reusing, and recycling of all components. Also consider the disposal of waste.

3 Consider including customers in some parts of this process

Doing so means that they will add a different perspective.

Use this or some other creative process to help you think outside the box.

Producers of electrical and electronic goods now must implement EU regulations on the recycling of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE Directive). The European Recycling Platform (ERP) was founded in 2002 as the first pan-European organisation and is Ireland's only pan-European compliance scheme, providing WEEE and waste battery compliance and a B2B service to members.

""We now manage a consolidated network and have developed vast international expertise, expanding our recycling services to include batteries as well as packaging"" said ERP chief executive Martin Tobin. ERP is sponsoring The Green Alley Award, Europe's first startup prize for the circular economy.

It's looking for the next generation of sustainable business ideas.

""We are looking for Irish startups that are about to launch new products or services, or are already in the growth phase, to enter. We are also welcoming startups that want to expand into other European markets"" said Martin.

The sole condition is that the business idea must help recycle resources and help reduce waste. The winner of the Green Alley Awards receives a cash prize of €25,000. Check out green-alley-award.com",United States,2019.06

145,Nuts for crickets: The Cricket Bakery aims to make insect protein mainstream by upping ease of use,"With consumer interest in sustainable protein sources and the ability to trace where food is from, The Cricket Bakery founder and CEO Ruth Galloway believes that insect protein, starting with crickets, is the way forward.

“Cricket consumption has a very low carbon footprint - they use very little resources, very little water, and very little feed. As a matter of fact, our crickets are all fed on fruit and vegetable waste that was supposed to go to landfill, so it’s sort of [a circular economy],” ​she told FoodNavigator-Asia​ at the Naturally Good Expo 2019 in Sydney.

“We believe that in order to change consumer perception of eating insects, it must first be easy to use them, which is why instead of selling cricket flour like most others do, we have used this as a base to manufacture our baking blends.”​

The Cricket Bakery has several baking blends available including for bread, banana bread and pancakes. All its crickets are sourced locally in Australia.

“We started with the sweeter goods first, and are now expanding into the savoury product space, into things like falafel mix and burger mix, where the cricket protein will replace the patty,”​ added Galloway.

She also highlighted that cricket protein consumption brings with it many health benefits.

“Crickets are a complete protein that can provide all the nine essential amino acids. It is also high in Vitamin B12, which makes it very popular with vegans and vegetarians who chose the lifestyle for ethical purposes, plus it contains high levels of calcium, iron, omega-3 and gives lots of prebiotic fibre.”​

The Cricket Bakery products are currently available in New South Wales, Melbourne and Perth, but are looking to grow much further.

“We first want to secure our New South Wales and nationwide distribution, but definitely also are interested in the United States market and Asian markets like Singapore where there are lots of curious foodies,”​ said Galloway.

In order to do that, the company is focusing very much on education, to reduce the confusion surrounding the category, as well as increase consumer knowledge on how to use the products.

“Education has been one of our biggest challenges, and we are doing this in a four-pronged approach. We want to teach people about the insects themselves, about the health benefits, the sustainability aspect, and definitely the ease of use,” ​explained Galloway.

Some of the consumers most likely to embrace cricket baked goods were those with strong ethical and sustainability awareness, as well as those with health concerns, added Galloway

“The products are also gluten-free, dairy-free and GMO-free,”​ she said.

As such, she opined that as consumer awareness of sustainability and ethical issues grows, so will the market for insect protein.

“Many people are already aware of the state the environment is in and that we cannot continue this way, so are becoming more accepting of alternative sources of food like insect protein. Not only that, the fact that these products are so nutrient dense will certainly be a plus point.”​

Moving forward, the dream for The Cricket Bakery is to own its own manufacturing plant.

“We’re mostly packing manually by hand now, but as demand grows via our efforts to grow nationwide, the hope is that we can eventually move into having our own manufacturing facility,”​ said Galloway.",United States,2019.06
146,River Mithi rejuvenation: Eight tonnes of trash collected along stretches | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Under a searing 37 degree sky, over 75 volunteers, independent and attached to various voluntary groups, picked away tiny fragments of old plastic trash along with bulky matters along stretches of the 17.2km long parched Mithi river on Sunday morning.City advocate Afroz Shah who in October 2015 set into motion, what was to soon become the world’s largest, most inspirational marine litter cleanups, had invigorated many to go beyond their weekend leisure plans and devote few hours to try and make Mumbai beautiful again. “We are focusing on the first 1.3km of the river,"" said Shah. The river was so filthy it was called an open drain. The cleaning has already made a huge difference in a span of 28 weekends.“We collected almost eight tonnes of trash,"" said QHSE auditor Rohan Kotwalkar and advocate Pragati Shirke who along with a dentist Jaya Rathore, actor Amit Kumar and Ranveer Kashyap, Versova locals Chandrakant Bibwe and Salman Khan are the regulars. There were volunteers, new and old from India and abroad. Dr Lalita Ram and Neeta Bhalla from AGNI joined in for the first time. The lot, later went into narrow slum lanes of Filter pada on the river bank, training citizens to adopt “circular economy,"" a concept which they hope will reach every household. There are 2 million people living in shanties lining the river. “We want them to care too about its future, their future. The problems of plastic pollution on the banks of river Mithi is essentially a socio-economic problem,"" said Shah adding “Mithi rejuvenation is a three pronged approach to solid waste management, liquid waste management and training people living on the banks to adopt circular economy.""Local corporators Manish Nair and Chandrawati Jagtap work hard every weekend too.Till date 60 tractor loads or 2,40,000 kgs of plastic and related trash has been fished out and taken out, said Shah, who is India’s first and only UN Environment Champion. It includes the problematic water hyacinths.Egrets swoosh up over the heads of little children who watch from atop the riverbank wall, and ‘monitor’ the cleaning with delighted squeals of “Uncle, I can spot some plastic there,"" pointing with grubby fingers. The relentless heat quietens the early morning enthusiastic chatter among volunteers who having filled in bins, carry it to a waiting tractor. They trudge back to the exit through the slums, where life is waking up, people still have water cans—cut from plastic oil cans-- in their hands, to get their morning ablutions done, some are fresh out of shower, drying their hair, TV sets are already on, set to their favourite soaps, elsewhere domestic helps are scrubbing dishes outside under a civic tap. “Will remember to collect and keep the plastic trash for collection next week,"" says one housewife, flashing a sheepish grin. The mercury was already high, the volunteers keep their cool and call it a day at 10.30am, to be back next Sunday.Meanwhile in a separate drive on June 1, another cleanup effort was kicked off ahead of the forthcoming Environment Day with Mumbai’s targeted beaches and rivers being rid of 16,000 kgs of plastic trash. The plastic waste collected as part of the clean coasts drive is to be recycled and converted into new usable products by PepsiCo India which is partnered with Project Mumbai, a not-for-profit organisation, to participate in “Jallosh- Clean Coasts”.

149,Plastics bill moves forward in Sacramento,"A bill to phase out single-use plastics by 2030 passed Wednesday in the state senate and its companion bill passed Thursday in the state assembly.

Sen. Ben Allen, who represents the Westside, Hollywood and the South Bay in the California State Senate, introduced legislation in February requiring all single-use packaging and products to be reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2030. Senate Bill 54 would also require California to recycle or divert 75 percent of single-use materials. The state currently recycles just 15 percent of single-use plastics.

“We have a waste and pollution crisis on our hands and the bottom has fallen out of our recycling market in the wake of China’s decision to no longer take our waste,” Allen said. “This legislation provides a comprehensive plan to transition manufacturers and consumers toward more sustainable packaging and products.”

Assm. Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego) introduced SB 50’s companion bill, Assembly Bill 1080. Both are called the California Circular Economy and Plastic Pollution Reduction Act. They follow two statewide measures aimed out phasing out plastics: last year’s law requiring businesses to only provide plastic straws on request and a 2014 ban on single-use plastic bags. Both laws were the first of their kind nationwide.

Allen also passed a law last September that requires state facilities to serve food in reusable, recyclable or compostable containers.

“The dire impacts of single-use plastic on our oceans, marine life, the broader environment and human health are too powerful to ignore,” Allen said. “And local cities are forced to spend millions of taxpayer dollars on waste management and cleanup that should be spent on other essential services.”

Santa Monica has already banned disposable food packaging, prohibiting plastic utensils, plates and containers, among other plastic, bio-plastic and aluminum packaging. Businesses must serve food in containers made marine-degradable paper, fiber or wood, although they can use plastic cups and cup lids until 2020 because marine-degradable versions are not yet available.

The ban went into effect Jan. 1 and is meant to protect Santa Monica Bay from plastic pollution and reduce landfilled waste in accordance with the City’s goal to achieve zero waste by 2030.

The California Grocers Association (CGA), a non-profit, statewide trade association that represents over 300 retail members in California and Nevada and 150 grocery supplier companies, opposed Santa Monica’s disposable food packaging ban, contending that usable marine degradable packaging did not yet exist. But CGA’s government affairs director, Aaron Moreno, said the association has been working with Allen to craft SB 54.

Moreno said Allen’s staff has been responsive to the association’s concerns about the differing needs of grocers and restaurants. While restaurants can more readily use biodegradable packaging, grocers need packaging that preserves food safety and shelf life for a much longer period of time, he said.

“We’re looking forward to continuing working with the authors on this measure,” Moreno said. “They get why we need what we need. We’re not trying to get out of anything.”

SB 54 and AB 1080 will now proceed to the opposite house for consideration.",United States,2019.06
154,One-bag garbage limit imposed,"As of Oct. 1, residents will only be permitted to put one bag of garbage at the curb.

A report going to the operations committee next week details the city’s plan to reduce our garbage output while promoting the longevity of our current landfill sites.

“The planned change from a two garbage bag limit to a one garbage bag limit per week is scheduled for October 2019,” the report stipulates. “This is the next transitional step in garbage collection leading to the final change in 2021 with every other week garbage collection.”

In February 2021, pick-up will be reduced to two bags every other week.

“In all three phases, the collection of leaf and yard trimmings will continue to be unlimited and there will be no change in the weekly collection frequency of unlimited blue box recyclables, green cart organics and large furniture, appliances and electronics,” the report notes.

Staff say the city is reducing refuse pick-up because much of what is thrown out could actually be recycled or composted.

“We estimate that approximately 45 per cent of residential garbage going to the landfill could have gone in the blue box, green cart or other divertible stream. These recyclable or compostable materials are valuable resources, and should not be buried in the landfill, even though our landfill capacity is over 25 years,” staff point out. “Landfill space remaining should be reserved for non-recyclable or non-compostable materials. The cost of a new landfill site is currently estimated at $40-50 million and could be up to $100 million to replace the current three landfill sites. Increase that cost to $200-300 million if waste to energy is selected rather than landfilling.”

The city also plans to maintain “a garbage bag tag program to allow residents to place extra garbage out for collection if required,” as well as support programs to provide residents with assistance for children’s diapers, medical refuse and pet waste. The city also plans to implement “a program to provide assistance for citizens with additional dog and cat waste. This will be launched in September 2019.”

Municipalities are thinking differently about trash these days. As the report indicates, they have moved away from thinking about waste management in a linear way and are moving towards incorporating it into a circular economy.

“At a municipal level, it is important that we align our own waste management views and practices with those that support a circular economy. Landfill space must be used optimally and valued as a scarce resource,” the report indicates. “Our waste management policies and practices should reflect the new era of regarding waste as a potential resource, which can be re-integrated back into the economy as a new product or reintroduced into the natural environment with benign and beneficial impacts. Our city will benefit from diverting materials that can be reused or recycled and minimizing the inefficient use of landfill capacity by postponing the expensive cost for closing landfill sites and constructing new sites. These funds can then be diverted to the maintenance of other important infrastructure requirements.”

The city is getting ready now for the flood of calls they expect in October.

“Training will again be provided to 311 staff to ensure they can answer as many questions as possible. Additional part-time hours have also been budgeted for this area to handle the expected increase in calls,” staff say in the report. “In addition, there will be a number of expertly trained environmental services staff who will deal directly with residents to answer questions and provide solutions.”

Staff also notes there will be a month-long transition period, during which there will be increased flexibility.

“It is expected that some citizens may not be immediately willing to change their waste disposal habits. Change can be difficult,” the report notes.

But as of Oct. 1, it will be inevitable.",Canada,2019.06
155,Lystek To Surpass 1 Million Tons Of Biofertilizer Sold By End Of 2019,"Award-winning biosolids and organics solutions firm, Lystek International (Lystek), leverages its low temperature Thermal Hydrolysis Process (Lystek THP) and value-added service offerings to manage the requirements of a growing number of generators of biosolids and organic residuals across North America. Solutions are provided via Lystek’s numerous in-plant deployments and two, large regional processing centers in Ontario, Canada and California, U.S.A. Each regional facility has an annual processing capacity of 150,000 tons per year and the collective of all Lystek-enabled treatment plants now totals over 395,000 tons annually. As part of its unique approach, Lystek has been expanding its offerings and providing end-to end resource recovery and product management services to the sector since 2012.

Lystek’s core business involves in the diversion and processing of biosolids and organics into a range of value-added products including the marketing and sales of LysteGro, a U.S. EPA Class A quality, high solid, liquid biofertilizer product in high demand from the agricultural sector. The product is also registered as a bulk mineral fertilizer with the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) and, in Canada, with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). This translates into excellent marketability and opportunities for revenue sharing arrangements with its customers. The company will surpass 1 million tons of LysteGro biofertilzer sold and responsibly managed by the end of 2019.

For example, in the town of Elora (Township of Centre Wellington), Ontario, Lystek has built a strong and growing market for LysteGro, selling 100% of the product into the local farm sector since the program officially launched in 2016. This program focuses on producing a high quality, federally registered fertilizer product that Lystek markets to area farmers. Growing demand for LysteGro has led to steadily increasing product prices and, due to the revenue sharing model between Centre Wellington and Lystek, returns have outpaced inflation and reduced the municipality’s biosolids management costs in recent years. By the third application season the customer saw a decrease in the costs of its program.

“It is showing to be a highly valued product in our area, and, as proof of that, our revenue sharing returns have reduced our biosolids management fees. That’s a real game changer,” says John den Hoed, Supervisor of Wastewater Services for the Township of Centre Wellington.

One of the key factors to the success of these programs has been the undertaking of third party agronomic trials and best management practices to demonstrate the effectiveness of LysteGro, both as a replacement for commercial fertilizer and as a means to build soil health. Even with increasing market prices and some revenue sharing to help offset management costs, the farmer is still receiving great value for the product, which has a high concentration of NPK as well as micronutrients and organic matter. Based on comparative pricing, to realize the total NPK equivalent in purchased commercial fertilizer, the cost would be approximately three times the current market price of LysteGro.

“Populations continue to grow and the resources required to make chemical fertilizers are being depleted. That is why the demand for responsible and affordable technology and practical solutions, including products like LysteGro, will continue to increase over time. At the same time, regulations around landfill diversion for organics are getting more stringent across North America and around the globe,” says Kurt Meyer, President of Lystek International. “We are proud to offer solutions that eliminate “waste” while contributing to the health and growth of the circular economy.”

156,Adidas to begin next phase towards plastic-free oceans,"In fight for the oceans against marine plastic pollution, Adidas is upping the pace of change with the return of Run For The Oceans 2019 on June 8, World Oceans Day. The brand with its long-term partner Parley for the Oceans aims to raise $1.5 million to continue to invest in the education of future generations on the issue of marine plastic pollution.

The introduction of the 2019 Parley range will see the company produce a landmark 11 million pairs of shoes using upcycled marine plastic waste. The campaign this year will also unite more runners in more locations than ever before to lace up and Run For The Oceans in order to reach its increased goal of $1.5 million. For every kilometer completed between June 8 and 16, Adidas will contribute $1 to Parley Ocean School programmes, with every dollar going towards the next phase of the partnership with the development and launch of the Parley youth activist platform.

Adidas and Parley raised $1 million raised from Run For The Oceans 2018 to support the Parley Ocean School Program, educating and empowering 100,000 youth in affected coastal areas. The partnership saw five million pairs of shoes created using recycled ocean plastic in 2018 alone.

With the aim of engaging more young people than ever before and inspiring long-term behavior change, the platform will host a digital curriculum which equips schoolchildren with the skills, tools and knowledge required to protect the planet’s oceans. It will also act as a digital space where young people can come together, share ideas and gain access to events, mentors, and tools. Sign-ups open for the Parley youth activist platform on June 8, with the goal of bringing the Parley Ocean School Program to a global level.

While Run For The Oceans is a global movement, in India, Adidas has given the movement further wings by associating with advocate Afroz Shah, the UN Champion of Earth 2016, starting from 2018. The purposeful initiative has resulted into activities that tackle the problem of marine litter. Cleaning Mumbai beaches, conserving the mangroves, running ground action workshop to stop litter and segregate plastic waste and most importantly the ideology of a circular economy. The Indian edition of the Run For The Oceans will be held in Mumbai on June 8 at the Versova beach.

This year, the brand has joined hands with eco champions and young leaders of sustainability including Abhimanyu Chakravorty (founder Plogga India & environment activist), and Sumer Verma (India’ first marine photographer & conservationist) take the movement wider.

Inspiring the larger universe to join the movement, Adidas is bringing together its community of adidas Runners, brand ambassadors, employees, store partners, store staff, and even consumers to make a difference and contribute to reducing marine plastic pollution by participating on the on-ground and digital runs.

“The marine plastic crisis we’re facing has become critically urgent. We affect it daily through the plastics we use and throw away. Every minute, the equivalent of a dump truck of plastic waste enters our oceans and by 2050, this could mean there may be more plastic than fish in the world’s oceans. We know the stats and we’re aware of the issue. Now we need action. adidas x Parley has helped spread awareness of the crisis facing our oceans but also contributed to finding solutions. Back in 2016, we created the first performance products with recycled ocean plastics and went on to produce six million pairs of Adidas x Parley shoes by 2018, with a goal of making 11 million units this year, intercepting vast amounts of plastic from entering our oceans,"" Sharad Singla, brand marketing director, Adidas India, said.

""Run for the Oceans is an opportunity to celebrate the oceans, a place where runners unite to dedicate their time and energy and generate investment towards saving our oceans – this year, for our new activist platform, a global stage for the next generation of creators, leaders and thinkers. As the voice of our future, our youth make the most convincing teachers and best ambassadors, educating parents, industry leaders and politicians, and using media in the most native way. Youth are our biggest hope, since they are driven by the strongest of all motivations: their own survival. We are more than grateful for the generous support of our founding partner Adidas. It allows us to grow the movement into a superstorm of change,” Cyrill Gutsch, founder and CEO, Parley for the Oceans, said. (RR)",United States,2019.06
159,TerraCycle Adds Loop To Its Circular Economy Repertoire,"Older readers may remember the days when the milkman would take away your empty milk bottles and replace them with full ones. CocaCola and hundreds of other products came in reusable containers. Commerce operated on what was known as the circular economy principle — the packaging that protected consumer products got returned to the source, cleaned, and used again and again.

Then came plastics, those space age wonders that allowed anything and everything to be packaged in single use containers that were simply discarded. Corporations loved them because they were cheap and relieved them of the burden of collecting all those glass bottles and reusing them. What used to be considered a necessary part of doing business now became somebody else’s problem. As usual when an economic model allows companies to privatize the profits but socialize the costs, profits soared.

Society, unfortunately, has not been so lucky. Today, millions of tons of plastics are resting for all eternity in landfills or floating in the world’s oceans. Pictures of plastic waste have been circulating on the internet for the past few years, showing mounds of plastics washed up on beaches on some of the world’s most remote islands. Microplastics have been found in the deepest parts of the ocean an atop the highest mountains. The public is finally recognizing that plastic waste is a huge problem that is getting worse by the day.

TerraCycle is a global company that sees a business opportunity in promoting a circular economy. “We have found that nearly everything we touch can be recycled and collect typically non-recyclable items through national, first-of-their-kind recycling platforms,” it says on its website. “Leading companies work with us to take hard-to-recycle materials from our programs, such as ocean plastic, and turn them into new products, and our new Loop platform aims to change the way the world shops with favorite brands in refillable packaging offered with convenience and style.”

“We envision the future of how we consume as a place where we receive higher quality, better designed products, that we can “throw in a bin” when they are finished with no cleaning, no sorting, and no hassle. But instead of that bin being a trash or recycling bin, it’s a Loop reuse bin, where everything is cleaned and goes around again and again. The future is not just about sustainability, it’s about a better life, where we can access breakthrough sustainability unconsciously.”

At the latest World Economic Forum meeting, Loop announced it had formed circular economy partnerships with Procter & Gamble, Nestlé, PepsiCo, Unilever, Mars, Clorox, Coca-Cola, Mondelēz, and Danone. Customers can order products from a variety of companies that are shipped to them in returnable and reusable containers packed inside a reusable blue Loop container.

When the products are consumed, the containers are placed inside a similar Loop container, picked up by UPS or other package delivery service, and returned to the point of origin for re-use. Customers pay a modest service fee of the use of the Loop container. CleanTechnica reader Jessica Feinleib uses the Loop service and can’t say enough good things about it. “This is a great clean tech idea,” she says.

Taming the torrent of single use plastic containers is vital to reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. According to an article from EDF on Medium, the International Energy Agency claims in a recent study that the manufacture of plastics will be one of the biggest drivers of an increase in the use of petroleum between now and 2050.

In other words, we can all start driving electric cars but oil production — and the carbon emissions from oil — will continue to rise unless we do something about our insatiable appetite for single use plastics. In the final analysis, destroying the world for the sake of convenience is a monumentally dumb idea.",United States,2019.09
160,Unlocking the circular economy — Petrochemical manufacturers lead the charge to reinvent recycling,"Petrochemical manufacturers are commonly known as creators of the building blocks for plastic. But increasingly, they're making headlines for reversing that process — turning used plastic products back into their original building-block monomers — and advancing other recycling solutions critical to addressing concerns about plastic waste.

Plastic products are vital to our lives, enabling everything from food preservation, to sanitation in health care, to technology and virtual connection, to energy innovations like solar panels and wind turbines. There is no doubt that modern life is improved by plastics — yet each year, consumers around the world throw away approximately 150 million tons of it, roughly half of all the plastic produced globally, according to researchers. Dealing with that waste has become a top priority not only for the plastics industry, but also its main supplier, the petrochemical industry.

Many in the petrochemical sector — including some of the leading chemists, material scientists and engineers in the world — are applying their ingenuity to the problem by turning waste into valuable new resources with promising results:
• Tennessee-based Eastman Chemical announced its breakthrough carbon renewal technology in April on the heels of its advanced circular recycling technology announcement in March. This newest technology will help to divert waste from landfills by recycling complex plastics, including mixed- and non-polyester plastics, back to basic molecular components for new product manufacturing ranging from textiles to health care products.
• Americas Styrenics, a Chevron Phillips Chemical Co./Trinseo joint venture along with Agilyx, is working on an effort to convert waste polystyrene — a resin not as easy to mechanically recycle — back into the styrene monomer, which can then be used to make new PS called PolyUsable.
• Saudi Basic Industries Corp. last June became the first petrochemical company to announce plans to invest in a project to convert mixed plastic waste — which includes difficult-to-recycle combined products like bottles, film and plastic film — into original feedstock. That project, with a facility set to open in 2021, is based in the Netherlands.
• LyondellBasell partnered last year with Suez, a leader in advanced mechanical recycling, to form quality circular polymers, which is developing recycled resins to compete in quality and price with resins from virgin material. It is also partnering with Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany to test chemical recycling.

One of the big misunderstandings about plastics recycling is that any combination of plastics can be melted down together and reformed into something else. That's just not the case. Different types of plastics require different recycling processes, and in some cases, complex structures engineered to meet demanding performance standards renders these compositions difficult to recycle. Another challenge is collecting a large volume of high-quality material that is clean and pure enough for secondary use — difficult in many parts of the country where recycling is comingled. Food residue, glues, glass shards or even a smattering of the wrong types of plastics can contaminate resin.

Petrochemical manufacturers — who transform oil and natural gas into monomers, polymers and plastic resins — are pioneering chemical recycling and breaking new ground in mechanical recycling, turning what would otherwise be plastic waste into valuable resources. As an answer to this challenge, petrochemical manufacturers, including some listed above, are advancing chemical recycling — a process wherein plastic is recycled into fuel or stripped down to its fundamental building blocks (monomers) and then refashioned into polymers in the form of pellets. This chemical recycling process can be repeated over and over without jeopardizing strength and quality.

Chemical recycling presents a world with unlimited reuse opportunities. Whether it be liquid fuel, recycled clothing or food-grade packaging, it is possible for plastic to become something entirely new. That is why chemical recycling is seen as the critical technology needed to unlock a truly circular economy.

Advances in chemical and mechanical recycling are maximizing value in products that would likely be destined for waste. Both recycling technologies will play a pivotal role in the global response to plastic waste, and in years to come, could flip the script for plastic waste entirely. The petrochemical industry, and the full force of its engineering expertise and creative problem-solving, are committed to achieving those breakthroughs and ensuring a more sustainable future.",United States,2019.09
164,Can There Be Harmony Between Plastics and Sustainability? Greiner Says Yes.,"With plastics companies being somewhat critical players when it comes to solving our plastics problem, so it’s great to see them beginning to commit to circularity. Greiner, an Austria-based private maker of plastics and foams, is one of the latest to drive a stake in the ground on circularity in plastic. While you may not have heard of them, they make CPG packaging ranging from cups to ketchup bottles, medical devices and seat cushions for airlines, so chances are high that you’ve used one of their products.

In 2015, Greiner launched its sustainability strategy, Plastics for Life; and this year, the company issued its first sustainability report. It includes 2030 targets to introduce an internal carbon pricing system by 2020; ensure all plastic packaging manufactured is suitable for recycling, reuse or composting by 2025; eliminate superfluous packaging; and ensure that by 2025, a considerable portion of recycled material goes into its products. The company has signed onto the Ellen MacArthur Foundation‘s New Plastics Economy Global Commitment to establish a circular economy for plastic packaging.

We caught up with Stefan Grafenhorst, Greiner’s Head of Sustainability, to find out more about the path toward making plastic a sustainable material.

Greiner’s new sustainability strategy is called “Plastics for Life.” Can you explain the company vision of how plastics and sustainability go hand in hand?

Stefan Grafenhorst: Virtually no one mentions plastics and sustainability in the same breath, and this is something that we wish to change. Accordingly, our “Plastics for Life” strategy is intended to demonstrate that in fact plastics and sustainability do not represent a contradiction in terms. Indeed, we at Greiner are convinced that quite the reverse is true — and that when coupled with correct disposal, plastics can prove beneficial to the environment. This is because owing to their lightness, comparatively low-energy production and diverse applications, they help to reduce power consumption and emissions, and thus safeguard the climate. For example, the product protection offered by plastics in the foods area prolongs shelf life to such an extent that waste is prevented and the environmental burden minimized.

However, the most important aspect of our strategy is to lend our business activities to circularity. Specifically, this means that today we are working far more closely with other companies along the value chain, because those seeking to lend their products a recyclable design must exchange ideas with the recycling industry. Moreover, those wishing to reduce environmental impact must concern themselves intensively with the eco-balance of their products. We are now cooperating with material manufacturers to a still greater extent, and discuss with our customers the options available for a reduction in environmental impact through product design. No one is capable of achieving the transition to a circular economy in isolation; therefore, the integration of the value chain and strategic partners constitutes a cornerstone of our strategy.

As a plastics manufacturer, how can Greiner make sure our use of plastics is sustainable?

SG: As a packaging manufacturer, we naturally play a truly significant role. If we do our job properly and develop sustainable packaging, this will make life somewhat easier for everyone along the value chain. We have the key to circularity in our hands; and in this connection, sustainability implies the achievement of packaging recyclability by means of optimization and further development. Part of this process involves product advances, which will lead to production and disposal that merely leave the smallest possible environmental footprint. Therefore, we test all our products with regard to their recyclability — and, should this be lacking, our developers and designers evolve new solutions. We constantly have the complete ecological perspective in view, as for us the overall environmental balance is of cardinal importance. Indeed, it constitutes our paramount guiding principle, and we can only be satisfied with our efforts when the eco-balance has been enhanced. All in all, it can be stated that the better the eco-design, the more sustainable is the use of plastic.

When should we use plastics and when should we not use them? As a company, where are you starting to not use them or use them differently?

SG: In view of the current criticism regarding plastics, it may sound somewhat grotesque, but a world without them is an illusion. In my opinion, if we now succeed in creating a functional, recycling system for plastic, it will come to represent an unrivaled sustainable material. Our benchmark is always formed by an overall ecological evaluation; if other packaging materials offer a superior life cycle assessment then, to a certain degree, this rules out the use of plastic and other materials must take precedence. Nevertheless, we as a society — and hence, every single consumer — must naturally question our conduct as consumers and ask if this is sustainable. Moreover, part of the truth is that, on occasion, we employ excessive packaging and we have a throwaway lifestyle, which presents a less than sustainable image.

How is Greiner putting circularity into practice? Specifically, how are you increasing the reusability and recyclability of your products?

SG: The concept of the circular economy undoubtedly represents the future — not only for us, but the entire packaging industry. Therefore, the design of our products is subject to daily scrutiny; and at the back of our minds, we constantly have the question, “Can this product be recycled in the country where it is to be marketed?” We wish to see our packaging reenter the economic cycle; and although this objective may seem banal, it is nonetheless challenging. Consequently, we have recently begun to employ a variety of analytical tools in order to ensure recyclability.

Only a few weeks ago, a minimum standard for recyclable design was issued in Germany; without question, this is an important step forward that will unleash an enormous amount of energy. Moreover, together with our customers, we are undertaking increasingly frequent analyses of the recyclability of our packaging. As at present a uniform European standard is lacking, we attempt to be active on a number of levels, as indicated by the prominent example of our partnership with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. In this connection, together with numerous with many other companies, we have compiled a definition of recyclability, and thus hope to contribute to an improvement.

What are some examples of how your products are now able to be reused or recycled, and who have you partnered with to extend their life?

SG: We have undertaken an obligation to ensure that by 2025 all of our packaging will be of recyclable design; and clearly, if this target is to be reached, a great deal remains to be done. We are engaged in an ongoing dialogue with our customers regarding all our products and discuss the possible form of design changes aimed at improving their recyclability. Unfortunately, a one-size-fits-all approach to guaranteeing the recycling capacity of plastic packaging does not exist; and therefore, a type of separate partnership exists for each product. However, in order to enhance the material flows in general, we have for example involved ourselves and invested in the digital watermark thematic area, which could result in a major contribution to correct sorting. In addition, both within the scope of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and on a European level, we are involved primarily in projects that focus on the employment of recyclates. Here, too, a sizable volume of work is outstanding; but nonetheless, we regard this as a major opportunity and are optimistic that we can respond to the criticism of plastics with the correct answers.",United States,2019.09
166,"Blow molding sector seeks quality, speed, sustainability","The companies that build the machines for producing everything from water bottles and cosmetic containers to automotive fuel tanks and industrial drums will show their latest developments in running recycled materials and speeding up cycle times and mold changes at K 2019.

Like their plastic industry colleagues, the builders of blow molders are focusing on how their machines contribute to the circular economy. The aim is to preserve resources and eliminate waste as opposed to a linear economy of take, make and dispose.

To that end, watch for major blow molding machine manufacturers to show how recycled content can be incorporated in three-layer bottles. Engineers and R&D teams in the industry also have intensified their focus on reducing energy use by improving electric drives and control systems.

Machine manufacturers also have been improving the molten tubes that are inflated with air to take the shape of the cavity for container production.

Here are some of the highlights to be presented from the blow molding industry.

Bekum Maschinenfabriken GmbH (Hall 14, Booth C3) will present its newly designed blow molding machine for packaging that can contribute to the circular economy.

The Berlin-based company, which is celebrating its 60th anniversary, has a K show exhibit theme of ""focused on the future."" Its latest machine, called Concept 808, will use Bekum's tri-extrusion technology, which can process single-origin polyethylene and polypropylene scrap. The post-consumer material can be embedded between layers of virgin plastic materials, which also reduces the cost to manufacture containers.

The new machine also has a magnetic quick mold change system, a next-generation control system and other improvements that reduce energy consumption by 20 percent.

Egg Harbor Township, N.J.-based Jomar Corp. (Hall 14, Booth A32) is encouraging new processors of bottles produced by injection blow molding to check out its Model 25 machine that comes with an ""entry-level price."" The machine replaces the Model 20, which will be discontinued.

""We've found that customers wanted a Jomar, but they either didn't have the capital required for our larger machines or couldn't meet their annual volume requirements with our Model 20,"" Jomar President Carlos Castro said in a news release. ""The need to provide a high-quality, high-volume machine at a lower price point drove the development of the Model 25.""

The company says it sold its first machine to a cosmetics company.",United States,2019.09
167,Report examines potential economic benefit of recycling in Alberta,"Alberta, Canada’s recycling sector generated $700 million in economic value and supported more than 7,500 direct jobs in 2018, according to a new report. The report also found the potential economic benefit of recycling in the region could be $1.4 billion and 13,000 jobs if action was taken to increase Alberta’s recycling programs.

The report, commissioned by the Recycling Council of Alberta (RCA) and funded by Alberta Economic Development and Trade, Alberta Recycling Management Authority, Beverage Container Management Board and Cleanfarms, documents the type and scale of recycling in Alberta. Undertaken by Eunomia Research & Consulting, United Kingdom, it measures the economic and employment benefits the sector brings to the province, including job creation, wages, provincial tax benefit, capital investment and overall contribution to Alberta's gross domestic product (GDP).

The study found that 75 percent of households in Alberta have access to curbside recycling services and 44 percent have access to organics diversion programs for recycling organics. The research estimates that 1.15 million tons of material were diverted for recycling in 2018, an average of 260 kilograms per household.

Despite the overall success of the sector, researchers found “significantly more could be done to increase the amount of recycling taking place.” Material being diverted for recycling could nearly double if action was taken to “increase and diversify Alberta’s recycling programs,” according to the analysis.

""This report confirms Alberta's recycling industry already provides significant value to our economy, and validates the additional value that would be created if Alberta expanded and enhanced its recycling systems to simply meet what is already achieved in other provinces,” RCA President Jodi London says. “The bottom line is Alberta has an opportunity to capitalize on its waste generation and diversify its economy by moving swiftly to adopt progressive approaches that will see materials like packaging and paper effectively managed to become part of a circular economy.""



Sarah Edwards, the lead author of the report, adds, ""While it's fantastic to see the economic benefits that the current recycling system provides to Alberta, it's important to note that there are huge benefits to expanding current activities. Alberta leads the way in the diversity of services it offers and maximizing the potential of these will only increase the economic, employment and environmental benefits to the province.""



The results will be presented at RCA's conference Sea Change.",United States,2019.09
170,Sustainable Product-Service Systems and Circular Economies,"Sustainable product-service systems (PSSs) have proven to be a very good alternative for developing new business models and transforming traditional offers into sustainable ones. Environmental, social and economic benefits support the idea of developing this type of system. However, there are identified challenges that have stopped the expansion of the concept into the market. The framework that explains the principles and building blocks of a circular economy according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation can be an interesting lens to analyse the challenges companies faced when they wanted to implement a sustainable PSS. This framework is particularly useful to understand the internal and external forces companies are dealing with in a transformation from traditional business models to ones like sustainable PSSs that need special conditions of operation. Design for sustainability as an area of study will shift in the coming years to focus its attention on the requirements of circular economics as the paradigm of production and consumption. Sustainable products, services and systems will be developed according to the conditions established by those circular conditions. View Full-Text",United States,2019.09

For all the talk of German’s flirtation with recession, Brexit’s expected toll on the economy and a deepening trade war between the US and China, the economy as reflected in unemployment rates in Ireland and across Europe continues to look healthy, at least for now.

The latest monthly data is reported this week (Ireland on Tuesday and the Euro zone on Monday) and ought to be a continuation of the trend.

At the beginning of September, Central Statistics Office (CSO) numbers showed the jobless rate fell to 5.2 per cent last month, a post-crash low. Seasonally adjusted numbers of those classified as unemployed was at 126,000 in August, down 1,800 on the previous month.

Ireland’s performance is also two percentage points lower than the current euro area average of 7.5 per cent, for July, while the EU 28 figure for the same period was at 6.3 per cent.

Germany, a weathervane for European health, avoided recession last year but its output fell by 0.1 per cent in the second quarter and many believe things will get worse before they get better.

Even still, the latest data for the Euro area was unchanged from the previous month’s 11-year low and the number of unemployed continues to decline. The broader European Union number, meanwhile, is at its lowest since the start of monthly unemployment figures at the beginning of the century.

179,Blue Economy: Time to walk the talk,"We need to walk the talk. We have spoken well. We have shown the commitment. We need to hit the ground running. There is a lot pressure on land resources and food security as a result of climate change, that requires that the country urgently prioritizes use of water based resources.

Those charged with the responsibility of implement the country’s blue economy strategy should support the President’s commitment and determination to actualize the larger circular economy principle, which is part of SDG 12 to which Kenya a signatory. In addition to the President’s commitment, we need to contribution of the private sector in terms of investments, academy in terms of researches and civil society contribution on sustainable use of resources advocacy. Following the Nairobi Blue Economy conference in 2018, participants made voluntary commitments amounting to $172.2 million in various aspects of the Blue Economy, as well as several non-monetary commitments in areas like partnerships and capacity-building. How far re we with this?

If the death and destruction of corals around Watamu, environmental pollution along the beaches in Diani and in Rivers draining in Lake Victoria, poor fishing methods on Lakes Turkana and Victoria and massive destruction of water catchment area s across the country are anything to go by, its becoming late. Coupled with the adverse effects of climate change, preserving and using resources from the oceans and other water bodies need jump- starting.

The President has done well so far in giving the much needed political will and signed relevant legislation to kick-start the implementation process, but there is seems inertia in the sector. He assented to the Fisheries management and Development Act 2016 and the Climate Change Act 2016, established the Presidential Task Force on the Blue Economy, Hosted global conference on Blue Economy in Nairobi in 2018 and made a presentation on the sidelines of the 2019 UNGAS in New York about his commitment on the Blue Economy. He created the Coast Guards and Marine force to patrol our water borders to ensure proper uses of the marine resources.

We are yet to see practical strategies and implementation of interventions on how to deal with risks such as depletion of resources and degradation of ecosystems through overfishing or destruction of habitat; pollution, including eutrophication, industrial wastes, endocrine disrupters, invasive species that can compromise industrial cooling systems, overtake ecosystems or interfere with aquaculture through toxicity or reduction of yields; coastal erosion exacerbated by storm surge; and the hazards of wind, waves, currents and ice in the broad range of extreme environments where marine operations are conducted. The Fisheries Management and Development Act 2016 requires the establishment of the Fisheries Service Advisory Council and Kenya Fish Marketing Authority to negotiate partnership and fishing access agreements, fisheries monitoring and patrol mechanisms and improve aquaculture to commercial levels. This is yet to be done.

Coastal and island states are at the forefront of the Blue Economy movement, advocating for solutions tailored to their circumstances, constraints and challenges. Some see the Blue Economy as only including ocean and marine resources; for others, the Blue Economy refers to the sustainable use all water resources (oceans, seas, lakes, rivers and wetlands) for economic growth, improved livelihoods and job creation. Seas, lakes, rivers and wetlands all feed into oceans and marine zones, thereby broadly contributing, in one way or another, to the Blue Economy concept.

In Kenya, UN-Habitat provides technical input in Kisumu’s Lakefront Planning Initiative, a project developed to create quality public space along the lakeshore, while ensuring environmental protection, thereby enhancing the investment potential of the city’s central business district. The Mama Ngina Water Front in Mombasa is another Government led initiative that is show of the commitment.

The Presidential Task Force of Blue Economy needs to be visible and more pro active in pushing the agenda of the president as time is not with us. Public institutions including universities and research agencies must forefront on this issue.",United States,2019.09
180,The state of the world according to the UN | Atty. Jose Ferdinand M. Rojas II,"TO conclude the three-part series on the update of the United Nations regarding the achievements related to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, here is the summary of the report on Responsible Consumption and Production; Climate Action; Life Below Water; Life on Land; Place, Justice and Strong Institutions; and Partnerships for the Goals.

The way humans consume is killing the planet. In exchange for industrialization and economic growth, our natural resources are being depleted and our environment suffers. More effort and action are necessary to move the Earth toward a sustainable, circular economy.

Since the year 1990, the global material footprint has more than doubled. This refers to the amount of raw materials needed to meet the world’s consumption demands. In addition, about one-third of the food produced every year is wasted or lost, and this happens most in rich or developed countries.

And the greatest challenge to sustainable development? Yes, climate change. The UN says that in order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2030, the total carbon emissions the world over should decrease by 45 percent compared to the 2010 levels. We can see around us that governments are doing something about this. As of May 2019, there were 182 countries (and the European Union) that have set their first nationally determined contributions. They are also committed to increasing the budgets for projects that address climate change. Likewise, more countries are doing more to protect our oceans.

According to the Red List Index, the risk of extinction is higher today than in the last 25 years. This index tracks the species on Earth. The increase is apparently due to unsustainable agricultural practices, climate change, and deforestation.

As far as Place, Justice and Strong Institutions are concerned, the UN’s report revealed that we all have a long way to go. In many places around the world, many of those who are trying to push this agenda are being killed. From January to October 2018 alone, an average of nine people were murdered each week. These victims include journalists, human-rights defenders, and other people who work on the front lines of building a more inclusive and just society. In 2015 to 2017, the average was seven people killed every week.

Based on the update from the UN, there is support for the SDG, generally. However, overseas aid or Official Development Assistance dropped 2.7 percent to $149 billion from 2017 to 2018. This funding is the biggest source of external financing for the poorer nations. And finally, to be able to spread the word about the SDG campaigns, access to the Internet is greatly needed. Statistics show that more than 80 percent of people in developed countries were online in 2018. However, this number was just 20 percent for the least developed countries. The disparity means that there is more work to be done in order to create an inclusive global information society.",United States,2019.09
182,Circular Economy in the Tourism Sector,"In order to survive the changing landscape of the tourism sector, firms will have to adapt to new trends and consumers’ desires caused by the emergence of sharing economy companies

The economy was pictured until recently as linear, with a strong tendency to satisfy the consumers’ needs with brand new products, somehow to give them a feeling of exclusivity. However, a full range of environmental, socio-demographic and economic indicators, mostly alarming, rose the need to change our consumption and production habits. One of the main and current issues discussed in the media is climate change, of which principal source is, according to studies, households’ consumption, thus including consumption of tourism. To tackle this problem, new ways of thinking the economy appeared since few years, in particular in developed countries, and circular economy embodies most of them.

Linear vs circular economy: a very different approach

Linear economy is the current approach taken by most market economies. This strategy can simplistically be seen as the famous take-make-dispose approach. Although those three steps do not completely disappear in circular economy, they greatly lose importance.

If we still need to take (i.e. extract) resources, it has to be done in a lesser extent and obviously with a greater respect for our planet. In fact, the theoretical foundations of circular economy are more in favor of borrowing instead of taking. Economically speaking, Earth should now be included in the economic circuit as an additional economic actor (besides consumers, producers, Government, financial institutions and the rest of the World).

Circular economy does not mean the end of production – but goods and services have now to be designed to minimize resources needed, to last, to be repairable, and more importantly to be reusable or, at least recyclable. The lifespan linearity of a given product/service is considerably reduced if not totally eliminated.

Although both types of economies aim at achieving the same goal, that is produce a good or service to satisfy the demand, the approach to achieve the objective is fundamentally different.

Despite the discrepancy between linear and circular economy, the way to compute economic growth has not really evolved and leads to a major macroeconomic concern. Indeed, the linear economy approach was adopted because it was probably the fastest way to produce ever more, facilitating growth (for the firm and for the economy as a whole).

Does that mean circular economy leads to the end of positive economic growth rates? This is not a trivial question. On one hand – in the new economy approach – production (in quantities) may decrease given that goods are reused, but on the other hand the goods produced may incorporate more value added to satisfy new consumption patterns.

Moreover, no matter the final outcome on growth rates; at this point it is probably wise to ask ourselves if the current method used to compute economic growth (through GDP) is appropriate. Indeed, if consumers feel better off re-using goods instead of buying new ones, if firms are better off producing less goods but with higher value added, if Earth is better off with those eco-friendly goods, then, those fundamental changes in behavior should lead to new measures of what is nowadays called economic growth.

It is easier to see how the concepts of circular economy can affect the manufacturing sectors rather than the service sectors as, for instance, the tourism industry.

Nonetheless, a link between circular economy and the tourism sector does exist. Think about what a tourist (defined by the World Tourism Organization as a person traveling and staying at least one night and less than one year to a destination outside his usual environment) does when starting his consumption of tourism.

First, he prepares his trip, then he travels. When reaching his destination, he likely uses local transports, he settles in his chosen accommodation, consumes food and partakes in some local activities. Finally, he travels back. All seven steps are compatible with circular economy.

The seven steps of tourism activity

A given destination can obviously – mostly, if not only – impact all the steps from accommodation to local activities as they take place in the destination itself. It is worth noting at this stage that migration towards circular economy is not only a producer concern. Indeed, the tourist is the one deciding how to travel, i.e. with which transportation mean and with which company, and what to do at destination.

Moreover and although it has to be admitted that the supply is still relatively lean, there are already possibilities for a consumer to consume tourism in a circular way. For instance, the Crowne Plaza in Copenhagen has a room heating system connected to the booking software. If a room is not booked, the heating is set at its minimum. This same hotel collects food waste in its basement and uses it to produce bio-gas.

The next question being, should the economic actors active in the tourism sector migrate towards circular economy?

Economically speaking, there are good reasons to believe that firms within the tourism sector have a vested interest to adapt their production process to what I like to name circular tourism.

Most of the firms in the tourism sector are in, what we call in microeconomics, monopolistic competition. In a nutshell, each firm has competitors but they have been able to differentiate from each other. Actually, the more they can differentiate themselves from their competitors, the higher the market power and therefore the bigger the potential economic profit.

Transitioning from linear to circular tourism is currently definitely a way to differentiate. Furthermore, costs for firms integrating the concepts of circular economy will not necessarily increase. Philips Lighting has shifted from selling light bulbs to offering lighting-as-a-service. In so doing, customers, including companies active in the tourism sector, save money by paying only for the light they use. This latter process is in line with the reduction of goods & services’ possession (linear view) and in favor of borrowing goods & services (circular view).

Another example is DSM-Niaga which now produces 100%-recyclable carpets that use 95% less energy and no water.

Finally, it is said that 60% of food that is thrown away currently in the tourism sector can be relatively easily avoided. Thus, a hotel or restaurant aiming at producing zero waste increases already its chances to survive the coming years. If the transition towards circular economy is wisely done, costs do not necessarily increase. Moreover, even if costs slightly increase, they will undoubtedly be offset by the higher turnover the firm will be able to make (since they differentiate even more they may be able to set a higher price and, additionally, the total demand for goods and services in line with circular economy increases).

In the long run, as competitors will adapt to also comply with circular tourism, prices will probably slightly decrease and the economic profit potentially lower down. However, and even if economic profits arising from the shift towards circular tourism may decrease a bit with time, not adapting to the new models of consumption will lead to its business death, at least in the long run. Indeed, the news concerning the climate show it well, very soon consumers may not accept anymore to consume goods & services unhealthy for our planet.

Little by little, as most of the Fortune 500 companies are now service oriented, most industrialized countries are shifting from goods to services economies. Tourism is a prime example of a service oriented sector. Consumers’ habits are changing fast. In Switzerland, the consumption of organic products has increased by 50% in only five years. The great emergence of sharing economy companies (Airbnb, Couchsurfing, Uber, etc.) is an additional proof of the radical change in consumers’ habits. If the current firms active in the tourism sector do not adapt to those new trends and consumers’ desires, there is little hope they will survive.

Changes to set up do not necessarily need to be radical, the ultimate goal being to show the consumers that their desires are seriously considered and that efforts are undertook to satisfy them. The quicker the actors will adapt, the smoother will be the transition towards circular tourism.",United States,2019.09
183,Charlotte launches Send Me on My Way recycling initiative,"CHARLOTTE – Envision Charlotte and the City of Charlotte have partnered with Sealed Air, Coca-Cola Consolidated and the Charlotte Area Transit System for Send Me on My Way, a campaign to educate residents and increase recycling rates.

The initiative will use ambassadors at companies to educate their employees about recycling.

CATS will collect certain plastics on a retired, retrofitted bus and deliver them to Coca-Cola Consolidated and Sealed Air. The plastics will become new packaging or transformed into new materials, such as polyester.

“The ability to put recycled content back into our packaging is not a matter of science, it’s a matter of infrastructure,” said Ken Chrisman, Sealed Air’s senior vice president of commercial operations. “Most cities aren’t able to harvest and efficiently recycle flexible plastic materials, and there is little to no financial incentive for facilities to invest in upgrades because there is a limited market for the recycled material. That must change. Sealed Air wants to help facilitate that change.”

Kimberly Kuo, senior vice president of public affairs at Coca-Cola Consolidated, said her company has been active in sustainability for many years.

“Many of our plastic bottles are 100% recyclable, so we are eager to collect and reuse the plastic for new beverage packaging,” Kuo said. “We believe every plastic bottle can be recycled and reused for new bottles or other valuable consumer goods.”

Charlotte households generate over 144,000 tons of plastics annually, but only 3,000 tons are recycled. In 2018, Charlotte announced it would develop a circular economy strategy. The Send Me on My Way campaign will run through July 2020.

184,City of Boulder launches Climate Mobilization Action Plan,"Correction: This article previously stated that according to 350 Head of Global Finance Campaigns Brett Fleischman, 33 banks in the past three years have contributed over $100 trillion to coal power, fracking and the like. This figure is actually over $1 trillion.

Following the declaration of a climate emergency by the City of Boulder in July, city council held a launch event Thursday for a Climate Mobilization Action Plan (CMAP) aimed at aggressively combating climate change in Boulder. The event included presentations from several big actors in CMAP.

The presentations opened with a performance by Young Women’s Voices 4 Climate, a group for girls aged 13-16 that fuses “theater communication and project-based learning for the sake of climate change.” The group is run by SPEAK, an organization dedicated to making women’s voices heard.

The group used skits, costumes and music to communicate what individuals can do to help the environment. Two examples were reducing food waste and adopting a plant-rich diet. The most important tip for the group was to educate girls; as they marry later, have fewer children and “make sustainable choices for our community.”

Senior Policy Advisor for Climate, Sustainability & Resilience Brett KinCairn said Boulder has a “legacy” of climate action with some of the “most progressive land-use laws in the country.”

“Boulder, like every other place on the planet right now, faces one of the greatest challenges that we’ve ever faced as a species,” KinCairn said.

Equity was added to the list of focus areas in 2016, followed by land use and finance per the request of Boulder citizens. Present on the panel of the presentation were:

Mayor Jones represented the circular materials economy focus area. Aside from her municipal duties, Jones serves as the executive director of the environmental organization Eco-Cycle. The goal of Eco-Cycle, Jones said, is to take zero waste and circular economy approaches to environmental sustainability.

According to Jones, 42% of the climate footprint in the United States is from consumption emissions.

Eco-Cycle is approaching sustainability in four ways: reducing the production of single-use plastics, making Boulder and Boulder County a zero-waste model, carbon farming and helping the rest of Colorado and specifically Denver “go from zero waste laggers to leaders.

Representing the financial systems focus area was Brett Frischmann, Head of Global Finance Campaigns for 350, an organization working towards ending the use of fossil fuels.

The two main goals of CMAP relating to financial systems, Fleischman said, are the shift of financial investments away from contributors to climate change and creating mechanisms that will finance a just transition to ecological sustainability.

Fleischman said that in the last three years, 33 banks have contributed over $1 trillion to coal power, fracking and other fossil fuel industries — the top contributor being Chase Bank.

“This is an opportunity for systems change,” Fleischman said. “We’re also going to talk about a Boulder Green New Deal.”

Many facets of the presentation encouraged individuals to also take action. Rella Abernathy, a member of Boulder’s ecological planning team, spoke in support of these individual practices.

“By changing your practices, your neighbors see you do it,” Abernathy explained. “And then they’re more open to the changes they see.”

Outside of the presentation were several booths representing the different focus areas of CMAP. Attendees had the opportunity to speak with government employees about climate initiatives and give feedback by writing on whiteboards next to each table.

CU political science graduate Adam Charny said that Boulder involving the public in CMAP helps them to “understand how much detail it takes to actually make the change.”

Naropa University psychology student Faye Kovler added that the event can inspire other people to say “if they have this all figured out, there’s hope for us to figure it out.’”",United States,2019.09

By combining an ultra-efficient electric motor, magnetic levitation, and a low-drag environment, the Virgin Hyperloop One system will be 5 to 10 times more energy-efficient than an airplane and faster than high-speed rail using less energy.

Virgin Hyperloop One’s infrastructure can also support the creation of renewable energy by integrating solar panel technology across the outdoor transport tube system. Depending on the climate, the integration of solar technology could generate two-thirds of a route’s projected energy needs.

Virgin Hyperloop One is currently working with the Indian government of Maharashtra on a route between Pune and Mumbai. With a combined population of 25 million, the regional city pair sees more than 75 million commuting trips annually, a number which is expected to skyrocket to 130 million by 2026. The implementation of a regional Virgin Hyperloop One system could reduce local greenhouse gas emissions by up to 150,000 tons (300 million pounds) annually while creating 1.8 million new jobs and $36 billion in economic impact across the region.

In addition to Virgin Hyperloop One’s commitment to reduce the environmental impact of the transportation industry, Virgin Hyperloop One joins the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Circular Economy 100 Network (CE100) as an ‘emerging innovator’.

The CE100 brings together businesses, innovators, cities, governments, and universities committed to accelerating the transition to a circular economy. By joining the CE100 network, Virgin Hyperloop One commits to creating a circular hyperloop framework that is restorative and regenerative by design, establishing methods to reuse decommissioned elements of its system and reducing its carbon output. Virgin Hyperloop One is the first mass transportation company to join the prestigious network, which includes companies like Google, Apple, and Unilever.

Jay Walder, CEO of Virgin Hyperloop One, said:

In the United States, ten states are now exploring hyperloop including Missouri, Texas, Colorado, Ohio, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Washington, Indiana, and Oregon – in addition to Nevada which hosts the test site. The United States House of Representatives recently fully funded the U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao’s New and Emerging Transportation Technologies (NETT) Council, which was established to research and standardize hyperloop technology.

Today’s event at Rockefeller Plaza introduced New Yorkers to energy-efficient hyperloop technology, showcasing the real-world XP-1 test vehicle and allowing passers-by to envision what the introduction of a hyperloop route could mean for their lives when cities were connected like metro stops and the location is no longer a constraint when choosing where to live or work.

The Virgin Hyperloop One stop in New York is part of a broader roadshow across the United States, which has already made stops in Dallas-Fort Worth, Kansas City, and Columbus. Following New York, Virgin Hyperloop One will make stops in Raleigh and Washington D.C.",United States,2019.09
186,Procter & Gamble And PureCycle Collaborate On Polypropylene Recycling Process,"As of 2015, approximately 6,300 million metric tons of plastic waste had been generated, of which only 9% had been recycled, 12% had been incinerated, and 79% had accumulated in landfills or been dumped in the ocean according to a study published in Science Advances.

Procter & Gamble uses a lot of plastic in its business, much of it for containers and packaging. Many of those containers are made from polypropylene, an especially tough, long-lasting plastic that is hard to recycle. Even when recycling is attempted, the colors and aromas embedded in the original waste products remain, turning the end product into a gray or black substance that still has a powerful odor to it, which is hardly something other companies are willing to pay good money for.

Working in collaboration with PureCycle Technologies, a subsidiary of Chicago-based Innventure, Procter & Gamble says it has perfected a process that results in recycled polypropylene that is odor-free and snowy white or clear in color — which makes it highly desirable to a range of manufacturers. The process could potentially be adapted to other hard to recycle plastics.

It involves a decontamination and deodorization process that originated in Procter & Gamble’s laboratory that resulted from the company’s desire to use more recycled content in its products and packaging.

“As we were working toward this goal, we discovered that we can remove color contamination and odor from recycled plastics, which opens the door for broad uses of recycled polypropylene and, in time, other plastics like polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET),” says John Layman, section head of corporate research and development for P&G.

At scale, PureCycle will be able to process more than 105 million pounds of recycled polypropylene every year. “We put a lot of recycled content in our packaging today. And we were wanting to figure out problems involving color, odor and consumer safety,” says Layman.

This new process is a solvent-based, nonchemical one, which has been key to its efficiency. “Chemical processes are usually pyrolysis or depolymerization, meaning you are unzipping plastic molecules back to fundamental building blocks. But we purify, sort and clean using a dissolution process. It’s simpler with fewer steps using less energy to make a more competitive product,” says Layman.

PureCycle will begin a trial of the process at a plant in Ironton, Ohio, this fall and expects to have a commercial-scale facility in operation in 2020, according to Waste 360. There will be an ongoing focus on learning to adapt to changing materials, particularly evolving packaging. PureCycle has received financial backing from the Closed Loop Fund, which invests in circular economy innovations to support recycling.

Mike Otworth, CEO of PureCycle Technologies, says several suppliers and user contracts have already been lined up to provide feedstocks for the process and to buy the end products created. “I think we will see PureCycle in a host of consumer goods, probably automotive and household products of many types. And we expect it will be suitable for food contact grade resin, so I think we will see it in food packaging products,” says Otworth.

“We’d really like to see this technology become a pervasive, enabling technology in the global recycling community. We believe it will take away the limitations [posed by appearance, odor and color] associated with recycled plastics, especially post-consumer. You would be able to largely use recycled resin from any feedstock, no matter how dirty, and be able to manufacture premium products the same as you can from virgin. We’ve shown samples to potential customers. And as far as odor and appearance, it’s largely indistinguishable from virgin resin,” he says.

Kudos to Procter & Gamble for addressing the problem of plastic waste and creating a process that creates a salable end product. It says it wants to see PureCycle roll out across industries, including its competitors.

“We want this to be a force for good, to be able to produce products with greater recycling content and for applications broader than consumer goods. We’d like it to be available for industrial [manufacturers] and other end users,” John Layman says.",United States,2019.09
188,"Churchill Gowns: Robin Hood, or Robbing Us?","The University of St Andrews is known for many things: an idyllic coastal campus, its historic reputation as a world leader in education — and,are you aware that a prince studied here?

But perhaps one of the University’s most distinguishing features is its iconic red gown that adorns the backs of its undergraduates: the red gown that makes St Andrews the only university in Scotland where the gown is worn frequently in the twenty-first century and, moreover, the gown that makes St Andrews the object of envy (indeed, many an Oxfess contribution has been tinged with jealousy).

It was inevitable, then, that whilst scrolling through my phone, half watching Dragons’ Den, my attention was captured by the vibrant gown appearing upon the screen. The gown was on display as part of a presentation being given by two Cambridge grads.

Their business, known as Churchill Gowns, was looking for an investment of £60k in their company which sells university gowns, made from 100 per cent recycled materials, direct to consumer. Does the name Churchill Gowns sound familiar to you? Of course it does, as at the beginning of the last academic year, the University sent out a series of notices warning students not to purchase Churchill’s “inferior” gowns. In emails from the Students’ Association (which undoubtedly will make the rounds again this semester), the student body was informed that: “It has been brought to the University’s attention that some students have bought red gowns from a third party supplier, Churchill Gowns[…] Please note these gowns are not endorsed by the University.”

And the reason why the University is discouraging buying from third-party suppliers? According to the University, buying from third-parties “does not support the circular economy and community benefits our red gowns symbolise. ”Buying a gown from the University, in that case, supports St Andrews’ local economy, according to the Students’ Association email. But just how circular really is this circular economy? The official University shop charges a whopping £159 per undergraduate gown in comparison to the £89 price tag charged by Churchill Gowns. But if purchasing from the University puts money back into the local community, as opposed to giving money to the London-based third-party supplier, our moral compasses should guide us to buck up and fork up the extra £70. I wanted to check that the claims made by the University suggesting a boost to the local economy were accurate. In doing so, I found a FOI request from 2017 that enquired about whether the University had entered into an exclusive contract with Ede & Ravenscroft, and what commission they received.In response, the University stated that they can “confirm that as part of a public tender exercise, an award was made to Ede and Ravenscroft for academic dress hire.” As of commission rates, the University declined to disclose figures.

However, E&R’s commission rates paid to the universities can, in some cases, be as high as 20 percent per robe, allowing the universities to accrue thousands of pounds from the arrangement, alleged The Telegraph.

The apparent official supplier of St Andrews gowns was also accused by The Telegraph of driving up graduation gown costs in “anti-competitive” business practices, stating: “Ede & Ravenscroft was the subject of a complaint to the market regulator for allegedly ‘eliminating’ and‘deterring’ competition by entering into exclusive contracts with 109 universities across the country.” It thus appears that the “community benefits” referenced in the Students’ Association email, may not be as local as suggested, considering that E&R, like Churchill Gowns, is based in London.

In fact, it could appear that the University of St Andrews was willing to take more action than simply emailing its students to protect the business practices of E&R. In March of this year, the University took Churchill Gowns to court on the grounds that the company falsely suggested University endorsement. A University spokesman stated that the court proceedings were being taken as “the action is necessary to protect the integrity of the official St Andrews gown, the university brand and the principle that gown sales help student support services. ”Whilst arguing from the opposite side, Oliver Adkins, Churchill Gowns’ UK managing director, retaliated, “Participation in these ancient traditions should not be reserved for those who can afford to pay a premium, and instead should be open to all.”

However, it must be noted that the circular economy referenced in the Students’ Association email may be referencing the selling of gowns between leaving and arriving students, a practice which the University actively endorses as a means of accessing official gowns at a less costly price. Furthermore, the University responded to the criticisms raised by Churchill Gowns during the court proceedings, according to The Express, by stating that “while the red under-graduate gown is iconic within the town, there is no obligation to own a gown. ”It is also imperative to note that the commission received by the University is not merely some act of cold-hearted capitalism, but instead a means to improve our student experience with the University, stating that the proceeds from new gowns sold in the University Shop flow to the Students’ Association as well as being used to support teaching and research.

When concluding, I would also like to make it clear that I neither agree nor disagree with the University’s practices, and that I myself followed the wishes of my university and bought my gown through the official shop. The aim of this article is to pose this question to you; perhaps you don’t mind forking out the extra money at the University Shop as the money earned on commission will benefit your student experience; or perhaps you believe that all suppliers, official or not, should use 100 per cent recycled materials in gown production. Whatever your stance, the question whether we should purchase a Churchill Gown, like Churchill Gowns itself, probably isn’t going to go away soon.",United States,2019.09

192,Seven ways RMG sector can fight climate change,"The world’s attention has been focused on the UN Climate Summit in New York that ended on September 23. This significant event has brought into light the problems of climate change and is backed by many of the world’s leading organisations, which are seeking to raise awareness about the urgency to take effective actions to address this spiralling crisis.

Many of the climate issues the world is facing today are caused by global manufacturing supply chains, and the clothing and garment industry is no exception. The good news is there is plenty that the ready-made garment (RMG) manufacturers in Bangladesh can now do to cut their carbon footprints and contribute to the fight against climate change.

Here are seven steps the RMG manufacturers can take to help combat global warming:

This is probably the most urgent issue to address as we all know that greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel are one of the most significant triggers of climate change. Around the world, the electricity sector generates as much as a third of global warming emissions. Most of those emissions come from fossil fuels like coal and natural gas. In contrast, most renewable energy sources produce little or global warming emissions. Even when one includes the life cycle emissions of clean energy (such as the emissions from each stage of a technology’s life), the global warming emissions associated with renewable energy are minimal. Therefore, RMG factories should all be looking at areas of their operations where they can shift to renewable energies. There is plenty of support available for factory owners looking to go down this route and the industry has already made good progress in this area.

Not all businesses can make the shift to renewable energy overnight as investment costs for RMG factory owners can be discouraging. But even for those using non-renewable energy sources there are measures that they can take to reduce their carbon footprint. Resource efficiency upgrades—more modern boilers, for instance—can drastically cut energy consumption and reduce associated greenhouse gas emissions. More and more factory owners are now embracing energy and resource saving techniques as they recognise it is good for the environment and also has a quick ROI. For instance, if an RMG factory uses less water, via water saving techniques, this means it will require less energy to heat that water.

Trash and by-products have become a major problem in today’s culture, and this is a serious problem in the global apparel industry, particularly in supply chains. Waste that ends up in landfill produces methane which is a greenhouse gas. To reduce emissions from waste, RMG factories can look at implementing factory-wide recycling schemes. This requires business owners to think more smartly and creatively about the issue of waste—to stop seeing it as a negative and start seeing it as a resource. This leads us to our next point which is …

In line with the Climate Week, a new report has been released by the Ellen Macarthur Foundation which said that shifting to renewable energy and other energy saving resources do not do enough to tackle climate change and that the circular economy is also vitally important. This means making better use of existing waste streams by, for instance, launching recycled apparel lines—a direction some manufacturers are moving towards. A circular economy is a more efficient, which in turn is an economy that produces less CO2 emissions.

This is low hanging fruit as far as most factories are concerned. Changing lighting across a building to more energy efficient options such as LED can make a big difference; it provides a quick win, and the effects will be lasting. There are plenty of technologies available, such as sensors which automatically ensure lights are switched off if movement ceases. Dimmable light is another method to ensure lights aren’t at their brightest maximum when not required. RMG factories in Bangladesh are clearly embracing these and other energy saving techniques as the country now has the highest number of LEED accredited factories in the world.

This is actually the most important factor here—getting all your team behind these issue. Employees—senior management downwards—need to know why certain things are happening the way they are in order to cooperate and embrace more sustainable ways of working, which will have less impact on the environment. Steps need to be taken to raise awareness about sustainability issues so that the whole company and its employees are on board and have buy-in. The most sustainable businesses are those where there is a sustainability culture at the top and this permeates throughout the organisation, so that ALL the staff embrace sustainability measures and engage in what is essentially good housekeeping.

This is not an obvious step, but one which all RMG factories in Bangladesh should now be considering. Factory owners might be doing their bit, but are the businesses they purchase from doing the same? Ask questions of vendors—about the packaging they use, whether they have a sustainability strategy and whether they are taking care to reduce their impact on the environment. By rewarding vendors that take a sustainable approach, it’s possible to create a virtuous circle.

197,Supply chain players must transform operations to suit a 'circular economy',"Supply chain executives need to prepare to transform their operations from a linear to circular model, as sustainability increasingly becomes a priority for consumers and corporations alike.

According to supply chain consultancy Gartner, the economy is increasingly becoming “circular”, which it defines as “an economic model that separates the ability to achieve economic growth from the consumption of natural resources”, and which has been championed by former British solo sailor Ellen MacArthur.

“Circular economic business models encourage continuous reuse of materials to minimise waste and the demand for additional natural resource consumption,” Gartner said.

It added that this switch from linear to circular economies would take place over the next decade, and that by 2029 logistics operations would need to reflect this shift.

“Organisations are under pressure to reduce the amount of waste they’re producing — from consumers and governments alike,” said Steven Steutermann, managing vice president in Gartner’s supply chain practice.

“The solution to this challenge is a shift towards a circular, waste-free economy. The supply chain will play a key role in this process.

“84% of participants in Gartner’s recent Supply Chain and the Circular Economy survey stated that the supply chain has, or will have, decision-making authority when it comes to their organisation’s circular economy strategies and initiatives.”

However, Mr Steutermann explained that this was not a straightforward transition, and that supply chain designers needed to begin working on it now. They will additionally need to work together with “internal product designers and suppliers to understand exactly how products are consumed and disposed after consumption”.

He said: “Ten years is not a long time to turn around a supply chain system. Chief supply chain officers should deploy change management programmes and start pilots now to provide valuable learning and help build momentum for further circular economy initiatives.”

However, the Gartner survey also highlighted one of the chief challenges of the circular economy envisaged by many: how to set meaningful, measurable goals.

“While some metrics on sustainability exist, they are mostly related to linear metrics, such as reducing waste to landfills or carbon dioxide emissions,” said Mr Steutermann. “It is important not to confuse those metrics with the circular economy.

“Good metrics for the circular economy could be the percentages of reclaimed, reused materials for production and the reduction of single-use plastic.”",United States,2019.09
198,Circular Economy in the Tourism Sector | By Luciano Lopez –,"The economy was pictured until recently as linear, with a strong tendency to satisfy the consumers' needs with brand new products, somehow to give them a feeling of exclusivity. However, a full range of environmental, socio-demographic and economic indicators, mostly alarming, rose the need to change our consumption and production habits. One of the main and current issues discussed in the media is climate change, of which principal source is, according to studies, households' consumption, thus including consumption of tourism. To tackle this problem, new ways of thinking the economy appeared since few years, in particular in developed countries, and circular economy embodies most of them.

Linear vs circular economy: a very different approach

Linear economy is the current approach taken by most market economies. This strategy can simplistically be seen as the famous take-make-dispose approach. Although those three steps do not completely disappear in circular economy, they greatly lose importance.

If we still need to take (i.e. extract) resources, it has to be done in a lesser extent and obviously with a greater respect for our planet. In fact, the theoretical foundations of circular economy are more in favor of borrowing instead of taking. Economically speaking, Earth should now be included in the economic circuit as an additional economic actor (besides consumers, producers, Government, financial institutions and the rest of the World).

Circular economy does not mean the end of production - but goods and services have now to be designed to minimize resources needed, to last, to be repairable, and more importantly to be reusable or, at least recyclable. The lifespan linearity of a given product/service is considerably reduced if not totally eliminated.

""If linear economy is known as take-make-dispose, circular economy is more borrow-make&reuse-recycle.""

Although both types of economies aim at achieving the same goal, that is produce a good or service to satisfy the demand, the approach to achieve the objective is fundamentally different.

Despite the discrepancy between linear and circular economy, the way to compute economic growth has not really evolved and leads to a major macroeconomic concern. Indeed, the linear economy approach was adopted because it was probably the fastest way to produce ever more, facilitating growth (for the firm and for the economy as a whole).

Does that mean circular economy leads to the end of positive economic growth rates? This is not a trivial question. On one hand - in the new economy approach - production (in quantities) may decrease given that goods are reused, but on the other hand the goods produced may incorporate more value added to satisfy new consumption patterns.

Moreover, no matter the final outcome on growth rates; at this point it is probably wise to ask ourselves if the current method used to compute economic growth (through GDP) is appropriate. Indeed, if consumers feel better off re-using goods instead of buying new ones, if firms are better off producing less goods but with higher value added, if Earth is better off with those eco-friendly goods, then, those fundamental changes in behavior should lead to new measures of what is nowadays called economic growth.

It is easier to see how the concepts of circular economy can affect the manufacturing sectors rather than the service sectors as, for instance, the tourism industry.

Nonetheless, a link between circular economy and the tourism sector does exist. Think about what a tourist (defined by the World Tourism Organization as a person traveling and staying at least one night and less than one year to a destination outside his usual environment) does when starting his consumption of tourism.

First, he prepares his trip, then he travels. When reaching his destination, he likely uses local transports, he settles in his chosen accommodation, consumes food and partakes in some local activities. Finally, he travels back. All seven steps are compatible with circular economy.

A given destination can obviously - mostly, if not only - impact all the steps from accommodation to local activities as they take place in the destination itself. It is worth noting at this stage that migration towards circular economy is not only a producer concern. Indeed, the tourist is the one deciding how to travel, i.e. with which transportation mean and with which company, and what to do at destination.

Moreover and although it has to be admitted that the supply is still relatively lean, there are already possibilities for a consumer to consume tourism in a circular way. For instance, the Crowne Plaza in Copenhagen has a room heating system connected to the booking software. If a room is not booked, the heating is set at its minimum. This same hotel collects food waste in its basement and uses it to produce bio-gas.

The next question being, should the economic actors active in the tourism sector migrate towards circular economy?

Economically speaking, there are good reasons to believe that firms within the tourism sector have a vested interest to adapt their production process to what I like to name circular tourism.

Most of the firms in the tourism sector are in, what we call in microeconomics, monopolistic competition. In a nutshell, each firm has competitors but they have been able to differentiate from each other. Actually, the more they can differentiate themselves from their competitors, the higher the market power and therefore the bigger the potential economic profit.

Transitioning from linear to circular tourism is currently definitely a way to differentiate. Furthermore, costs for firms integrating the concepts of circular economy will not necessarily increase. Philips Lighting has shifted from selling light bulbs to offering lighting-as-a-service. In so doing, customers, including companies active in the tourism sector, save money by paying only for the light they use. This latter process is in line with the reduction of goods & services' possession (linear view) and in favor of borrowing goods & services (circular view).

Another example is DSM-Niaga which now produces 100%-recyclable carpets that use 95% less energy and no water.

Finally, it is said that 60% of food that is thrown away currently in the tourism sector can be relatively easily avoided. Thus, a hotel or restaurant aiming at producing zero waste increases already its chances to survive the coming years. If the transition towards circular economy is wisely done, costs do not necessarily increase. Moreover, even if costs slightly increase, they will undoubtedly be offset by the higher turnover the firm will be able to make (since they differentiate even more they may be able to set a higher price and, additionally, the total demand for goods and services in line with circular economy increases).

In the long run, as competitors will adapt to also comply with circular tourism, prices will probably slightly decrease and the economic profit potentially lower down. However, and even if economic profits arising from the shift towards circular tourism may decrease a bit with time, not adapting to the new models of consumption will lead to its business death, at least in the long run. Indeed, the news concerning the climate show it well, very soon consumers may not accept anymore to consume goods & services unhealthy for our planet.

Little by little, as most of the Fortune 500 companies are now service oriented, most industrialized countries are shifting from goods to services economies. Tourism is a prime example of a service oriented sector. Consumers' habits are changing fast. In Switzerland, the consumption of organic products has increased by 50% in only five years. The great emergence of sharing economy companies (Airbnb, Couchsurfing, Uber, etc.) is an additional proof of the radical change in consumers' habits. If the current firms active in the tourism sector do not adapt to those new trends and consumers' desires, there is little hope they will survive.

Changes to set up do not necessarily need to be radical, the ultimate goal being to show the consumers that their desires are seriously considered and that efforts are undertook to satisfy them. The quicker the actors will adapt, the smoother will be the transition towards circular tourism.

Many examples on how the tourism industry can adopt the circular economy concepts can be found in a handbook published by the Centre for Regional and Tourism Research, Denmark (Manniche et al. 2017) and aiming at providing the South Baltic Region concrete solutions to move from the linear to the circular economy. In light of this handbook and the recent literature it can be stated with certitude that circular economy can be applied to the tourism sector.",United States,2019.09

205,‘Small format plastic lids must be eliminated from the beverage chain’,"The university announced the publication of the document​ ‘Circular Packaging Design Guideline’ in a post​ on its website in January developed by the university’s Competence Center for Sustainable and Future Oriented Packaging Solutions​.

Dr Ernst Krottendorfer, lecturer, University of Applied Sciences, Vienna and MD, Packforce, Austria, talked about the document which explains the basics of sustainable packaging design and gives recommendations on creating recyclable design variants at the ECMA Congress in Malta this month (September 19-20).

The guideline has been created in close cooperation with material producers, packaging converters, consumer goods companies, retailers, collection systems and recycling companies and its objective is to give information and instructions on how to design recyclable packaging.

The university has published the first version​ of the document, and it will be updated in the future to reflect changes in collection, sorting, and recycling technology as well as the development of new materials.

The university plans to hold a Circular Packaging Day on April 11, 2019, focusing on current aspects within the EU Circular Economy Package evaluation of recyclability, and the latest recycling and packaging technology.

“Problems such as small formats like lids, must be eliminated ie beverage bottles must not have lids that fall off and they must be attached to the bottle and more innovation is needed on multi materials which allow for separate layers​,” said Krottendorfer.

“Uncommon materials that are appearing in small qualities such as PVC, EPS, PS, and nutrient contaminated packaging that has residues of food need to be eliminated as well as coffee capsules which are difficult to recycle, organic waste bags and takeaway food packaging​.”

Krottendorfer said the European Union has now launched a calculation​ tool on the recyclability of plastics​ for the period 2025 to 2030 and these include;
• Asking Member States to report to the Commission data on the implementation of the recycling targets for each calendar year in accordance with a format established by the Commission.
• Commission Decision 2005/270/EC should be amended to bring provisions in line with the rules in Directive 94/62/EC as regards the calculation of the attainment of the targets, regarding reusable sales packaging.
• Only waste that enters a recycling operation or waste that has achieved end of waste status should be used for the calculation of the recycling target.

Krottendorfer presented his recommendations about how packaging needs to be designed to be recycled at the WPO (World Packaging Organisation) week in Prague​ (May 13-17), with Antro Säilä, VP, Sustainability,

He explained how the Circular Economy Package of the European Union forces much higher recycling rates for packaging, where it wants to close material and product cycles for packaging.

With the release of the Circular Economy Package, the European Union will target improving the efficient use of materials and reducing the resource dependency of Europe. It has also issued new rules for packaging and packaging waste, increasing the recycling rate requirements as of 2025.

“These new rules represent a substantial increase in the recycling rates for all packaging materials starting 2025 with 65% until reaching a minimum of 70% in 2030​,” said Krottendorfer.

“Plastic packaging has to get at a recycling rate of 55% until 2030 and all plastic packaging needs to be recyclable 100% in 2030.​

“There will be a regulation for a minimum recycling content in plastic bottles for beverages and the placement of market restrictions of specific single use plastics​.”

He added, basic prerequisite for the implementation is circular packaging design. To achieve this, circular packaging design is essential to fulfill the targets of recyclability.

The definition of recyclability includes the need for a dedicated collection system, and for packaging materials to be separable and sortable. To avoid downcycling, recyclates must be used for the same or similar purposes than the basic product.

Investment in recycling capacity and infrastructure is necessary to make the circular economy work. Recyclability defines a packaging system that can be recycled in a state-of-the-art packaging waste system on an industrial scale.

The guideline in its current form is valid for Austria and Germany. It has also designed a holistic assessment of packaging sustainability to monitor packaging developments and to facilitate packaging design.

The recyclability of a packaging system depends on the technical capabilities and the recycling infrastructure in a given country. Recyclability differs from country to country. This is a major hurdle for international consumer goods companies and retailers who have to design products and packaging for an international market and these companies and their suppliers and customers need additional information on the recycling infrastructure on an international level.

To support the international development of packaging, Packforce wants to internationalise the Circular Packaging Design Guideline. Initially, it is targeting the European market and special issues will be developed for - North Europe (Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland), - Central Eastern Europe (Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Croatia, Slovenia), - Western Europe (UK, France, Italy, Spain, Switzerland).

Packforce is looking for partners in these respective countries, who can contribute in a first step information regarding the collections systems and recycling infrastructure.",United States,2019.09
206,"Robots are ready to sort our trash, but will VCs be interested in the messy world of recycling?","This story is featured in the 3Q 2019 issue of the PitchBook Private Market PlayBook You finish a greasy-yet-satisfying lunch at the cafeteria, pick up the items from the table and walk to the trash and recycling bins. Like most well-intentioned people, you face a familiar dilemma. Used napkins. Leftover ketchup packets. A foam container. Wait, there's food stuck on it. Where do they all go? Is anyone watching? Help.We've all been there. And our three-second plight is part of an expensive problem that's only piling up by the minute.China took the world by surprise last year when it started banning imports on dozens of kinds of solid waste, including some plastics and other recyclables. The maximum acceptable contamination level in plastics and fiber also dropped to 0.5% in China, making it nearly impossible for recycling facilities around the world to quickly process sizable volumes of scrap.The impact of those changes has been devastating, and for many private waste management companies in the US, plastic recycling is no longer a viable market. Like any other business, a recycling company needs to efficiently use available resources and have a healthy bottom line. The soaring cost of recycling has forced many local governments across the US and recycling processors to send increasing amounts of waste to landfills or incinerators.Even in this dire situation, many environmentalists and entrepreneurs believe there's a silver lining. China's bold move has forced countries throughout the world to acknowledge green issues and push innovative recycling ideas toward tangible and long-term investments.While humans could single-handedly choke our planet with waste, we may need some help to clean up the mess. Enter the robots.One of the crucial steps in contributing toward a circular economy begins with correctly classifying what can and cannot be recycled. Even something as straightforward as a coffee cup could be complicated during disposal. Its light-weight plastic lid, paper cup and cardboard holder may appear to be recyclable components, but rules might be different for a sorting facility if it's made of virgin tree fiber rather than paper or if it's contaminated with leftover whipped cream.Charles Yhap, who co-founded CleanRobotics in 2015, realized there might be a better way to sort trash than to expect high levels of awareness, accuracy and motivation from human beings—especially when recycling laws can be confusing and vary from county to county. The Pittsburgh-based company has developed an AI-powered robot called TrashBot that helps automate the separation process at the point of disposal.""The idea was born out of frustration, of being confronted with an array of trash bins,"" Yhap told PitchBook. ""Waste management processes are either dirty, dull or dangerous, and it makes sense to target robotics in this industry.""TrashBot uses cameras and sensors to scan discarded items from everyday waste—and that doesn't mean it conveniently tosses an unfinished can of soda straight to the bin bound for the landfill. These robots can ""swallow"" excess liquids. CleanRobotics is focusing on high-traffic facilities such as airports, convention centers and schools, but one challenge is its technology requires waste to be thrown away one item at a time with a short delay in between. The company is backed by investors including GAN Ventures, SOSV and Innovation Works.Another player in this niche segment is AMP Robotics, which has launched an AI-enabled robotic system that can pick recyclable materials off a conveyor belt and toss them into a collection bin. Matanya Horowitz, who founded the Denver-area business in 2015, said that for the longest time, the problem in sorting trash was not the lack of robots, but the lack of a vision system that could see past complicated packaging.Horowitz said the company's technology can identify not just the material type but the stock-keeping unit of a product, which is unique for all manufactured items. Once the SKU has been added to the database, it's more likely that the robot will identify the item moving forward. This also provides flexibility to help the recycling facility follow local regulations.""The situation with the Chinese market has actually been good for us in the short term. It is allowing the US to think about domestic manufacturing,"" said Horowitz, whose company has raised funding from investors including Baidu Ventures, Closed Loop Partners and Congruent Ventures.It's not just a couple of buzzy startups making headlines for increased efficiency to sort trash. Researchers at MIT announced in April that they've developed a robotic platform called RoCycle that can sort various items by touch. It uses sensors to determine the size and makeup of waste materials such as paper, plastic and metal.VC investors in the US don't appear to be as enthusiastic about recycling startups helping the environment as much as they are about, let's say, electric vehicles. Some of the biggest cleantech VC deals in the past year have gone to Zoox, a developer of autonomous mobility technology, and ChargePoint, the creator of a charging network for electric vehicles.""VCs got burned by cleantech in the 1990s when they invested in solar energy and batteries. Several folks lost a lot of money,"" Yhap said. ""That might be one of the reasons why they are apprehensive about cutting checks toward the waste industry, which is really unsexy to begin with.""If even some recycling companies have determined that burning garbage or filling up landfills is better business right now than recycling, it seems hard to blame returns-focused venture capitalists for not being overly excited about the space. And even if VCs are dazzled by a cool robotic arm using AI to sort our trash, it will take some time before mega-deals in this space are warranted.It's a fair argument that deploying robots to sort trash is only part of the solution and creating recycled products isn't the only way to fix the plastic crisis, but in order to help build a circular economy, let's focus on the idea of applying automation in waste management for now.If the development of a mainstream industry vertical can be classified into three stages—define and systematize the process, automate repetitive tasks and increase production to attain economies of scale—it seems the waste management industry is only beginning to enter the second phase. Yhap said there's a whole stack of value that can be created with combining automation AI, vision and robotic systems—ranging from deploying robots to sort trash, collecting data to manage hazardous items and creating cloud-based platforms to track waste across multiple locations.The development of breakthrough technologies from startups is a fine start, and we can hope it's only a matter of time before they establish end-to-end solutions to reduce the cost of recycling. However, these companies might need VCs to cross that bridge. According to a recent analysis by Closed Loop Partners—which invests in sustainable consumer goods, advanced recycling technologies and startups working toward building a circular economy—there's an existing $120 billion addressable market in the US and Canada for plastics and petrochemicals that could be met, in part, by recovering waste plastics.Investors should keep an eye on the numbers behind all that rubbish because technological advancements, regulatory adjustments and climate change could push startups to scale their operations in a big way. And if VCs make the right bet now, the payoff could be enormous. Who knows, we all might eventually thank China for forcing one of the leading waste-producing countries in the world to face its broken system.",United States,2019.09

214,The climate crisis requires the fashion industry to transform,"H&M Group wants to take the momentum of the climate debate to put the focus on the importance of having joint strategies to address the impact on climate while transforming the business into a circular economy.

NEW YORK, Sept. 25, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- The climate crisis requires companies such as H&M Group to take a stand and act on their impact on climate. Our ambition to become climate positive by 2040 through energy efficiency, investments in renewable energy and climate resilience, is one example of how our climate priority in our sustainability agenda has developed with clearer roadmaps and goals.

We are not far from achieving our goal to only use renewable electricity in our own operations, which stands for 96% today, or reducing the energy used per square meter by 25% before 2030. But working on energy transition and energy efficiency is not enough if a broader perspective to the business is not taken.

Completing the picture: how the circular economy tackles climate change. A report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation

The latest report from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation raises precisely the need of having energy transition and energy efficiency strategies in place. But also, not being enough. These strategies address 55% of the industry's total emissions, while the 45% rest comes from how we manage land, produce and consume products. That is why applying circular economy solutions go hand in hand with taking action on business impact on the climate.

""The fashion industry will not exist in the future if we continue producing and using fashion in the same way. Climate crisis requires us to take great steps to transform our whole industry. This report clearly shows how shifting to a circular economy and treating waste as a resource enable us to drastically reduce our footprint and reach our goal to become climate positive,"" says Anna Gedda, Head of Sustainability H&M Group.

The report argues that ""putting in place a circular economy is a fundamental step towards achieving climate targets. Such a shift moves us beyond efforts to minimize emissions in our extractive linear system. It offers a systematic response to the crisis by both reducing emissions and increasing resilience to its effects. The benefits encompass meeting other goals such as creating more livable cities, distributing value more widely in the economy, and spurring innovation. These attributes make the circular economy a potent contributor to achieving zero-carbon prosperity.""

As climate crisis is not something a company can address on its own, especially when we share complex global supply chains, industry-wide collaboration within policy makers, business, investors and academia plays a critical role.
• 20.6 tonnes of old garments were collected through our instore garment collecting initiative so we could give them a second life by reusing or recycling them. The goal is to collect 25t per year by 2020.
• 57% of all our materials are either recycled or sourced in a more sustainable way. The goal is to achieve 100% by 2030.
• 96% of all the energy used in our own operations is renewable. The goal is to achieve 100%.
• We reduced by 8.2% the energy used per square meter. The goal is to reduce by 25% by 2030, having 2017 as baseline.
• We reduced carbon emissions by 11% in our own operations. The goal is to achieve a carbon neutral supply chain by 2030.

216,Ecopreneur: ‘Strong policies needed to meet climate goals’,"About 50 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions are related to materials and the manufacturing of products. Strong circular economy policies are therefore needed to meet the climate goals, according to Ecopreneur.eu, which has worked out far-reaching proposals as input for the EU Green Deal.

Manfred Mühlberger, Chair of Ecopreneur, the European Sustainable Business Federation, said: “A huge share of global greenhouse gas emissions are released during the extraction and processing of raw materials and the manufacturing of goods. We therefore need to fundamentally change the way we design, manufacture and use products and materials.”

Executive Director Arthur ten Wolde added: “Ecopreneur.eu has worked out far-reaching policy recommendations to accelerate and mainstream the circular economy, that can take EU industry about halfway towards net-zero emissions.”

Comprehensive eco-design for product longevity, maintenance, repair and sharing is key to increase the product life-time and reduce materials consumption. Importantly, circular economy practices include moving from waste incineration to recycling, and substituting virgin materials with high embedded emissions by recycled materials.

Key measures are financial incentives such as extended producer responsibility, low VAT, and a tax shift from labour to resources, sending clear price signals to the market.

Circular procurement is also needed to increase the demand for circular products and services. Together with targeted innovation policies and programmes, regulation, trade policies and voluntary actions, this can create a circular framework and create millions of jobs, according to Ecopreneur.

217,Ellen MacArthur Foundation says greener plastics needed to meet Paris climate goals,"Improving the environmental footprint for materials industries — plastics as well as steel, aluminum, cement and even food production — is crucial to achieving global climate goals, according to a new report from the United Kingdom-based Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

The foundation said in its Sept. 23 report, ""Completing the Picture: How the Circular Economy Tackles Climate Change,"" that greener production of materials in those industries could help the world achieve 45 percent of the greenhouse gas emission reductions needed to meet United Nations climate goals.

In effect, the report says that switching all energy to renewables will not be enough. It would only get 55 percent of the way to meeting the 2050 net zero emissions goals of the Paris Agreement.

More environmental production methods would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 9.3 billion metric tons annually by 2050, equivalent to eliminating the current emissions from all forms of transportation, it said.

""Switching to renewable energy plays a vital role in addressing climate change, but this alone will not be enough,"" said Ellen MacArthur, founder of the group. ""In order to achieve targets on climate, it is critical that we transform how we design, make, and use products and food.""

The Paris Agreement says net zero emissions are needed to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5º C.

The four materials industries that the report focuses on — cement, steel, plastics and aluminum — account for 60 percent of emissions from industry, which overall is responsible for 21 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.

The foundation said switching to greener methods of making cars, clothes, food and other products is an opportunity for industry.

""Carbon constraints actually represent huge ingenuity opportunities,"" said Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in a statement released by the foundation. ""This report offers compelling figures to give confidence in our ability to optimize decarbonization and economic development in mutual support of each other.""

The report gave some specific examples of how switching production methods for plastics could reduce carbon emissions.

It said, for example, that using renewable feedstocks for items such as bio-based plastics has the potential to bind carbon in products or in effect become a carbon sink.

While 1.8 kilograms of carbon dioxide is released to make each kg of fossil-fuel based polyethylene, the report said making a kg of bio-based polyethylene has the potential for negative emissions, in effect reducing 2.2 kg of carbon dioxide emissions per kg of bio-based PE.

As well, it said recycling 1 metric ton of plastics can reduce CO2 emissions by 1.1-3 tonnes compared with producing the same amount of virgin plastics.

""The use of recycled materials reduces the demand for virgin materials, while the processing of recycled aggregates can generate 40-70 percent fewer CO2 emissions compared to virgin aggregates,"" the report said.

It said that reusing recycled materials could remove 1.7 billion tonnes of CO2 per year by 2050, with the report assuming a 28 percent recycling rate for plastics overall from mechanical processes and 21 percent from chemical recycling.",United States,2019.09
219,Predicts Circular Economies Will Replace Linear Economies in 10 Years,"Switching from a linear to a circular economy is not a go-it-alone project — it requires a whole ecosystem. CSCOs should collaborate with internal product designers and suppliers to understand exactly how products are consumed and disposed after consumption.

“To turn around a supply chain system, 10 years is not a long time. CSCOs should deploy change management programs and start pilots now,” added Mr. Steutermann. “The pilots will provide valuable learnings and help build momentum for further circular economy initiatives.”

Another action to take is to join a consortium or alliance, such as Make Fashion Circular, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste or Loop, an online shopping concept designed to eliminate single-use packaging. “Getting together with like-minded professionals will support CSCOs to sketch out a vision for an intelligent ecosystem of partners and peers,” Mr. Steutermann added. “They should start with a single question, such as ‘How can I reduce packaging?’, and expand from there.”

New Metrics for New Economies

According to the survey, the biggest challenge to circular-economy efforts is setting measurable goals. Often, the key challenge in setting these goals — as with any transformational initiative — is substantiating how the proposed changes will impact consumer preferences and, ultimately, margins.

“While some metrics on sustainability already exist, they are mostly related to linear metrics, such as reducing waste to landfills or carbon dioxide emissions. It is important not to confuse those metrics with the circular economy. Good metrics for the circular economy could be the percentages of reclaimed, reused materials for production and the reduction of single-use plastic,” Mr. Steutermann concluded.

226,[Video] Giving Old Products New Life,"The lack of an efficient means for recycling plastic waste on a large scale is a pressing concern that’s starting to take a serious toll on the environment.

According to a 2016 report from the World Economic Forum (WEF), research suggests that by the year 2050, there may be more plastic (by weight) in the ocean than fish.1 The use of plastics, the WEF notes, “has increased twentyfold in the past half-century, and is expected to double again in the next 20 years.”

Recently, Samsung Newsroom spotlighted eco-friendly initiatives that Samsung Electronics has undertaken as part of its decades-long commitment to sustainable innovation. Here, we’ll outline the company’s efforts to combat e-waste and promote a circular economy by recycling resources safely and efficiently.

E-waste recycling is a complicated process that involves disassembling or shredding old devices to recover useful resources. To help simplify the first step of the process, collecting e-waste, in 1998, Samsung Electronics initiated a take-back and recycling program in Korea. Now known as the Re+ Program, this free service, which lets consumers dispose of old smartphones and appliances by dropping them off at Samsung stores and service centers, was up and running in a total of 54 countries.2

Once a smartphone has been collected, its battery is removed and processed separately. Rather than burning the battery, as is common when electronic devices are discarded, Samsung will instead dispose of the battery safely and in an eco-friendly manner. The smartphone batteries go through four processing phases in all, which include salting, perforation, drying and fragmentation stages. Any cobalt, nickel or other rare metals that are extracted during processing are set aside for use in new products.

Once an old appliance has been collected and transferred to a recycling facility, it’s put through a preconditioning phase that helps ensure that it’s processed efficiently. Here, any devices that would decrease in value if they were subjected to the first stage of the recycling process, which involves crushing the devices to extract resources such as steel, copper, aluminum and plastic, are separated from the rest.

After the devices have been pulverized, an automated procedure sorts the extracted resources by type. The post-processing required to transform these resources into raw materials is completed not at the recycling facility itself, but at offsite smelting firms.

As part of its commitment to creating a circular economy, Samsung Electronics has established an increased use of recycled plastic as one of its mid- to long-term goals. The hope is to utilize what amounts to 500,000 tons of recycled plastic by 2030. Since 2009, approximately 220,000 tons2 of recycled plastic have been used to create new products. Recycled plastic is not only difficult and expensive to process, it’s also known to be hard to use because the quality of the final product varies more widely than with metals.

Youngjin Seo, Director of Samsung Electronics’ Product Environment Team, shed some light on the importance of these recycling efforts from a business standpoint. “Recycling plastic from discarded devices not only helps reduce e-waste, it also reduces the amount of petrochemicals needed to produce new products,” Seo explained. “This is why resource circulation is especially important to businesses.”

You can watch the recycling process in action in the video below. See how a device – in this case, a refrigerator – is collected and broken down at a recycling facility, and how plastic is extracted and reprocessed for use in new devices.

229,Circular cities of the world: what can green infrastructure do?,"More than half of the world’s population currently lives in cities while projections show an increase to two thirds by 2050. Many people living in small areas means large amounts of waste, high resource consumption and loads of energy use. We can combat these issues with the ideas behind the circular economy. If we were to envision our cities as circular cities, how would they look? Green. And why? Because achieving a circular economy means using nature as a template. With the help of green infrastructure, we can take nature as the example and transform our cities into circular cities.

Achieving a circular city means ensuring the mitigation of waste. Green infrastructure reduces waste in the construction industry by increasing the longevity of exterior surfaces. With greening, roofs survive longer against harmful weathering and intense sunlight. The lifespan of conventional flat roofs can even be doubled with greening. As one city with a long tradition of greening roofs, Berlin even has green roofs reaching approximately 100 years in age.

Green facades also play a similar role by reducing the maintenance requirements of conventional facades due to the protective layer against sunlight and high temperatures. By using these nature-inspired measures in green infrastructure, cities reduce waste in the construction industry and become more circular. Making our buildings last longer means less waste and helps us approach the idea of circular cities.

China’s “sponge city” initiative helps cities absorb rainwater, reduce flooding, ease pressures on municipal treatment systems and increase their water supply. Recycling runoff mimics nature’s own circular way of dealing with rainwater, offering a cleaner and more holistic approach for growing cities.

Berlin’s Potsdamer Platz is another prime example. Rather than a sponge system, the urban pools take advantage of an interconnected system of green roofs, urban spaces and a constructed treatment pond to recycle and filter excess stormwater for irrigation and indoor plumbing.

Considering the numerous benefits, it is clear that cities investing in green infrastructure become more circular and tackle several issues at once. Studies have already shown how economically the benefits do outweigh the costs of such systems, and it is obvious that there is much to gain in mimicking nature and transitioning to circular cities of the world.

230,Companies back circular economy at eco innovation forum,"Bangkok – The Ministry of Industry, the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand, the Water and Environment Institute for Sustainability, and the Federation of Thai Industries have held the Eco Innovation Forum 2019 on the theme ‘The Economy: Way to a Smart and Sustainable Eco Industrial Town’.

Exhibitions on eco industrial town development were held in the forum by government agencies, entrepreneurs, and educational institutions. Some 200 Eco Factory awards were given to winning industrial estates and factories.

An Advisor to the Minister of Industry, Theerayut Wanitchang said the Ministry of Industry has clear goals to encourage OTOP entrepreneurs and SMEs to adopt the Bio Economy, Circular Economy, and Green Economy or BCG Model in their operations.

The Ministry of Industry and the Federation of Thai Industries have signed an agreement on the Factory 4.0 industry development model through the BLISS Project, aimed at maximizing added value from limited resources, by designing products that encourage recycling, promote innovations and help efficiently reduce resource and energy consumption in an environmentally friendly manner.

The eco industrial city project was piloted in Ban Chang, Rayong, to support future industrial development in the Eastern Economic Corridor, and to promote proper electronic waste processing.

The Ministry of Industry is expected to turn all industrial estates in Thailand into eco industrial cities fully engaged in the Circular Economy by 2021.",United States,2019.09
231,"Color, care, clarity keywords at K 2019 for Milliken","Milliken Chemical will use its presence at the K 2019 show to demonstrate the many ways in which it is enhancing plastics with color, care, clarity, and performance. “Waste reduction and the recycling of plastics are necessary megatrends impacting today’s consumer products sector,” notes Herrin Hood, global product line manager of Milliken’s Plastics Additives business. “As we all work to limit excess plastics use, support the recycling of polypropylene and move toward a circular economy, Milliken is fully supporting these efforts with sustainable technological innovations that impact color, care, clarity, and performance.”

Milliken (Hall 6/A27) has partnered with US company PureCycle Technologies to advance closed-loop recycling of polypropylene (PP) resin. Using technology developed and licensed by Procter & Gamble Co., PureCycle plans to open in Ohio by 2021 its first plant employing a patented recycling method that restores virgin-like quality to waste PP resin. This will enable the recycled material to become truly circular and be reused in its original application, as opposed to having to be downcycled into lower-value products.

Milliken also is continuing to forge additional partnerships with other global sustainability organizations with a goal to advancing circular-economy initiatives. Several of Milliken’s additive technologies are helping converters to manufacture more sustainably by reducing energy use, enabling the use of more mono-material packaging solutions, and promoting the recyclability of resins such as polypropylene or the use of a higher percentage of recycled PP in end products.

“Milliken has clear priorities to help create a circular economy for plastics,” Hood added. “Improving the recyclability of plastics for our customers, replacing single-use plastics with durable reusable plastics, and increasing the use of biopolymers by developing products that boost performance and aesthetic properties will help create a more sustainable plastics industry as we work to create a positive impact on the world.”

Milliken’s Millad NX 8000 clarifier for PP resin is a key component in nearly 80 percent of the world’s clear PP today, not only transforming PP into a lightweight, crystal-clear alternative to glass, but also boosts its sustainability by enabling converters to process the material at a lower temperature, resulting in both faster cycle times and energy savings for injection molders. Grades are available that have been optimized for various processes, including injection molding, thermoforming and blow molding.

LED penetration of the global industrial lighting market is projected to surpass 50 percent this year from virtually zero just a decade ago. Various performance factors are driving this shift, which has implications for the visual impact of plastics packaging on store shelves. Milliken is working with a leading global lighting supplier to better understand trends that affect the appearance of packaging and how it can address these implications with additive solutions.

Additionally, brand owners who use the NX UltraClear PP resin can display a UL Environmental Claim Validation (ECV) label on their injection-molded packaging to illustrate their dedication toward a circular economy and toward the all-important aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These proven benefits are driving strong demand for the additive, prompting Milliken to build a world-class clarifier plant its largest such facility ever in Blacksburg, South Carolina, that will boost Millad NX 8000 capacity by approximately 50 percent when it opens in 2020.

By enabling clear, transparent, Millad NX 8000-modified PP to replace alternative materials, brand owners and converters improve their options for producing more recyclable, mono-material products (for example, bottle or container, plus label and cap all in PP). Polypropylene is also lighter weight, has reportedly been shown to have a better recycling score than either PET or polystyrene, and additionally offers the possibility of closing the loop from NX UltraClear PP to NX UltraClear PP using PureCycle’s innovative, new recycling process.

Several Milliken additives serve to improve the performance of the polymers they modify, including Hyperform HPN nucleating agents for both PP and polyethylene. Hyperform HPN improves the performance of recycled polypropylene (rPP). It enables the production of stronger, lighter parts, increasing stiffness significantly when compared to conventionally nucleated PP. It also aids in processing productivity and offers balanced and tunable properties.

At K 2019, Milliken will be introducing its latest grade, Hyperform HPN 715, which will offer new opportunities for PP to replace more-expensive engineering resins in demanding applications. Hyperform HPN 715 delivers an optimized balance of various key factors, while also providing higher heat-deflection temperatures compared to other advanced nucleators. This allows PP to be used in microwaveable containers, under-hood vehicle components and in household appliance parts.

Milliken’s DeltaMax performance modifiers for PP, meanwhile, help contribute to a circular economy by enhancing the impact strength and flow properties of rPP resins, blends and polypropylene impact copolymers (ICPs). At K 2019, Milliken plans to introduce the latest addition to its DeltaMax family.

The DeltaMax melt-flow modifier can raise melt flow by as much as five times while maintaining impact and stiffness properties. This allows converters to increase operating efficiencies and create more innovative part designs with easier flow through molds. DeltaMax technology is also highly effective in modifying post-consumer and post-industrial recycled resins. It elevates impact strength and melt flow to the same levels as or better than those of virgin resin. This enables compounders and converters to incorporate up to 100 percent recycled PP without sacrificing performance or processing.",United States,2019.09
232,The climate crisis requires the fashion industry to transform,"NEW YORK, Sept. 25, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- The climate crisis requires companies such as H&M Group to take a stand and act on their impact on climate. Our ambition to become climate positive by 2040 through energy efficiency, investments in renewable energy and climate resilience, is one example of how our climate priority in our sustainability agenda has developed with clearer roadmaps and goals.

We are not far from achieving our goal to only use renewable electricity in our own operations, which stands for 96% today, or reducing the energy used per square meter by 25% before 2030. But working on energy transition and energy efficiency is not enough if a broader perspective to the business is not taken.

Completing the picture: how the circular economy tackles climate change. A report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation

The latest report from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation raises precisely the need of having energy transition and energy efficiency strategies in place. But also, not being enough. These strategies address 55% of the industry's total emissions, while the 45% rest comes from how we manage land, produce and consume products. That is why applying circular economy solutions go hand in hand with taking action on business impact on the climate.

""The fashion industry will not exist in the future if we continue producing and using fashion in the same way. Climate crisis requires us to take great steps to transform our whole industry. This report clearly shows how shifting to a circular economy and treating waste as a resource enable us to drastically reduce our footprint and reach our goal to become climate positive,"" says Anna Gedda, Head of Sustainability H&M Group.

The report argues that ""putting in place a circular economy is a fundamental step towards achieving climate targets. Such a shift moves us beyond efforts to minimize emissions in our extractive linear system. It offers a systematic response to the crisis by both reducing emissions and increasing resilience to its effects. The benefits encompass meeting other goals such as creating more livable cities, distributing value more widely in the economy, and spurring innovation. These attributes make the circular economy a potent contributor to achieving zero-carbon prosperity.""

As climate crisis is not something a company can address on its own, especially when we share complex global supply chains, industry-wide collaboration within policy makers, business, investors and academia plays a critical role.
• 20.6 tonnes of old garments were collected through our instore garment collecting initiative so we could give them a second life by reusing or recycling them. The goal is to collect 25t per year by 2020.

235,Council Post: The Circular Economy Makes Way For The Circular City,"Today, half of the world’s population lives in cities. By 2050, that number is expected to increase to two-thirds. More people living in condensed areas means higher amounts of waste, higher resource consumption and higher energy use. As the world’s cities already emit over 70% of carbon emissions, exacerbating the climate crisis, cities need to implement green infrastructure to meet these challenges.

In response to these issues, some city planners and developers have started to become inspired by the circular economy. Circular economies seek to redefine growth through society-wide benefits, incorporating environmentally friendly practices that include minimizing waste and pollution, capitalizing on sustainable resources and the regeneration of natural systems. The goal is to achieve sustainability through renewable resources and zero waste.

These same ideas can be applied to the design of cities and infrastructure, too. In fact, some major cities are already starting to incorporate more natural and sustainable initiatives to combat waste and unsustainable policies. NYC and Copenhagen are among the list of urban hubs applying circular economy tactics to the urban environment, earning them the apt title of “circular cities.” I'm proud to be a part of this trend, too — as president of a New York condominium, my building is the nation's tallest residence with a solar array, which supplements power to residents and reduces our carbon output by over 125,000 pounds annually. We have also gone through green upgrades including sensors that allow for savings on energy and a reduction in greenhouse emissions.

For cities and properties that intend to stay livable into the foreseeable future, these circular operations are quickly becoming less of an option and more of a necessity. Without them, high waste volume and unsustainable resource consumption threaten to destroy the environment and the very cities we live in.

Designing a truly circular city means building infrastructure that minimizes the negative effects on human health and the environment and solves numerous problems, including stormwater management, heat stress and pollution. Traditional roofs and exteriors are problematic from this perspective because they allow oil, pesticides, chemicals and even animal waste to simply flow freely into waterways, causing pollution and increasing the chances of human infection.

But green roofs and facades — completely or partially vegetated roofs and building exteriors constructed on top of layers of soil and waterproof filters — include drainage and irrigation systems that are crucial to a circular city’s ability to mitigate that waste. Green roofs absorb a significant amount of rainwater, helping to mitigate overflow-induced toxin spills. Plus, green roofs last longer and are proven to divert waste from landfills by saving on HVAC maintenance costs.

While roofs and facades can play a key role in the management of toxic stormwater, they mainly recycle water to feed gardens and save on utility bills. Other infrastructure projects can also manage and recycle toxic runoff, but for a different cause: using stormwater to improve the water supply for municipal and citizen needs like offering clean water for flushing toilets or even drinking.

In this case, green infrastructure acts like a sponge, absorbing and reducing the amount of contaminated runoff into natural bodies of water and redirecting it to be recycled for community purposes.

Brooklyn’s “sponge park” is cleaning up the long-polluted Gowanus Canal using a special soil that absorbs and filters runoff through a series of screens that then release the purified excess into waterways and water systems. Similarly, China’s “sponge city” initiative helps cities absorb rainwater, reduce flooding, ease pressures on municipal treatment systems and increase their water supply. Recycling runoff mimics nature’s own circular way of dealing with rainwater, offering a cleaner and more holistic approach for growing cities.

Berlin’s Potsdamer Platz is another prime example. Rather than a sponge system, the urban pools take advantage of an interconnected system of green roofs, urban spaces and a constructed treatment pond to recycle and filter excess stormwater for irrigation and indoor plumbing. Another project, Bo01 Development in Malmö, Sweden, handles and treats all stormwater to power a system that creates 100% renewable energy. Using stormwater to power buildings and supply water lets cities and property owners reduce fossil fuels and save money.

To curb emissions that contribute to climate change, cities must also curb their energy usage. In the United States, 40% of total energy consumption comes from buildings, which emit over one-third of global greenhouse gases. However, one study found that green buildings use, on average, 30% less energy than conventional ones.

The same green roofs and facades used to mitigate toxic rainwater also protect against extreme temperatures, both reducing heat (and the need for air conditioning) in the summer and increasing temperatures in the winter so citizens can save energy and limit carbon emissions. A green roof even reduces summer energy demands by 75%. Additionally, renewable energies employed by green buildings can cut 90% of energy-related carbon emissions rates.

Today, over 100 global cities boast a 70% carbon-free green energy plan. Some, like Chicago, are making commitments to reach 100% by 2035. Other cities like NYC are stepping up their game with green roof legislation, requiring certain buildings to outfit their roofs with vegetation and renewable materials like solar panels.

While no city is fully circular yet, the most forward-thinking city planners and developers are increasingly using green designs in their infrastructure projects. With the climate crisis looming, now is the time for us all to support circular initiatives, assessing and updating aging infrastructure with green resources. If cities proactively use circular infrastructure to limit waste, save energy and improve their resources, we could protect our cities and their growing populations — before it’s too late.",United States,2019.09
236,Circular economy: Europe strives to close the loop,"Under the current European Commission, the idea of a “circular economy” – zero-waste, where the output of one process is recycled into the input of another – has rocketed up the list of political priorities. Since 2014, new directives have emerged to oblige member states to increase waste recycling, ban single-use plastics, enable fertilisers to be converted into organic produce, and more.

According to Jyrki Katainen, the Commission’s vice president for jobs, growth, investment and competitiveness, the journey has just begun. At a recent Science|Business conference in Brussels, he argued that circular economy and artificial intelligence are the two main global “megatrends” which will reshape our societies, markets and industries.

Despite recent achievements, the scale of the challenge ahead is considerable. “The biggest source of frustration comes from the fact that less than 12 percent of materials used in the EU are recycled,” said Katainen, hoping that percentage will grow much faster in the next five years.

To achieve this, Katainen called on the new Commission, which takes office 1 November, to involve more stakeholders when shaping strategies and regulations for the circular economy, since the biggest drivers behind the circular economy are in the private sector. “You have to do change from linear to circular together with stakeholders,” he said. “Not all the talent lives in the Berlaymont,” the Commission’s headquarters building.

Industry gets with the plan

In the past five years, leading European companies have started to embrace the EU’s circular ambitions. “In many countries industry leaders have understood that if they want to increase productivity, they have to change the business model,” Katainen said.

Peter Lacy, global managing director for growth and strategy at Accenture, concurs. In his 2015 book ‘Waste to Wealth’, he identified five distinct business models based on circularity: product as service, recovery and recycling, product life extension, sharing economy and circular supply, and a potential $4.5 trillion opportunity if these are deployed at scale by 2030. Initially, his research identified 120 companies using such models; today, that number has risen to 1,200.

For him, industry has the potential to transform the landscape. “Around 2,000 companies set the tone and framework for most of today’s global value chains”, he argues. As more companies adopt these models, however, “We will need to see more knowledge sharing and more diffusion and more incentives built into those value chains that allow us to move from linear to circular,” Lacy said.

The money is there

The EU is already making financing available for the shift towards the circular economy. The European Investment Bank (EIB) is planning to make the most of its future investments in businesses and projects which rely on circularity.

As a result, the EIB is now embedding the circular economy across all its lending priorities, according to Shiva Dustdar, head of the bank’s division for innovation finance advisory. “The instinctive reaction of our technical engineers, risk managers and bankers is, ‘is there opportunity for circularity here?’” Dustdar said.

Significantly, the EIB and EU’s top five banks have jointly committed €10 billion over the next five years to financing circular economy. To make these tools more effective, the new Commission could pass legislation to create a taxonomy for sustainable financing; banks have already asked the EU to come up with a clear rulebook on what kind of economic activities are sustainable.

“There are plenty of labels but consumers and investors are confused,” Katainen said. Apart from having a significant impact on sustainability, the new legislation would help Europe set the tone for green investments globally. “It’s a low hanging fruit that would have tremendous impact,” he added.

A perennial question is the role that consumers will play in enabling the transition to circular economy, and their willingness to exchange convenience for efficiency. Cars represent a perfect example: the average individual will use their vehicle for about 8 to 10 per cent of its life cycle, which has left many experts arguing that the energy and materials used to build one is immensely disproportionate to our need to move from one place to the other.

Katainen believes that when it comes to green purchasing decisions, “consumers are kings” and have already started “demanding much more from companies but also from their local authorities”. But Lacy takes a different view: “If you expect consumers to make trade-offs on those things, you will be sorely disappointed”. Instead, the priority should be on new approaches that “eradicate materials and provide consumers with the same value as an outcome.”

For Aart de Geus, chair of the executive board at Bertelsmann Foundation and chair of the supervisory board at Triodos Bank, businesses and policy makers will nonetheless have to adapt to the increasing demands from Europe’s youngest and brightest for environmental action. “The young generation will not be more responsible in terms of consumption but they will be more selective in where they will live and work,” said de Geus. He predicts companies that are not focusing on the circular economy will not be able to recruit the best and brightest people.

In addition, people’s minds need to be ingrained with a duty to cut waste. On average, every German produces non-recyclable waste five times heavier than their own weight each year.

Policy makers and businesses should include citizens in solving these problems, de Geus said, otherwise plans to adapt lifestyles to the demands of the circular economy will fail. “Make it clear to citizens what is the circular economy and why is it important. Ultimately, consumers have to wake up,” he said.",United States,2019.09
239,"Circular visions, small flakes and big data – TOMRA at K 2019","TOMRA Sorting Recycling will be at the K 2019 presenting its frontrunning position in the circular economy, including sorting equipment such as the recently introduced INNOSORT FLAKE, and a groundbreaking innovation in AI.

Resources exploitation has been reckless in satisfying demand for virgin products. Plastics are particularly the focus with its usage being questioned. At present, around 40 per cent of plastic packaging is sent to landfill, and 32 per cent ends up in the environment as litter. Reconsidering the way resources are obtained, used and reused is a major cornerstone for overcoming the barrier of limited resource availability.

As a leader of the ‘resource revolution’, TOMRA proposes stepping back from linear models and aligning with the reuse models of a truly circular economy that targets the recovery of materials back into the supply chain for new products. Once consumed, products are not littered but collected and sorted and kept in the loop, maintaining virgin-like quality and extracting a maximum of the product’s value. Thus, waste is turned into value.

With the circular economy being a topic of considerable debate, systematic approaches are being discussed to stimulate the change. Additional solutions are seen in the promotion of plastics collection, in stopping leakage through infrastructure and deposit systems, as well as in manufacturing products that are regenerative and restorative by design.

In effect, these would be ideal solutions and processes that can only be realised with all stakeholders participating.

TOMRA, being a key stakeholder and driver of this transformation, promotes the circular economy by means of advanced collection and sorting systems.

Volker Rehrmann, Executive Vice-President TOMRA Recycling and Mining and Head of TOMRA Circular Economy, said: “Continuing using our resources in an unsustainable and inefficient way should no longer be an option. At TOMRA, we take this global problem seriously and continuously develop new sorting solutions. At this year’s K-Show we will give an understanding of the circular economy and the role TOMRA and its products play in there.”

Displayed at K-Show, the INNOSORT FLAKE is a good example of positively impacting and purifying the recycling process. Since its launch at PRS Europe in Amsterdam in April 2019, it has shown to be the ideal dual-sorting solution for plastic recovery. Vast proportions of contaminants can be removed and the potential loss of PET flake material significantly reduced.

This all-in-one solution with ultra-high resolution and specialised sensor configuration offers superior performance with exponential results. It’s an economically favourable sorting solution providing a quick return on investment and scalable flexibility.

TOMRA also focuses on developing innovations to further advance the sorting process. Based on the collection and management of data and AI, TOMRA continues with the development of a deep learning software for sensor-based sorting.

As a subset of machine learning and AI, the deep learning software is in a position to learn from a sizeable amount of data, equalling or outperforming sorting results achieved by humans and conventional machines. With the combination of deep learning models and TOMRA’s sorting solutions, objects that could previously not be separated can now be sorted with high purity levels.

Continuous innovation and technological advancements for meeting today’s demands in the recovery and recycling process is essential for TOMRA.

242,French parliament to mull law to cut consumer waste,"France's parliament will from Tuesday debate legislation seeking to move the country closer to its ambition of a low-waste future, forcing electronics firms to use second-hand materials and cutting down on plastic refuse.

France, with its population of nearly 70 million, is a voracious consumer of natural resources, producing five tonnes of waste per person per year, according to the environment ministry.

The French Senate will begin three days of discussion on the bill before it is handed to the lower house of parliament, the National Assembly, where President Emmanuel Macron's government has a large majority.

The legislation would compel computer and cellphone repair shops to use second-hand materials, and oblige industries -- including manufacturers of toys, building materials, cigarettes and cleaning products -- to manage the waste these products generate as well as their packaging.

- 'Long way to go' -

The law would also compel manufacturers to provide consumers, beginning in 2021, with information on how their newly-purchased product can be repaired.

In a report last year titled ""Roadmap for the Circular Economy"", the French government outlined plans to halve the amount of non-hazardous waste sent to landfills by 2025.

""The situation is clear: France has a long way to go... In 2014, the rate of recovery of household and similar waste was 39 percent -- much lower than our German (65 percent) or Belgian (50 percent) neighbours,"" the report said.

""The rest, half of which is organic waste, is therefore incinerated or landfilled, which leads to local environmental pollution and energy waste that is incompatible with our climate objectives"" of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from burning oil and coal.

Only about a fifth of plastic was recycled, said the report -- lower than the European Union average of 30 percent or Scandinavian countries with more than 90 percent.

The French use about 47,000 tonnes of discardable cleaning wipes every year, and destroy some 650 million euros ($714 million) worth of unsold, non-food products.

The government has pitched the bill as crucial to the drive to create a so-called ""circular economy"" in which used products are fixed, reused, or recycled.

But not all are convinced.

""Sure, there are positive measures... but nothing to address the upstream, to avoid the generation of waste nor the overuse of packaging,"" said centrist senator Herve Maurey.

The research foundation Tara Ocean, in an open letter signed by numerous scientists, said the only way to turn the tide on plastic was to introduce a bottle return scheme.

Green parties surged across Europe in European elections in June, not least in France where the EELV party came third with 13.5 percent of the vote.

In January, France's junior environment minister Brune Poirson promised a law to tackle waste after a television documentary showed Amazon destroying millions of products that had been returned by consumers.

British fashion firm Burberry also caused a furore last year by acknowledging it had burned unsold clothes, accessories and perfume worth £28.6 million (23 million euros or $35.5 million) annually to prevent them being sold off cheaply.

Macron has sought to portray himself as a friend of the Green movement, especially in the fight against climate change.

But his image was tarnished when prominent campaigner Nicolas Hulot, who Macron named as environment minister, spectacularly quit the government last August, saying his cabinet colleagues were doing too little to tackle climate change.

The world produces more than 300 million tonnes of plastics annually, and there are at least five trillion plastic pieces floating in our oceans, scientists say.

Some 40 million tonnes of electronic waste is produced every year.",United States,2019.09
245,Glamour and Sustainability: Inside The Green Carpet Fashion Awards That Closed Milan’s Fashion Week,"Milan’s Fashion Week closed on Sunday with a soirée held at the sumptuous La Scala theater, celebrating the industry’s engagement with sustainability, climate change, and social responsibility. For the third time, the Green Carpet Fashion Awards (GCFA) were granted to members of the fashion community effectively committed to embracing real changes in the system’s production chain—reducing waste, finding alternatives to plastic, protecting small sustainable businesses, and innovating and researching cleaner, less planet-harmful technologies. Italians definitely know how to glamorize sustainability: The evening was elegantly choreographed in a festive atmosphere. The fashion community turned out in force, along with a dashing contingent of celebrities, walking a sustainable floral green carpet made from recycled plastic sneaking through delicate canopies of vine leaves, envisioned by Vogue’s Hamish Bowles, the awards’ creative director, and paying homage to Leonardo da Vinci, whose 500th anniversary of death occurs this year.

The awards were established in 2017 by the National Chamber of Italian Fashion (Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana), masterminded by its chairman, Carlo Capasa, in collaboration with Eco-Age’s creative director Livia Firth, with the Ministry of Economic Development, the Italian Trade Agency, and the Municipality of Milan.

This season, the event was hosted by Jon Kortajarena and Adut Akech, resplendent in a billowy Valentino dress in pale blue silk faille. They introduced the 12 awards lavished on entrepreneurs, small businesses, craftsmen, and designers championing ethical and sustainable practices. Among the highlights of the evening, filmmaker Ginevra Elkann awarded François-Henri Pinault the GCFA Visionary Award. Kering’s chief executive was the force behind the Fashion Pact, prompted by France’s President Emmanuel Macron and recently presented at the G7 summit, representing 32 fashion companies and approximately 150 brands—all committed to working on a more sustainable approach. From the stage, Pinault urged companies to embrace corporate responsibility, getting together to share experiences and knowledge. “We need to act together, to take concrete action,” he said. “Let’s join the Fashion Pact, to make fashion clean and great again.”

Prada’s Lorenzo Bertelli presented the Circular Economy Award to the volunteer divers of Healthy Seas, a nongovernmental organization, and businesses for cleaning the Mediterranean, the Adriatic Sea, and North Sea from derelict plastic fishing nets and waste littering the waters, a deadly threat to marine life. More than a 100 divers and several fishing communities work in the NGO, which transforms discarded nylon in ECONYL, a regenerated nylon yarn used by fashion and interior industries. Prada recently launched a project called Prada Re-Nylon, a line of bags and backpacks made from repurposed ECONYL yarn.

On a cheerful note, the gondoliers of Venice were granted the Ecostewardship Award, for the use of natural merino wool, provided by The Woolmark Company, for their famous striped sweaters; Lou Doillon awarded the GCFA for Responsible Disruption to I Was a Sari, a small, zero-dividends company based in Mumbai which repurposes vintage saris into new outfits, investing the profits back into developing the label and advancing the conditions of the female community of seamstresses and embroiderers. Clad in a beautiful golden-embellished creation in black chiffon, the French actress handed the Chopard-designed statuette (made of Fairmined-certified ethical gold, of course) to CEO Stefano Funari, who was surrounded onstage by the Indian artisans, exquisitely dressed in their stunning pre-loved and upcycled saris.

No designer has tackled the sustainability conversation as forcefully and with as much integrity and conviction (and creative fashion verve) as Stella McCartney, the true pioneer of unwavering commitment to ethical fashion practices. She received the much deserved Groundbreaker Award and was joined onstage by her whole cheerful team. In her emotional and engaging speech, she went through those personal reasons which made her embrace a responsible lifestyle. “I was brought up a vegetarian in the countryside by two socially conscious parents,” she said. She too urged the fashion community to share knowledge and experiences: “Sustainability is today a global open workshop, an ongoing process propelled forward by trials and errors. The definitive solutions have yet to come—that’s why the conversation has to be circular, with as many players as possible taking part in the debate.”

It would be too long to mention all the awards and the recognitions granted, but one thing was clear: The industry is definitely taking action. It’s a promising start, with big Italian companies like MaxMara and Zegna joining the discussion with a pragmatic, effective approach, and with young designers like Flavia La Rocca (recipient of the GCFA Franca Sozzani Award for Best Emerging Designer) becoming more and more committed to an ethical fashion mind-set.

But back to the star wattage that an award ceremony requires, sustainable as it may be—it was provided in spades by the fabulous appearance of the divine Sophia Loren, still sublime at 85, her charisma and consummate stage presence still intact. With an emotional and witty speech, she brought down the house while presenting the GCFA Legacy Award to the equally fabulous Valentino Garavani. Tan and dapper as always, the 87-year-old legendary designer seemed utterly pleased by the accolade, which he graciously received. He was also granted a well-deserved, thunderous standing ovation.",United States,2019.09

247,PhD position: Strategies of circular Economy and Advanced bio-based solutions to keep our Lands and seas alIVE from plastics contamination,"We are looking for a highly motivated PhD to join our research group CVP at Clermont-Ferrand (https://iccf.uca.fr/recherche/photochimie/cycle-de-vie-des-polymeres/).

A number of projects that are ongoing in our group deal with environmental impact of polymer materials. The PhD position will involve in SEALIVE H2020 European project. The general objective of SEALIVE project is to develop innovative business models for advanced bio-based plastics directly supporting the Plastics Strategy set by the EC. The project aims at standing as a reference to be disseminated and widely used in Europe and beyond.

To achieve this goal SEALIVE will implement sustainable solutions based on novel bio-based plastics to avoid plastics ending-up on land and sea. Along the SEALIVE project we will join the ambition of biopolymer producers with cutting-edge processing technologies, to follow the best end of life channels, targeting to build up a strong reference framework for the policy makers and harmonisation. Concretely, through the development of:

- New bio-based plastics solutions (PLA, PHA, starch and novel blends) with advanced properties (mechanical, thermal, controlled lifetime durability, improved biodegradability) and resulting from the conversion of photosynthetic aquatic biomass, organic waste and new chemistry routes.

- Recycling-by-design techniques and cutting-edge compounding and extrusion technologies which will reach market products requirements (technical and cost)

- Effective end of life solutions (NIR sorting, polymer markers, valorisation of compostability and marine degradation) targeting circular economy.

New bioplastics solutions will be upscaled and demonstrated by 8 end-applications (use cases) with high potential for pollution reduction on soils and water media and in different territories.

Finally, to guarantee the adoption of the innovations and strategies defined within SEALIVE all these developments will be supported with policy, pre-normative, and training actions in several European countries.

The work of PhD scholar will involve mainly on the extraction of bio-based additives for bio-based polymers to control the lifetime durability, and to investigate the interrelation photo-bio degradation of the new elaborated bio-based polymer materials.

248,3 ways companies can start embracing the circular economy,"Even though the primary focus of climate action so far has been shifting to renewable energy, tackling climate change will also require completely rethinking how we make and use products. A new report from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation , an organization focused on the circular economy, found that if the world shifted to renewables, that would only account for 55% of our current emissions. The remaining 45% of emissions mostly come from making and using food, clothes, cars, buildings, and other products. To meet the climate goal of zero emissions by 2050, all of those things also need to change.

“We’ve been focused almost exclusively on renewable energy and efficiency, which are obviously essential, but it’s clear that we can’t meet the objectives unless we actually tackle production and consumption as part of the equation,” says Andrew Morlet, chief executive of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. The report looked at what would happen if five key industries adopted a circular approach, meaning that instead of the current system—digging up materials, using a lot of energy to make something, and then a consumer eventually sending the end product to a landfill—materials could be used in a closed loop. If the steel, plastic, aluminum, cement, and food industries adopted this approach, the report calculated that it would reduce 9.3 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2050, as much as eliminating all of the current emissions from transportation.

Other industries, from fashion to tech, will also need to adopt the same approach. The report outlines three key principles for a circular economy.

Products need to be designed differently so that they can be used longer, resold, repaired, upgraded, and upcycled into new products, says Morlet. That means, for example, choosing materials that can easily be recycled and designing the whole product so that it can be taken apart. “The fact that you can design to repair or remanufacture products significantly increases the value of those products over time and also captures the energy and the inputs that go into creating that product and putting them into people’s hands,” he says. “If we can keep that energy used longer by having the products used longer, that lowers the energy demand of the system and helps in delivering the climate targets very dramatically.”

For a food company, it might mean using food waste as an ingredient in a new product. Companies also need to choose low-carbon materials. Design choices can also eliminate waste in the broader system—whether that means offering a car-sharing service to address the fact that cars spend the majority of the time parked, or finding new ways to reduce the huge amount of food that’s grown but never eaten.

Keep products and materials in use

With the right designs, companies can create new systems and services to reuse materials and not waste the energy used to create them. That might mean new ways of packaging products, such as Loop, a system that major brands are testing to bring reusable packaging to everyday products like shampoo and ice cream. For Ikea, it means moving to new models such as furniture rental so products like bookcases and tables don’t end up thrown out at the curb. If a piece of clothing is worn twice as long, it could potentially avoid 44% of the product’s emissions. When a product reaches the end of its life, the next step is to capture the materials inside. For plastic, for example, recycling 1 metric ton could reduce emissions by as much as 3 tons compared to making the same amount of material from virgin fossil fuels.

Industrial agriculture isn’t sustainable, from the pollution caused by fertilizer use to the fact that antibiotics used in farm animals are leading to antibiotic-resistant bacteria that can harm human health. Another part of the circular economy involves rethinking agriculture in a way that regenerates natural resources. Regenerative agriculture—a set of farming practices that have the potential not only to make soil healthier but also to capture more carbon in that soil—is one important part of the approach. A circular approach also means capturing nutrients from food waste that is currently sent to landfills and bringing those nutrients back to farms. “Essentially, the circular economy of food starts to reconnect the flow of nutrients to make much better use of food as it actually moves through the system,” Morlet says.",United States,2019.09
249,Asia Pacific Circular Economy Roundtable: Discovering New Opportunities for Industrial Transformation,"KAOHSIUNG, TAIWAN, Sept. 23, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Taiwan Circular Economy Network will host the ""2019 Asia Pacific Circular Economy Roundtable - New Frontier"", part of the Taiwan Circular Economy Week series, from October 16 to 18 at Kaohsiung Exhibition Center. The forum will provide a platform for participants to share global industry trends in circular economy and present actual implementation results of Taiwanese enterprises. On September 19, the Network hosted a press conference to promote and introduce the forum. The event was held in collaboration with the "" Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) "" and ""Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)"", and co-organizers Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), Taiwan Sugar Corporation (TSC), Taiwan Power Company (Taipower), Chinese Petroleum Corporation (CPC), and China Steel Corporation (CSC).

Speakers at this very first Asia Pacific Circular Economy Roundtable include Janez Potocnik, Co-chair of the UNEP International Resource Panel; 14 international experts from various international companies, including global material manufacturer DSM; and also representatives from 49 Taiwanese enterprises, such as Hair O'right International Corp., Far Eastern New Century Corporation, and Taiwan Sugar Corporation. The speakers will share their observations on global market trends, actual enterprise application experiences, and specific transformation tools. In addition to presenting the current progress of circular economy in Taiwan, the venue is designed according to circular economy principles and concepts, and offers five exhibition routes with different themes to demonstrate a comprehensive circular economy experience.

""MOEA Deputy Minister"" Tseng Wen-sheng mentioned that circular economy is one of the major 5+2 industry innovation policies launched by Taiwan authorities. It is an important industrial transformation strategy for Taiwanese industries, and a necessary shift for companies working with international supply chains. The ""MOEA"", which is responsible for launching such policies, rolled out the ""Circular Economy Promotion Plan"" last year. By examining Taiwan's overall material flow and usage from a circular economy perspective, the Plan aims to improve recycling efficiency and percentage of different recycled materials, and reduce the amount of waste that goes into incinerators or landfills.

Starting with CPC, CSC, Taipower, and TSC, ""the Ministry"" will gradually apply circular economy policies onto the companies' major material recycling procedures. The eventual goal is to achieve industrial symbiosis, resource productivity, and co-exist in harmony with the environment. Recycling can extend the life cycle of resources or even endlessly reuse them. It can greatly reduce waste and pollution problems and successfully introduce circular economy concepts into every industry. Thus ""the Ministry"" invited ""state-owned"" enterprises, ITRI, Taiwan Circular Economy Network, and other companies to assemble at the Asia Pacific Circular Economy Roundtable to collectively discover new opportunities for Taiwanese industries and set up a platform to connect with global economic trends.

""To promote circular economy, ""EPA"" devised a Resource Recycling and Recovery Plan (2018-2020), which focuses on the perspectives of material production, consumption, waste management, and regrind market through integrating cross-departmental promotion strategies and measures, and uses performance indicators such as resource productivity and cyclical use rate for evaluation,"" said ""EPA"" Director Ying-ying Lai. ""In addition, with the establishment of individual task forces for multiple kinds of resources by Taiwan authorities and the green deals between industries, we are gradually achieving the goals of maximum resource recycling and minimum waste treatment."" Lai further stressed that Taiwan Circular Economy Week is the first event organized by Taiwan authorities forces in a cross-departmental collaboration to demonstrate the results of circular economy implementation. The event starts off with the Taiwan Circular Economy Summit in Taipei, which features circular economy research and policy. It will be followed by the ""Asia Pacific Circular Economy Roundtable"" and the inauguration of the ""Taiwan Circular Economy (TCE) 100"" in Kaohsiung. Organized by the joint collaboration of ""MOEA"" and ""EPA"", these events not only feature the Taiwan authorities' administrative efforts but also recognize the contributions from private enterprises. ""Through discussions and personnel interactions at Taiwan Circular Economy Week, we hope to promote a circular economy and drive Taiwan to becoming a circular economy hotspot in Asia,"" added Lai.

Taiwan Circular Economy Network Chairman Charles Huang expressed that in circular economy, ""we must look forward for next 20 years and let the children born today have a better future, which means circular economy is also our responsibility to next generations. The key is to put resources in the right place and create value, and this would require systematic collaborations between industries and fields to realize. Luckily, Taiwan has a complete industry chain, which is an advantage in linking resources. Furthermore, SMEs in Taiwan are flexible and have a bigger advantage when entering this new market, since larger enterprises, which were successful in the past linear economy, would need to undergo a major overhaul to keep up with the new trends. A circular economy environment also offers a lot of opportunities for new startups as the new model follows a completely different production and usage logic than past economic models, presenting a brand new slate for innovative business models."" ITRI Executive Vice President Alex Y.M. Peng expressed that sustainability has become a common topic for governments and enterprises around the world. Companies are shifting towards manufacturing recyclable products, for instance, a lot of major international enterprises announced they will be using recycled materials. Taiwan already has strong manufacturing capabilities and is part of the worldwide industry chain. By implementing circular economy concepts and technologies in local industries as soon as possible, Taiwan could become one of the leading players in the coming green circular economy ecosystem and supply chain. ITRI continues to innovate available technology and brainstorm solutions with major enterprises in Taiwan. Some existing examples include TSC's clam shell recycling technology, Taipower's CO2 capture technology implementation, and CSC's basic-oxygen-furnace slag high-value transformation technology. High-level recycling technologies can boost the role of Taiwanese industries in the global recycling technology field, generating an advantage for local companies to seize the latest business opportunities. Green chemistry solutions provider Everlight Chemical Industrial Corp. also shared the company's experiences in implementing circular economy practices. Chairman James Chen remarked that it is indeed a challenge to incorporate circular economy concepts into the existing manufacturing model. Besides figuring out how to integrate related technology and ideas, the company also has to consider market demands. Nevertheless, Everlight Chemical creatively found a way to reduce ammonia and nitrogen levels in wastewater, and also overhauled existing equipment to reduce manufacturing time and the amount of raw material used. The company insists on using green chemistry manufacturing technologies for clean productions, a change which can effectively bring down energy use and raw material consumption, and consequently cut down possible pollution. Everlight Chemical has acquired ISO 14001 certification and has been awarded the Excellence in Corporate Social Responsibility Award for seven consecutive years. Their 2020 vision is to become a happy globalized enterprise which continuously innovates and provides green chemistry solutions. The Asia Pacific Circular Economy Roundtable will be held between October 16 and 18 at Kaohsiung Exhibition Center. The event is directed by the ""MOEA"" and ""EPA"", organized by Taiwan Circular Economy Network and co-organized by ITRI and the four major ""state-owned"" businesses. Speakers include a high-level UN expert, and 14 international speakers from the UK, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, the Philippines, Singapore, China, and Japan; and local speakers from 49 Taiwanese companies which had implemented circular economy practices. Five circular economy exhibition routes with five respective themes (Agro Cycle, Textile Cycle, Metal Cycle and Cross-sector Cooperation, Plastic, Energy Efficiency and Industrial Symbiosis) will also be unveiled to offer the 400 attendees from home and abroad an experience to further understand circular economy. Participants are encouraged to discuss and exchange ideas on the new opportunities brought about by circular economy and together seek a suitable circular economy development direction for the Asia-Pacific region.",United States,2019.09
250,GM and MIT Solve Announce Circular Economy Challenge Winners,"Timed to coincide with the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week, vehicle manufacturer General Motors (GM) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have announced the winners of the Circular Economy Challenge.

The Circular Economy Challenge seeks solutions that enable increased and equitable production of renewable and recyclable raw materials for products and packaging, design and production of mass-market clothing and apparel that are recycled and recyclable or biodegradable at end of life, new business models that encourage extending the lifetime of products rather than frequent purchases and recycling of complex products like electronics.

“The Circular Economy Challenge seeks tech-based solutions that help people create and consume goods that are renewable, repairable, reusable and recyclable,” says Sharon Bort, sustainability community officer for MIT Solve based in Cambridge, Mass.

Solve is an initiative of MIT that advances lasting solutions from tech entrepreneurs to address the world's most pressing problems. Each year, MIT Solve launches four Global Challenges across its pillars: Economic Prosperity, Health, Learning and Sustainability. In 2019, Solve’s Sustainability pillar launched the Circular Economy Challenge.

GM entered its second-year partnership with Solve through a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) Education grant.

“The MIT Solve platform provides General Motors the opportunity to collaborate with and support innovative thinkers and entrepreneurs from all over the world,” says Ken Kelzer, GM vice president of global vehicle components and subsystems in Detroit. “As our industry continues its evolution and revolution, General Motors’ success will be entirely dependent on a skilled workforce that can help us drive mobility solutions of the future.”

Winners of the Circular Economy Challenge announced this week include:
• AIR-INK: AIR-INK captures and sequesters carbon found in air pollution to produce industrial-grade inks and pigments for high-grade printing materials.
• Algramo: Algramo is scaling reusable packaging on a global level by providing packaging that communicates with its Internet of Things-connected vending machines to dispense fast-moving consumer goods into reusable packaging.
• BioCellection: BioCellection breaks down low-grade, unrecyclable polyethylene plastics into chemical intermediates and then uses these intermediates to make performance materials for cars and construction that are more sustainable than traditional industrial materials.
• Mylea: Mylea is a substitute for traditional animal leather made from fungal mycelium that’s grown in fibrous agricultural waste like sawdust or sugarcane, replacing animal- and petroleum-based leather with a high-quality alternative without harming any animals.
• Queen of Raw: Queen of Raw is a marketplace for businesses to buy and sell unused textiles, keeping them out of landfills and turning pollution into profit.
• The Renewal Workshop: The Renewal Workshop operates a zero waste circular system for apparel and textile brands that recovers the full value of products already created.
• Rheaply: Rheaply provides software for commercial clients that integrates resource sharing, asset management and sustainability metrics on a user-friendly platform, thereby unlocking assets that are hidden in storage, underutilized or bound for landfills.
• Xilinat: Xilinat uses a patented process to transform agricultural waste into a high-quality sugar substitute that looks and tastes identical to sugar, yet is ideal for diabetics, low in calories and protects teeth against cavities.

The Circular Economy Challenge kicked off in May with $100,000 total in grant funding awarded to the top innovative solutions. Other prize sponsors include Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, Vodafone Americas Foundation, Schmidt Futures, Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund, the Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Court and the Andan Foundation.

Solve received more than 300 solutions for the Circular Economy Challenge. Finalists have been invited to pitch their solutions this week at Solve Challenge Finals, Solve’s annual pitch event during U.N. General Assembly Week in New York City. Solve will deploy its global community of private, public and nonprofit leaders to form partnerships these Solver teams need to scale their impact.

For the two prizes GM sponsored, the company sought solutions that foster prosperity and social mobility for underrepresented community members and solutions that help communities shift toward a more circular economy through zero waste and zero carbon, according to Kelzer.

“The goal of the challenge is to help advance solutions that will help our world shift toward circular supply chains where materials which may not have a clear reuse are given a second life. It provides tech entrepreneurs with funding to unlock and implement their solutions,” he says. “There are innovations happening around us that are lacking access to capital and expertise they need to reach its full potential and be scaled—the Circular Economy Challenge is a platform to help make these innovations a reality.”

Any individual or group with a relevant, tech-based solution was able to apply for the Circular Economy Challenge.

“Solve looks for a diverse portfolio of solutions across geography, development stage and team member background,” says Bort. “At Solve, we believe that talent and ingenuity exist everywhere. Through our open innovation platform, we aim to source promising, early-stage solutions that may lack access to critical resources needed to scale. By identifying these entrepreneurs, understanding their needs and connecting them to resources, Solve’s goal is to help scale their work globally. Waste is a growing, global issue. To change course, we’ll need creative ideas, new technologies and innovative ways to reduce, reuse, recycle.”",United States,2019.09

252,Alliance to End Plastic Waste Joins Project STOP to Help Tackle Plastic Waste in the Environment in Indonesia,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 23, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- The Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW) today announced a partnership with Project STOP to further scale up the development of more sustainable and circular waste management systems in Indonesia. Through Project STOP, the Alliance aims to dramatically improve waste collection, bring collection services for the first time to households, create permanent local jobs in the waste management industry, and clean up areas littered with plastic pollution.

The Alliance's three-year collaboration with Project STOP will focus on the regency of Jembrana, located on the northwest coast of Bali. The Alliance will support a feasibility study to achieve a future free of unmanaged plastic waste throughout the island and to assess how to extend the approach, as well as provide financial support and technical expertise.

A recent study shows the island leaks 33,000 tons of plastic into the ocean every year. A major challenge is the lack of appropriate waste management services to keep households and businesses from open burning or dumping waste into the environment. Stopping the leakage of plastics into the marine environment is critical to sustaining the island's tourism industry, on which many lives and livelihoods depend. Jembrana is estimated to leak 13,200 tonnes of plastic into the environment each year, due to its population size and lack of waste and recycling infrastructure.

Launched in 2017, Project STOP is an initiative co-founded by Borealis and SYSTEMIQ that designs, implements, and scales circular economy solutions to prevent plastic pollution in Southeast Asia. Working with companies, local governments and community groups, Project STOP supports cities with technical expertise to achieve zero leakage of waste, improve circular economy systems create new jobs in waste management, and reduce the harmful impact of mismanaged waste on public health, tourism and fisheries. Project STOP's long-term ambition is to establish new solutions and models that can be rapidly scaled-up across the whole plastics chain, from the uses of plastic through to waste collection and recycling.

""The Alliance is focusing on areas where the need to improve the management of plastic waste is urgent and where our member companies across the plastic value chain can offer technical and business expertise. Project STOP therefore fits perfectly into the Alliance's strategy that focuses on the four pillars infrastructure, innovation, education and clean up. In Jembrana, we have an opportunity to work with the local community to build new waste and recycling infrastructure to prevent plastic from leaking into the environment,"" said David Taylor, Chairman of the Board, President and CEO of Procter & Gamble, and Chairman of the AEPW.

The Alliance-funded city partnership in Jembrana is Project STOP's first city partnership on the island of Bali. The project is designed to be economically self-sufficient within three years, so the system can be operated by the local municipality and community, both of which will be closely consulted and involved throughout the project.

""We are proud to welcome the Alliance to End Plastics Waste as a strategic partner of Project STOP as we share a strong commitment to addressing this major global challenge; stopping the leakage of plastics into the environment,"" says Alfred Stern, CEO of Borealis, the co-founder of Project STOP.

• Cleaning up beaches and rivers in consultation with the local government.

Launched in 2017, Project STOP is a joint initiative of Borealis and SYSTEMIQ, which was later joined by Nestle, Nova Chemicals, Borouge and Veolia.

The program works with city governments to eliminate leakage of plastics into the ocean, increase plastics recycling and support the wider system changes required for a plastics circular economy.

According to Borealis, a recent study has shown that the Island of Bali leaks 33,000 metric tons of plastic — 13,200 metric tons from Jembrana alone — into the ocean every year, due in part to the lack of appropriate waste management services.

“The Alliance is focusing on areas where the need to improve the management of plastic waste is urgent and where our member companies across the plastic value chain can offer technical and business expertise,” said David Taylor, chairman of the board, president and CEO of Procter & Gamble, and chairman of the AEPW.

Project STOP, he went on to say, “fits perfectly” into the Alliance’s strategy that focuses on the four pillars of infrastructure, innovation, education and clean up.

“In Jembrana, we have an opportunity to work with the local community to build new waste and recycling infrastructure to prevent plastic from leaking into the environment,” Taylor continued.

The Alliance-funded city partnership in Jembrana is Project STOP’s first city partnership on the island of Bali.

Borealis is currently carrying out another STOP city partnership in the East Java major fishing port of Muncar to address the issue of marine litter there.

“We are proud to welcome the Alliance to End Plastics Waste as a strategic partner of Project STOP as we share a strong commitment to addressing this major global challenge: stopping the leakage of plastics into the environment,” said Alfred Stern, CEO of Borealis, the co-founder of Project STOP.

The AEPW was formed early this year in the face of mounting pressure regarding plastic pollution in the environment, particularly in the oceans.

About 40 companies have come together to join the alliance and provide funding to create programs to tackle the problem. There was an initial pledge of $1 billion with a goal of raising $1.5 billion.

The alliance initially has focused on a few areas to begin its efforts, including the collection of plastic waste along rivers that lead to oceans, municipal and city partnerships, idea incubation and information technology infrastructure, the group said.",United States,2019.09

256,World’s 1.8 billion youth must ‘have a say in the future of the planet’,"This article is brought to you in association with the United Nations.

It is “crucial” that the world’s 1.8 billion young people have a say in the fight against climate change and ultimately “the future of the planet” according to the UN Youth Envoy Jayathma Wickramanayake.

Young activists, innovators, entrepreneurs and change-makers are due to gather at UN headquarters in New York at the Youth Climate Summit on Saturday 21 September to put pressure on global leaders to take action to prevent climate change.

Ms. Wickramanayake will be there, and UN News asked her why young people are so important to the climate action debate.

Why is it necessary to bring young people together to discuss climate change?

There are 1.8 billion young people in the world today, that’s the largest number ever, so it is crucial that they have a say in the future of the planet, in their future. The school strike for climate action started by the young Swedish activist, Greta Thunberg, in her home town, Stockholm, and the other strikes by young people around the world which followed, have shown that they are demanding action on climate and want to have a decisive role in the decision-making process. The time to respond with action is now.

This Youth Climate Summit taking place at UN Headquarters will bring together the key leaders of the youth climate movement and provide a chance for them to engage with a wider global audience. Some 1000 young people from across the world will be attending the event in person and many more will be following online.

Is this an acknowledgement that those people in power, in other word adults, are not doing enough?

It is clear that tackling climate change needs to involve all people, young and old, privileged and underprivileged, from developed and developing countries. Young people want and deserve a role in what should be a participatory process and the school strikes for climate action were born out of their desire to make global leaders aware of and act on their concerns. Just as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development underlines that young people are the torchbearers of sustainable development, they are also the thinkers, doers and innovators who can realise this agenda. They have a stake in the future as this is the planet, they will inherit; it is they who will bear the impact of a changing climate.

What do you think this youth summit can achieve?

The Summit is a platform for young leaders and youth-led organizations to showcase the actions they are taking to slow down climate change with the aim of keeping to a 1.5 degree Celsius increase in global temperatures above pre-industrial levels. In May, I launched the “Summer of Solutions” challenge to young people to create innovative technology-based climate solutions. These include developing a platform to enhance the access of localized climate and market information, developing tech tools to boost the “circular economy,” an economic system aimed at eliminating waste and the re-use of resources. The best ideas will be highlighted at the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit on 23 September.

The youth Summit will also feature a strong intergenerational component that will carry forward into the Climate Action Summit and which will allow youth activists from both the global south and north to question world political leaders about addressing climate change.

Providing young climate pioneers with an opportunity to engage with political leaders, including by asking bold and provocative questions, as well as proposing concrete solutions in a UN setting will be an important testament to fact that the voices of youth are being listened to. Beyond that, and more importantly, they are being responded to and they are influencing decision making at the highest levels. The youth summit is the United Nations Youth Strategy “Youth 2030” in action, where the first priority is engagement, participation and advocacy to amplify young peoples’ voices for the promotion of a peaceful, just and sustainable world.

What practical steps will come out of the interaction between youth and global leaders?

The Youth Climate Summit will prioritize meaningful engagement with leaders from national governments, the private sector and civil society. It is hoped that a large number of countries around the world will commit to consulting youth when formulating and designing climate action policies, plans and laws.

It is also expected that by facilitating these exchanges, corporate leaders will commit to working with, mentoring, as well as learning from, young entrepreneurs and/or youth-led companies, many of whom are in fact at the forefront of developing solutions to climate change.

A key voice at the youth summit will, no doubt, be Greta Thunberg. How important is she?

Young people think, feel and do things differently to older people and this is incredibly valuable as we face what the UN Secretary-General has called the “existential crisis” of climate change.

Greta Thunberg is an incredibly inspirational model for young people the world over and a powerful symbol of their desire to take action to prevent climate change. It is no small feat to get the attention of world leaders in the way she has done, so in this sense she is creating a powerful climate action movement led by the world’s young people, which cannot be ignored. I am also very proud of the youth activists from the global south, who might not be getting as much media attention; such as Venessa from Uganda and Timothy from Fiji and thousands more who are vocal advocates for our common future and are Greta’s biggest allies around the world.",United States,2019.09
257,Young India wants bold statement from Modi | India News - Times of India,"This story is from September 23, 2019

NEW YORK: Twenty-four hours before the high-profile Climate Action Summit , the corridors of the United Nations ’ headquarters are swarming with impeccably dressed top diplomats, negotiators and distinguished climate activists. All that reaches your ears are intense deliberations on what to expect from the big day on Monday. 

Amid the high-profile attendees stands a 15-year-old from India. He might get easily missed in the crowd but his demands are unmissable. Std X student Aditya Mukarji wants Prime Minister Narendra Modi to “protect forests, wetlands and ban tree-felling in the name of development”. 

A full-time volunteer at the New Delhi-based Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group, Aditya was nominated by the NGO to participate in the summit based on his 18-month work done to eliminate 25 million plastic straws and other single-use plastics from the ecosystem. 

With Modi slated to deliver a speech on Monday, the country’s young voices presently in New York are loud and clear. 

“Apart from implementation of green protocol in government institutions and encouraging circular economy, the Prime Minister should rope in youth-led initiatives in the country. To date, we are suffering from lack of funds and technical expertise. Not just strikes, youth initiatives can be helpful at many actionable levels,” says Kerala’s young climate activist PR Vishnu, who is among 100 youngsters across the world to get the special ‘green ticket’ for participating in the first UN Youth Climate Summit held on Saturday. 

UN young leader for sustainable development goals , 25-year-old Kartik Sawhney of Haryana NGO I-Stem is hoping for PM’s commitment towards engaging the country’s youth in not just coming up with innovative solutions to achieve climate goals but also providing a platform for them to co-create the true impact. 

“I am looking forward to see how the youth can get further involved in consultations. Given the focus on climate change and universal health care this United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), I also hope to see an accelerated push to make progress on these targets, ensuring that we especially pay attention to the most under-represented communities that are impacted by this,” says Sawhney. 

As per the UN schedule, Modi is in the 8.10pm (IST) slot along with New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern, Marshall Islands President Dr Hilda C Heine and Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel. The four have been allotted 15 minutes together. They take the mike soon after UN secretary general António Guterres opens the Summit. The UN chief has asked leaders to come to New York with a definite plan and not “just beautiful speeches”. 

TOI had reported on September 17 that Modi is unlikely to make any dramatic announcement and will stick to India’s commitments made in the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. He is expected to inform the global leaders and world audience that India is taking many actions on the ground to ensure global average temperature rise is within 2 degrees Celsius. Modi will launch an international Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI). 

Maintaining that India has become an “over-consumptive and use-and-throw” society, Mukarji is expecting a bold statement from the PM. “Single-use plastic items should be banned all across the country, along with enforcing extended producer responsibility,” he adds. 

The young eyes would be on the PM on Monday. Would he live up to their expectations? New York will tell.",United States,2019.09

267,FW (forward) launched to end throw-away culture,"Efforts of the London Waste and Recycling Board (LWARB) and QSA Partners, who are working together on the Circular Fashion Fast Forward project, have led to the launch of a new outdoor clothing brand, FW (forward), by Full Stack Supply Co. The new range of clothes is meant to help put an end to throw-away consumerism, and ensuring the garments last and last.FW is one of a number of brands working with LWARB and QSA on the Circular Fashion Fast Forward project, funded by the C&A Foundation as a part of their Bridging the Gap initiative. FW recognises that incorporating circular economy practices is key to future-proofing their business. The company’s new range of clothes has been designed to help put an end to throw-away consumerism, emphasising durable, high-quality construction and materials to ensure the garments last and last.The real innovation however—a result of tailored business model development from LWARB and QSA—is that customers will be able to repair their clothing if needed. Through a dedicated service designed to make clothes last longer, customers will have the option of having garments repaired for free within a warranty period. Repairs will still be available to customers at a low cost beyond the warranty period.A repair service is one of several models companies may integrate into their business to create more value and profit, whilst reducing their environmental impact. Repairing products helps to keep them in use for longer and builds loyalty with the customer. By repairing every garment it can, FW is selling clothes that could be worn for life. This is an important move away from the usual practice of simply disposing of clothes when they become damaged.As people are waking up to the impacts of their shopping habits and increasingly demanding more sustainable options from the brands they love, a growing number of businesses are implementing alternatives to the current high-impact ‘take, make, dispose’ business model.Olivia Herbert, head of Operations at FW, said: “The business model advice from LWARB and QSA has been essential. It has helped us to understand the circular models that best fit with our rapidly-growing business and our high performance, forward-thinking apparel for alpine living. We know that we’re just starting out on our journey to take our place in the circular economy and we’re delighted to be global leaders on the expedition.”LWARB and QSA Partners are taking FW, Ted Baker, Farfetch and one other global brand on a journey to explore circular economy business models, as part of the C&A Foundation Bridging the Gap initiative. Each brand wants to match their ambition for greater sustainability with their customers’ needs and values. At the end of the project, each will have tested the best circular business model for both their business and their customers.Andrea Crump, project lead for Circular Fashion Fast Forward, said: “The aim of our project is to demonstrate how the circular economy can help brands to hit their environmental and economic targets and succeed in today’s marketplace. We are working with several market players across the fashion sector to illustrate the competitive advantage of circular business models. And how they can help to build not just a more sustainable business but customer loyalty too.” (SV)",United States,2019.09
269,India wants to be global steel hub,"New Delhi: The Modi government seems determined to boost the country’s crude steel production capacity to 300 MT by 2030-31 in a bid to make India a global steel manufacturing hub.

At present, China is the world’s largest steel producer with a production capacity of 928.3 MT of crude steel (2018), while India, with 106.5 MT of crude steel production, ranks second on the list. Dedicated participation of all stakeholders is a must to achieve the projected capacity target of 300 MT by 2030-31.

To deliberate on major issues plaguing the sector, the Ministry of Steel is organising in Delhi on Monday a day-long conclave, during which Steel Minister Dharmendra Pradhan will seek suggestions from the stakeholders to address its challenges, identify opportunities and arrive at tangible interventions that can aid the growth of the Indian steel industry.

The National Steel Policy 2017 envisages ‘creating a self-sufficient steel industry that is technologically advanced, globally competitive and promotes inclusive growth’.

Being the third largest steel consumer in the world after China and USA, India’s per capita steel consumption at 74 kgs is one-third the global average of 225 kgs.

Various countries have focused on rapidly increasing their steel consumption in the high growth phase of their economy. At present, India’s majority steel demand comes from construction, infrastructure, automobiles and capital goods, among others.

Steel intensive construction offers an increased pace of durable and environmentally sustainable construction. Its recyclable nature also contributes to the circular economy.

The government has set a target to make India a $5 trillion economy by 2024-25, therefore promoting domestic steel industry is essential, given its high GDP multiplier and critical role in the construction and infrastructure sectors, said the Ministry.",United States,2019.09
270,New Finnish tech for automated sorting of waste textiles,"Finnish recycling firm LSJH, the Lahti University of Applied Sciences and materials sensor equipment manufacturer Spectral Engines have developed a technology for automated sorting of waste textiles. LSJH is currently running a pilot processing plant that aims to accelerate the textile circular economy. Sorting of waste textiles is a manual process now.Recognition technology based on an infrared sensor is familiar in sorting plastic packaging, but it is new in textile recycling, according to LSJH project engineer Jaakko Zitting, who was part of the team that developed the technology.The goal is to create a facility that will be able to use the new infrared sensor to process all discarded textiles from Finland as well as textile waste from abroad, according to a report by a Finnish public service media company.So far waste textiles have been manually sorted in Finland as well as in other parts of Europe. This means that workers check labels to identify different kinds of materials. However labels can be inaccurate or may even be missing at times. This becomes problematic given that industries using recycled fibres to manufacture new products need to be certain of the raw material they are using.The optical recognition technology under development will improve the reliability of identification of fibres in fabrics and will help ensure better quality textile products, LSJH said in a statement.The technology will be deployed this autumn. Different fibres will be used for different products, with better quality material reserved for thread that could be used to manufacture new clothing. Recycled fibre can also be used for purposes such as composite products or even insulation material.Textile recycling is only possible if the entire textiles value chain is aligned with the circular economy, i.e., if recycled fibres are used to bring new products to the market. It is therefore of utmost important to find new businesses that want to utilise recycled fibres to develop new products, said LSJH project leader and circular economy specialist Sini Ilmonen.Funding for the processing plant was provided by municipal waste facilities and the Ministry of employment and economy. Additionally, public funding agency Business Finland contributed a €1.5-million investment grant. (DS)",United States,2019.09
273,"India will grow 'sustainably', says Prakash Javadekar","India will grow sustainably and at the same time ensure its citizens get the benefits of development, Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar told a United Nations forum here.

Speaking at the 'Setting the context for the industry transition programme' at the Climate Action Summit on Saturday, he underscored Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Zero Defect Zero Effect' model where no products have defects and their production has no adverse effects on the environment.

""My country is on (a) growth trajectory. I can't deny justice to my people (of wanting to develop). And we will grow, we want to grow sustainably,"" Javadekar said.

The Climate Action Summit, hosted by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, aims to boost action to implement the 2016 Paris Agreement. It will focus on nine interdependent tracks, which will be led by 19 countries and aided by international organisations.

The coalition on transforming industry is being led by India and Sweden.

Javadekar said the nine tracks will help nations in efforts to achieve the goals set under the Paris Agreement.

The minister told the forum that while carbon capture and storing has been discussed for years, it has not fructified to the extent it should have.

He said in a first a campus is coming up in India which will capture carbon. ""There will be carbon emission which will be trapped and used as raw material in other factories. That is a big thing,"" he said.

Javadekar elaborated on India's six-dollar-a-ton carbon tax, calling it a carrot and stick policy.

""So the industry starts thinking in the way of how we can avoid coal consumption and how we can come up with other solutions,"" he said, adding India is probably the only country with such a policy.

The minister said the lowest carbon emission cement industry is in India.

He lauded the improvements made in India's cement sector, especially in process technologies, more efficient raw material blending, high efficiency classified files, improved process control and management systems, better raw material selection.

He said the Indian aviation industry was fast switching to biofuels.

""Our first successful flight from Dehradun to Delhi flew on biofuel ethanol. We are making more progress in that direction,"" he said.

The minister said now plans were afoot to fly Boeing planes with biofuel and ""we will succeed I'm very sure.""

Javadekar said energy intensity (the measure of energy inefficiency) in the country has been brought down and that the results were for all to see.

Later, he elaborated on the national policy of resource efficiency and circular economy concept.

He said there is tremendous push by the Indian government on e-mobility and is giving related tax concessions.

He said Euro 6 compliant vehicles will be in the market by April 2020.

""It's a huge investment in fuel. So, we are moving around with really ambitious targets. And we are on the road,"" he said.

Use of better quality inputs have resulted in gradual reduction of energy consumption in the steel sector as well, he said.

He said the government's ""Perform, Achieve and Trade"" initiative has covered 478 energy intensive industries.

The minister said many Indian industries are part of the carbon disclosure project and have begun adopting science-based targets.

He said these examples of public policy intervention and public private partnerships have been successful in reducing emission of Indian industries.

""However, efforts need to be scaled up because the challenge is global and large,"" he said.

Javadekar stressed that many countries have profited through historical emissions and these nations must now take more responsibility to address the climate challenges. He suggested technological and financial solutions.

On technology, he said there will always be new innovations coming up which will reduce energy intensity and raise efficiency and these technologies need to be made available.

""All these measures have very important critical elements. And if government is supporting innovation, the society is supporting innovation, the innovation will not be bogged down in intellectual property rights, but will be available to the world because we are mitigating a disaster,"" he said.

He further stressed there should not be a case of profiteering as motive in the case of technology transfer for tackling climate change.

""And so my submission is that if we really want to achieve (our targets), we have to address these two important issues because the world is suffering.""

On products which are produced through environmentally-friendly means but are more expensive than their environmentally-degrading substitutes, Javadekar said, ""the world has seen that organic food and vegetables fetch more price. Why can't industrial products do that? If we address all these issues...we will come out with certain different solutions.""",United States,2019.09
277,Circular Economy,"Our current economic model relies on the conventional linear economy, which follows the pattern of creation, consumption and disposal of products. However, this linear economy is not sustainable. It leads to an increasing pressure on finite resources and generates significant waste, pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The circular economy offers an alternative way. It seeks to extract the maximum value from resources in use and keeps materials in circulation for as long as possible. It aims to minimize the environmental and social impacts, as well as to reduce economical costs and create jobs.

Circular economy prioritizes regenerative resources as material inputs and making the most out of existing resources and materials. According to Ellen MacArthur Foundation, it is based on three principles: design out waste and pollution, keep products and materials in use, regenerate natural systems. Main pillars of action are known as the 3 R's: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.



The circular model builds economic, natural, and social capital. The transition from linear economy to circular economy can put economic growth on a sustainable pathway.



In recent years, the circular economy has gained increasing prominence as a tool which presents solutions to some of the world's most pressing crosscutting sustainable development challenges. The circular economy holds particular promise for achieving multiple Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations Agenda 2030 established in 2015.

For the aviation sector, circular economy is an emerging concept and while its application is still not widespread, the utilization of circular economy concepts could already provide valuable environmental, social and economic opportunities. Circular economy has potential to reshape the whole supply chain from product design to end-of-life management.

Aviation already utilizes some of the concepts associated with circular economy. It is mainly focusing on three components of aviation: aircrafts, flights and aerodromes. Manufacturers, airlines and airports are already involved in the process and more are expected in the future. Numerous opportunities exist, such as reusing and recycling End-of-life (EoL) aircraft materials, reducing and valorizing waste during flights and in ground infrastructures (food, packaging, municipal solid waste, construction and demolition debris), reducing energy, water and raw material consumption.

It is also strengthening its goals to drive down packaging emissions, use more recycled materials in its plastic packaging and improve recycling solutions in its key markets.

“From our standpoint as a consumer products good company, we have a significant role to play to help reduce plastic waste,” says Kim Marotta, global senior director of corporate responsibility at Molson Coors.
• None participating in recycling solutions to increase recycling rates or reduce waste in priority markets.
• In addition, the strategy includes plans to move from a five-layer PET bottle to a three-layer bottle in the US to enhance its recyclability

While plastics comprise less than 2% of global packaging mix by weight, the company seeks to achieve at least 30% recycled content in its PET bottles, plastic film wrap and plastic rings.

Marotta says the company is exploring new technology such as working with Loop Industries, whose breakthrough technology allows for all types of waste PET plastic to be upcycled into high purity, food-grade PET plastic.

“So for instance with our PET bottles, we’re looking to upcycle them into PET bottles again,” she says. “We will conduct a test pilot, which will help build innovation in the U.S. and eventually in Germany.”

The company has joined The Recycling Partnership, a group of 45 brands promoting more jobs in the circular economy, more material recovery and stronger, more equitable communities within the US. As a multinational company, Molson Coors is also taking the commitment global. The company has signed on to the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, which is a worldwide initiative led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in collaboration with UN Environment that addresses plastic pollution and waste at its source by applying circular economy principles.

“When we look at recycling and the need to move the needle, it’s important for companies to innovate and also important for consumers to engage and respond,” Marotta says. “We have to do so many things to create change and part of the problem with recycling is that it’s complicated and just isn’t getting done. When we partner with other industries, NGOs and governments to create change, we think it’s a really important thing to do so.”",United States,2019.09

However, it wasn’t a typical day at the beach.

These visitors were on a mission to keep the beach free of trash — especially plastic.

Saturday is the International Coastal Cleanup day, and Tybee hosted its own event near the Pier.

The coastal cleanup day was a joint effort from the University of Georgia (UGA) Marine Extension and Georgia Sea Grant, Coca-Cola United, Tybee Clean Beach Volunteers and the Georgia River Network.

At least 100 volunteers armed with green buckets searched the beach for about two hours in the search for items that didn’t belong on the shores — from plastic bottles to left-behind kites and cigarette butts.

“The cigarette butts alone, the numbers are just staggering,” Tim Arnold of Tybee Clean Beach Volunteers said.

“We’ve picked up, that we’ve counted for the last two and a half years, over 300,000,” he told News 3.

The main goal of today’s cleanup event was to help the local community play an important role in a global effort to keep the coastlines free of garbage and plastic that can harm marine life.

“You see the trash getting into our wetlands, all along our beaches, and we’re finding those in organisms,” Luke Roberson, the adopted wetland coordinator for UGA Marine Extension and Georgia Sea Grant said.

“They’re very, very small, so even these bits that we’re picking up today can break down into smaller bits and find their way into marine organisms,” he said.

Employees from Coca-Cola, which sponsors the Ocean Conservancy and the International Coastal Cleanup, were out on the beach with volunteers sporting T-shirts made of recycled plastic.

“The Coca-Cola World Without Waste program is trying to create a circular economy, so if something seems like it’s waste and it’s not, like a plastic bottle, we can collect those, chip them down, and turn them into thread to make garments like this one,” Rena Stricker, executive director for the Georgia River Network said as she gestured toward her Coke T-shirt.

“This is made out of three Dasani bottles. So, that’s pretty cool!” Stricker said.

Cleanup volunteers told News 3 that keeping trash off the beach where they and their families come to enjoy themselves is important to them.

“Me and my kids like to have fun, and you shouldn’t want where you have fun at to be trashy,” volunteer Valencia Hollis said.

“It’s something that you should want to do, because it’s your way of helping keep the environment clean, it’s your way of making a difference.”",United States,2019.09

286,Considerations for conscious consumers - 11 things to bear in mind when shopping,"There are many things to consider when shopping with the environment in mind, from how the product is made to how it is shipped, and whether or not you really need it in the first place...

⬤ Consider needs over wants: Is it just an impulse purchase or something of real value to your life? How many of us own too much stuff that we don't actually need or value?

⬤ If you decide that you or your family need the product then choose carefully and slowly.

⬤ On big ticket items such as transport, white goods, homes, etc, consider carefully the cost of ownership over the whole life of the product. That is: how much for purchase, running costs, service, maintenance costs and end-of-life value/refurbishment vs disposal costs, and also the cost to the environment.

⬤ Do you need to own it or would you be better leasing, renting or sharing it?

⬤ Think about the provenance of the product (that is, where it was made, who made it, how it was shipped to you, what it is made from and where it will go after you are finished using it).

⬤ In design terms we talk about designing for the circular economy. This means keeping materials in closed loop cycles so we get maximum value from high-tech materials.

Renewable materials are great as long as we don't mix them with the valuable, technical ones, and that we grow at least as much as we use while minimising the impact on the planet's biodiversity.

⬤ The 'use' phase of most products and services often has the highest impact on the natural environment, but also on the built environment and on human and animal health. Think about emissions (not only CO2), off-gassing, use of dangerous consumables and where the power/heat is coming from.

⬤ Build up a knowledge of trusted brands and their sustainability credentials. No brand is perfect, but some are more transparent and trustworthy than others.

⬤ Beware of greenwashing - ie, brands that sell products and services based on limited or single feature sustainability credentials. The more environmentally/socially conscious brands tend to have a long history of effort and transparency when marketing their products and services. Ask and be curious if you aren't sure.

⬤ There are no 'good' and 'bad' products and services, just ones that impact more and ones that impact less on biodiversity, human health and the climate, so choose consciously.

⬤ There are no easy choices, but we have never had more choice. All 'greener' products and service use should facilitate conscious effort to change, limit consumption patterns and put the natural environment and society above individual gratification. It's not about feeling bad about living, many enjoy living a more examined simpler, slower life.",United States,2019.09

291,Closing the Loop,"[This article is part of our week of climate change coverage, through which we hope to build awareness, dialogue and action around the topic as our alpine communities become increasingly impacted.]

The Circular Economy: whether it’s the latest buzzword in sustainability or a term here to stay, its concepts are important in reducing our impacts to an amount the earth can sustain.

A circular economy is an industrial system that is restorative and regenerative by design. Renewable energy is used, materials are sustainably sourced, and there is no pollution. Traditionally, we have made our ski equipment from unsustainable materials, using non-renewable energy and disposing in landfills when we’re done. This linear economy (using virgin materials to make products that end up in landfills) is inefficient. A circular economy maximizes efficiencies and eliminates waste by keeping products in use as long as possible (through repair) and reusing materials to the greatest extent viable.

Unless we decide to make a cool ski fence or snowboard bench from old equipment, we need to create solutions where products are reused or repurposed at the end of their life. About three million skis and a million snowboards are sold annually. If a company sells X pairs of skis per year, it needs to have an end-of-life plan for X pairs of skis per year, incorporating disassembly and recyclability into product design. Niche Snowboards, for example, sells snowboards specifically designed for recyclability and is establishing a take-back program to collect snowboards for recycling.

There are a few ways that brands can begin to transition to a circular economy. Life-cycle assessments can determine the environmental impacts of a product’s life and identify priority areas in which to take action. Brands can consider swapping out high-impact materials with those of a lower impact—in skis and snowboards, that looks like using basalt and wood instead of fiberglass; bio-epoxies and bio-plastics instead of petro-chemicals; and, most importantly, the use of more recycled materials. Edges can be constructed from recycled steel, and sidewalls can be created from recycled ABS plastic.

Beyond hardgoods, apparel is making its own strides. Fjällräven’s Re-Wool products use recycled wool collected from leftover yarn and wool from factories. Unifi Textiles supplies Polartec, Patagonia, The North Face, prAna and many more with polyester derived from more than 10 billion plastic bottles to date.

Reducing impacts while maintaining quality and managing costs is a great challenge but has enormous opportunities. Innovation is key, involving new ways of thinking and doing business. Partnerships are important, because solving these problems isn’t possible alone. The efficiencies that become possible with circularity in the consumer goods sector could bring cost savings of $700 billion per year and increase business resiliency.

As consumers, we can influence companies’ responses to the urgency of crises we face. Let’s let our favorite brands know the time is now to make big changes and invest in renewables, reduce packaging, offer more opportunities for product repair and design products for recyclability.

And on an individual level, instead of replacing that worn down hoody, let’s try to patch the holes.

292,Circular economy: Towards zero,"It all started when a video of a turtle with a plastic straw stuck in its nose went viral. In the video — which is quite upsetting to watch — you can see scientists removing the straw from the injured turtle, whose eyes are closed in pain, blood streaming down its face.

That 2015 incident sparked a plastic straw ban around the world, including in Malaysia, which saw the grassroots-driven Tak Nak Straw and Zero Waste movement grow. Over the years, this movement has opened up a new market for businesses that want to serve the growing number of environmentally conscious consumers.

Zero Waste Malaysia (ZWM) is one organisation that has fuelled this growth. From a Facebook group started by enthusiasts in 2016, it had grown into a non-profit organisation with more than 20,000 members last year, according to its 2018 annual report.

“We started the group to share resources among those interested in sustainable living. It then came to a point where some people wanted to start package-free stores. By 2017, there were six or seven package-free zero-waste stores in the Klang Valley,” co-founder Khor Sue Yee told Enterprise on the sidelines of the Zero Waste Festival. Now, there are more than 500 zero-waste-

ZWM’s goal is to increase awareness of sustainable living. One of its founders, Aurora Tin, is known for blogging about her experience practising the zero-waste lifestyle. In two years, the amount of trash produced by her family could fit into a 500ml glass jar and weighed less than 100g.

Going zero waste means rejecting the disposable culture and practising environmentally responsible habits. The world is already buckling under the amount of waste produced. According to a 2018 report by The World Bank, global waste could grow 70% by 2050 under a business-as-usual scenario. Plastic is one of the key culprits and as recent reports have shown, we do not have sufficient resources to deal with it.

To provide guidance, ZWM has produced a Zero Waste Event Handbook to advise event organisers on how they can avoid generating waste. It has also published a list of vendors who have worked with the organisation.

Last year, ZWM produced the online Zero Waste Map, which lists all the zero-waste-related stores — such as package-free stores, repair services and community composting sites — in Malaysia.

At its recent festival, ZWM announced its intention to start offering zero waste certifications to businesses. This initiative was born out of inquiries on the quality of package-free stores.

“We were inspired by Zero Waste Saigon and Zero Waste France. Both non-profit organisations provide zero-waste certifications to businesses, schools and stakeholders who practise sustainability as a core part of their value to achieve a circular economy,” says Khor.

It is important to provide this level of transparency to ensure that the zero-waste stores are practising what they preach, she adds. “We are planning the launch in July. It will start by taking a pledge [to be zero waste] and we will do the audit later. Before that, our team members need to meet some criteria to be able to do the audit.”

The number of package-free bulk stores have rapidly increased in the Klang Valley in the last three years. These shops allow customers to purchase items such as dry food and personal care products without packaging.

Is this an emerging business opportunity? Perhaps, but it is still in its infancy and full of challenges, according to the entrepreneurs who spoke at a forum titled “A dialogue on local package-free business practices”.

For instance, Clytia Wong, founder of BYOB (Bring Your Own Bottle) Damansara Kim, started the package-free detergent store in 2012 in collaboration with the late Wilson Lai, who was a detergent manufacturer for two decades.

They had noticed that at recycling centres, detergent bottles were the most common plastic being disposed of. But that kind of plastic is very sturdy and can be reused multiple times. Also, if you send plastic for recycling there are additional carbon footprint and financial costs incurred in the process.

Reusing plastic bottles became the logical solution. So, Lai decided to sell detergent to customers who brought their own containers to the shop. He recruited Wong as one of the retailers. But this was before the zero waste movement began in Malaysia. They started with seven outlets but in less than two years, only two were left standing.

“Everyone had just learnt about recycling. So, when we told them to reuse, they did not understand. Initially, we had to give free bottles. But they still came back without the bottle. It was very tough for the first three years,” says Wong.

It was only when news on plastic waste became viral that awareness rose, she adds. Now, BYOB has four locations in Malaysia.

“I think the turtle did a good job. That image is stuck in everyone’s mind. From then on, we felt like the market has really become more acceptable and we have more bulk stores coming up,” says Wong.

The same goes for Claire Sancelot, founder of The Hive Bulk Foods. She sells more than 300 whole foods and household products in bulk without packaging. She started in 2015 and lost money in the first two years of business. But things turned around last year. Now, she has four outlets in the Klang Valley and recently opened the fifth in Taman Tun Dr Ismail in Kuala Lumpur.

“In those two years, I did not know if I would be able to manage. It was so hard explaining to each customer how the business works and why we were doing it. I still do not draw a salary now, although every employee is paid. But I am very optimistic that we will get there,” says Sancelot.

It may be odd, but these entrepreneurs have a vision that in 10 years, package-free stores like theirs will not exist anymore, that the concept will have become mainstream. Imagine a Tesco or NSK with a package-free section. This is already available in some supermarkets in France.

“When there is more demand for package-free stores, I hope people in the retail industry will do something about it so it becomes a norm. Right now, we are here to create awareness and demand,” says Wong.

Some may complain that package-free stores, most of which are currently located in more affluent areas, are expensive. It is still a conscious choice made by discerning customers who can afford it. But this is merely a matter of economies of scale, say the panellists at the forum. The greater the demand, the lower the cost.

“It is really about getting support from the community. Without them, the business cannot sustain. For the big corporates to adopt this strategy, it needs to make a profit,” says Law Hong Mei, founder of The Olive Tree, a natural skincare product store. It has a package-free outlet in Kota Damansara.

“When there is demand, there will be supply. When there are more consumers requesting it from big manufacturers, they will look into it,” she points out.

While the zero waste movement has been grassroots-driven so far, policies can provide scale to these businesses and make a difference. Already, several state governments have policies on plastic bags and straws.

What else can the governments do? The panellists suggested providing loans to small businesses or giving tax allowances to those in the sustainable business space.

How to transform into a zero-waste shop

Law is different from the other panellists in that her business started as a normal store selling natural skincare products. A year after founding the company, she began her personal zero waste journey and sought to implement that in the company.

The Olive Tree’s products are manufactured in Australia. When shipped to Malaysia, they tend to come with a lot of packaging. The company also delivers to customers, which results in another round of plastic and cardboard waste.

Law decided to make a difference. She set up a package-free concept store at Sunway Nexis for customers to refill their liquid products and buy soaps without packaging. Customers can also refill their products at package-free stores such as The Hive and Frangipani.

“We are responsible for all the bottles as well. That is why we ask people to bring back their [The Olive Tree] bottles and we will reward them with RM1 this year. We have done it for a year and the number is growing. Up to 30% of our bottles come back. We also clean these and send them to The Hive or Frangipani. That is the amazing part about our zero waste community. All of us accept each other’s trash because we have use for it,” says Law.

The delivery service took a bit of a change in strategy. “I went to look at how people were sending their parcels. Although 90% were using plastic mailers, I could still see some boxes around. I became determined to send out all our parcels in boxes,” she says.

The Olive Tree custom-makes its boxes using recycled paper and excludes plastic from the packaging. It works with suppliers to find non-plastic or foam alternatives. Some of Law’s colleagues were worried that the shampoo bottles would break or get wet without a plastic wrapper around the box. But she insisted.

“We were also worried that our parcels would get wet. Well, the postman’s job is to keep your parcel safe. When they see that your boxes are made of paper, they will put it somewhere under the roof. If they see that it is wrapped in plastic, they will put it outside. It is all about mentality,” says Law.

How to keep a store zero waste

One challenge package-free stores face is finding suppliers that are willing to provide goods without packaging. This is easier to achieve when the suppliers are local or if the businesses manufacture the products themselves.

“Our favourite is [sourcing] from local makers because it is easier for us to deal with them. For example, we produce very good vegetarian pasta and soy sauce in Malaysia. We can ask the manufacturers to send the goods to our stores, which will go directly into containers. Or we can do an exchange of containers with them. After using the containers, we wash and return them. They will fill these containers and send them to us again,” says Oh Kai Siang, founder of A Bit Less package-free store.

Some suppliers are reluctant to work with these businesses because of the small order sizes. This was especially true in the beginning, says Sancelot. “I only had two suppliers then and no one else wanted to do it. But now, new suppliers are coming to us. We have more options.”

Sometimes, the stores have to educate buyers who ask for delivery. For example, to be zero waste, The Hive wraps its items with reused materials. “It does not look pretty. And clients want pretty things. So, there is a lot of education to be done here. When you order from The Hive, the product will arrive looking a bit strange,” says Sancelot.

But what about food that cannot be grown in Malaysia, such as nuts and grains? For those, Oh opts to exchange containers with the suppliers or buy in bulk so that it only uses one huge plastic bag. It either reuses the plastic or puts it in Ecobricks, which are reusable bricks made of plastic.

How to keep zero-waste stores affordable

Goods sold in package-free stores should be cheaper since they do not have an extra layer of packaging. That may be a logical conclusion that some may draw. But in reality, the prices are often on a par with the market. That is because these stores have to deal with higher labour and transport costs. They are also small and can only work with a limited number of suppliers.

For BYOB, being the manufacturer of goods keeps prices low. But it incurs the cost of sending the reusable containers to the factory and the shop, among other expenses. To make it sustainable, customers must buy at least a litre of detergent.

“I had people who brought a Vitagen-sized bottle to refill. It will cost us more and waste manpower to do that, so we said no. Your usual detergent bottle is one litre anyway. We practise this so we can maintain the price for everyone in the long run,” says Wong.

Maintaining a package-free store actually requires a huge amount of manpower, the panellists point out. To ensure the freshness of food products, the staff have to keep the products in glass jars, cold rooms or air-tight containers.

“Everything comes in bulk, so you need someone to carry the huge package into the storage area. You need to transfer a small amount into the glass jar on the shelf to keep everything fresh. You also have to hire someone who can educate customers. It is tricky when we determine prices. We usually get retail prices from suppliers and scale it down to make it more competitive,” says Oh.

Sancelot tries to match her prices with those of supermarkets that sell similar products, which are usually the likes of Village Grocer or Jasons Food Hall. “We are trying to make it cheaper, but our margins are scarily low,” she says.

One issue to consider is whether the stores should sell only organic products because these tend to be more expensive. Oh says it has decided to do so because non-organic products are already available in bulk elsewhere.

Cheryl Anne Low, founder of Nude the Zero Waste Store, has chosen to offer a mixture of both because she wants to ensure the affordability of the products. “We think zero waste should not only be for those who can afford it. In the future, we will carry more organic items so long as they are affordable,” she says.

Pushing for zero waste in the mainstream

When Vietnamese restaurant n Viet stopped providing straws a few years ago, a few of the staff quit because they could not handle the backlash. “They were constantly scolded by customers: ‘Why are you being cheap?’ But we persevered. Today, it is becoming more acceptable,” says Valerie Tan, brand manager of Real Food People Sdn Bhd, which owns the restaurant.

Ong Ning Geng, founder of Chocolate Concierge, who uses Malaysian cacao beans to produce single-origin chocolate products, faced a similar pushback when he tried to get rid of paper bags. “Two months ago, I stopped giving shopping bags, not even paper ones. I got a lot of flak. They asked, ‘Why aren’t you providing me with a bag?’ No amount of explanation could save that situation and I was forced to provide paper bags made of the thinnest material. I had to do that because I rank customer satisfaction very highly,” he says.

These experiences reflect that mentality is one of the biggest challenges companies face when trying to promote sustainability practices. Tan and Ong were among the panellists at the Zero Waste Festival event titled “Sustainable Business Forum”.

Doris Chin, general manager of Element by Westin Kuala Lumpur, had that experience when her team made the two-year-old hotel sustainable. One of their initiatives was ridding the rooms of drinking water in plastic bottles. Instead, it installed a good-quality filter on the water tap.

“We had a lot of resistance in the year we opened the hotel. TripAdvisor pushed my hotel ranking down to No 85. People put us down there because they could not accept it,” says Chin.

“It took a lot of education. When you turn on the television, the second slide tells you why we do not have plastic bottles and why we have installed the water filter. We also talked to guests in the lobby. Today, our ranking is back up to No 17.”

You should not give up because customers will eventually be glad to participate in your conservation efforts, she adds.

Tan introduced the Zero Food Waste Hero concept at n Viet a year ago. Under the initiative, customers can choose their portion size and top up at no extra cost. For every meal that is finished, the restaurant will donate 10 sen to the Food Aid Foundation, which distributes food to those in need.

“We focus on three waste reduction methods. One is that we will observe what is being wasted on the table. For example, we used to serve fermented shrimp paste, but 95% of it got thrown away. So, we just removed it. Second, basil is very important for pho but some people cannot take the strong taste. It is wasted when served. That is why we decided to do an experiment at our Sunway Pyramid outlet,” says Tan.

n Viet put a basil plant on each table, with a sign that tells customers to take what they need. “This really reduces food waste and it is as fresh as it gets,” she says.

Food delivery — which is all the rage now — is another practice that produces a lot of packaging waste. “But I have seen that some restaurants have the option to exclude cutlery or sauces. From the restaurants’ end, they can look at biodegradable packaging options rather than plastic. Delivery has a higher carbon footprint than dining at the outlet. So, consumers must make that choice,” says Tan.

The same goes for the bubble tea trend, which is creating a lot of plastic waste. “We will not be able to stop that trend, but we can bring our own bottles. Or [companies] can be like Starbucks, which gives you a rebate when you bring your tumbler,” he says.

How to bring zero waste to tourism

Chin, a two-decade veteran of the hospitality industry, was struck by the practicality of sustainability in tourism when she was assigned to convert a resort by the Gunung Mulu National Park in Sarawak. She followed a guide into the park.

“Before we left, he told us that we had to bring out whatever we take into the park. Do not leave any trash in the national park. The guides are trained to protect the national park, landfills and ecosystem. Education is important. Eventually, they removed all the bins in Gunung Mulu. I was so impressed. If people could do it in a remote location in Sarawak, why not in the big city?” says Chin.

Now, Element recycles leftover soap bars from rooms for other cleaning purposes. Shampoo and body wash are filled in dispensers instead of bottles. Body lotion is put in biodegradable bottles.

Unfortunately, the cap of the body lotion bottle is still plastic. “We are in discussions with plants in China about creating a biodegradable cap and even a biodegradable plastic wrapper around the soap,” says Chin.

How to introduce local chocolates to Malaysians

The distance most chocolate bars travel before making their way to tropical countries is peculiar. Cacao beans can only be planted in the tropical belt, but it is shipped thousands of miles to somewhere in Europe, for instance, where it is turned into chocolate bars, then flown back to be sold in tropical countries.

“The last leg of the journey is quite painful. It is air-flown back under refrigerated conditions. The carbon footprint for chocolate is beyond what you pay for it in dollars,” says Ong.

Part of his interest in this came from his desire to try single-origin chocolate from Malaysia. The country has its own cacao farmers, but why aren’t there more locally produced chocolate brands?

“We have consumers in Malaysia and we have cacao farmers. Why isn’t anyone connecting the dots? That is why I started Chocolate Concierge,” says Ong.

The company provides chocolates to fine dining restaurants in Malaysia and Singapore. Ong wants to put his products in packaging-free stores so customers can purchase using their own containers. This is already available at its outlet in Bangsar Shopping Centre, where he encourages customers to bring their own boxes.",United States,2019.09
294,Clothes For Life: New Outdoor Brand Commits To Make Clothes Last | Textile World,"LONDON — September 19, 2019 — The London Waste and Recycling Board (LWARB) and QSA Partners have today announced the first major milestone in their Circular Fashion Fast Forward project, as Full Stack Supply Co launches a new premier outdoor clothing brand, FW, pronounced “forward”.

FW is one of a number of brands working with LWARB and QSA on the Circular Fashion Fast Forward project, funded by the C&A Foundation as a part of their Bridging the Gap initiative. FW recognizes that incorporating circular economy practices is key to future-proofing their business; so the company’s new range of clothes has been designed to help put an end to throw-away consumerism, emphasizing durable, high-quality construction and materials to ensure the garments last and last.

The real innovation however — a result of tailored business model development from LWARB and QSA — is that customers will be able to repair their clothing if needed. Through a dedicated service designed to make clothes last longer, customers will have the option of having garments repaired for free within a warranty period. Repairs will still be available to customers at a low cost beyond the warranty period.

A repair service is one of several models companies may integrate into their business to create more value and profit, whilst reducing their environmental impact. Repairing products helps to keep them in use for longer and builds loyalty with the customer. By repairing every garment it can, FW is selling clothes that could be worn for life. This is an important move away from the usual practice of simply disposing of clothes when they become damaged.

As people are waking up to the impacts of their shopping habits and increasingly demanding more sustainable options from the brands they love, a growing number of businesses are implementing alternatives to the current high-impact ‘take, make, dispose’ business model.

Olivia Herbert, head of operations at FW said: “The business model advice from LWARB and QSA has been essential. It has helped us to understand the circular models that best fit with our rapidly-growing business and our high performance, forward-thinking apparel for alpine living. We know that we’re just starting out on our journey to take our place in the circular economy and we’re delighted to be global leaders on the expedition.” LWARB and QSA Partners are taking FW, Ted Baker, Farfetch and one other global brand on a journey to explore circular economy business models, as part of the C&A Foundation Bridging the Gap initiative. Each brand wants to match their ambition for greater sustainability with their customers’ needs and values. At the end of the project, each will have tested the best circular business model for both their business and their customers.

“The aim of our project is to demonstrate how the circular economy can help brands to hit their environmental and economic targets and succeed in today’s marketplace. We are working with several market players across the fashion sector to illustrate the competitive advantage of circular business models. And how they can help to build not just a more sustainable business but customer loyalty too.”",United States,2019.09
295,Why Has Recycling Becoming so Complicated?,"Environmentalists were prepared last week to celebrate the passing of landmark legislation entitled the California Circular Economy and Plastic Pollution Reduction Act. Senate Bill 54 and Assembly Bill 1080 promised to break through the state’s recycling crisis.

Despite overcoming intense resistance from various quarters, the bills were not addressed by lawmakers at the close of session on Saturday, September 14. The effort to ban 75 percent of single use plastic and the barring of plastic products and packaging with no known recycling value had the potential to create a model for the rest of the country to manage and substantially reduce the glut of plastics in the recycling industry and the troublesome byproduct of pollution of the ocean and waterways with plastic refuse and microplastics.

Plastics. That storied word reverberates today as the global production of plastics, one of the world’s worst sources of pollution, has surpassed 300 million tons per year. A mere single-digit percentage is ever recycled. In addition, China’s decision last year to turn away most of the paper and plastic it was traditionally processing has created an enormous backlog of materials at Materials Recovery Facilities (MRFs) and the shutting down of smaller private run companies that can no longer find profitable markets.

The solution is complex. Professor of Resource Management and Sustainability Practitioner Victoria Charles states that the disconnect between producers and waste haulers is the key to understanding the problem. SB 54 and AB 1080 were far-reaching pieces of legislation in the search for a solution and would have forced that conversation.

“The lifecycle of a product starts with what resource managers call ’upstream’, the manufacturers, themselves. The producers employ designers who come up with nifty new and convenient ways to provide attractive, affordable, convenient and brand-affirming packaging and products.”

According to Charles, some of the new packaging seen on grocery store shelves is evidence of manufacturers seeking to “go green” by employing a variety of bioplastics in their packaging trying to demonstrate the environmental cred of their brand. Unfortunately, without taking into account the “end of life” of their products and packaging, their use of these new materials far outpaces the capacity of our current plastic recovery systems—the “downstream”—in waste hauling facilities. In fact that burden is increasingly put upon the consumers who end up with the dilemma of “can I recycle this?”

Earnest consumers often engage in “wish-cycling”—toss the item in the recycle bin and hope that it doesn’t go to the landfill, giving that plastic item perhaps one more chance at becoming converted into a recycled end product. That squeezable single-serve applesauce container, that compostable food tray or that biodegradable plasticware that claims a six-month breakdown life? When tossed in the recycling bin these materials only pollute the plastics separation process at the MRFs—and end up being tossed in the landfill anyway.

Until our legislatures can pass measures that seriously address this disconnect, there are some things that consumers can continue to pay attention to:
• None Focus on what you purchase. Although living a plastic-free life can be nearly impossible (see Kait Leonard’s article on page 23) you can consciously reduce
• None Be aware and avoid single-use plastics. Carry your own utensils, use a refillable water bottle, bring your insulated container for that stop at Starbucks.
• None Be aware of composite materials. Plastic windows in paper envelopes, plastic insert in tissue boxes, paper cups that are insulated with light styrofoam coatings. Unless you can separate the materials these all go in the trash and are not recyclable.
• None Textiles—clothing, towels, old blankets—don’t go in the trash. Take them to a USAgain bin or similar bin collection spots that will recycle the materials appropriately. (There is one on the Topanga Community Center grounds.)
• None Paperbacks and hardcover books can be dropped off at the local library.
• None Eyeglasses can also be taken to most libraries and are collected as well by Walmart and most optometrist’s offices.
• None Here’s a weird one. Do you flush your used contacts like approximately 45 million others do.
• None Batteries should not be discarded in the trash bin; they can be recycled at Best Buy outlets and at electronics and hazardous waste collection locations. There is a monthly collection in Calabasas, see our Calendar
• None Plastic bags and film from packaging cannot be disposed of in recycling bins. This includes newspaper sleeves, bread bags, dry-cleaning bags, food storage bags, plastic shipping envelopes, bubble wrap and air pillows, and product wrap on cases of water and soda bottles, paper towels, etc. This type of plastic jams up machines at MRFs. When this plastic is recycled separately it is turned into plastic pellets that are used by a variety of companies creating recycled material packaging or even solid decking material. Save these items separately and then drop off at a participating grocery store such as Sprouts or Ralphs.
• None Do not drop off your recyclables into your recycling bin while enclosed in a plastic garbage bag. Open the bag and empty the contents or you risk having the entire bag pushed to the landfill section. Plastic bags as described above, jam up the recycling equipment used to sort.
• None Get familiar with the CalRecycle website. According to Charles, this has become one of the best resources for determining the proper disposition of all sorts of household and commercial waste materials.

306,Cleaning up plastic pollution in Africa,"Plastic waste pollution, aggravated by inefficient waste collection and limited recycling capabilities, is prevalent across Africa. However, the continent also has a growing, youthful population that values improving the quality of life and readily adopts technologies toward this end (1). This makes Africa especially suitable as a testbed to investigate the effectiveness of new technologies for solving environmental problems. In addition to consumers pushing brands to be more environmentally responsible, a business case also exists in Africa that enables brands to invest in technologies that promote a circular economy. As such, a trend for plastic waste remediation efforts in Africa that relies principally on consumer engagement to create a plastics circular economy has emerged (2).

Over 416 billion plastic bags per month are used globally (3). In Africa, they litter roads, rivers, boreholes, and sewage systems. In many African countries, increasing plastic pollution has motivated policy-makers to enact legislation to protect the environment from further contamination. Currently, Africa has the highest percentage of countries (∼46%) with plastic bans (4). For example, in 2008, Rwanda took the global lead in banning nonbiodegradable polyethylene bags. The law prohibits the manufacture, use, import, and sale of nonbiodegradable bags that fall outside its sustainability criteria, and violations are punishable by high fines or jail time. It is strictly enforced at airports and other port entries by agents from the Rwanda Environment Management Authority. Tax incentives in Rwanda are motivating plastic bag manufacturers to consider recycling as a business opportunity. The policy has led to local production of sustainable bags made from local materials, alleviating fears about negative impact on small businesses, jobs, and foreign direct investment. Some African countries are following Rwanda's lead, albeit with less effective law enforcement. Tanzania is in the second phase of its plastic ban, and Kenya is following a gradual path by taxing plastic bags. Although Kenya implemented a plastic bag ban in 2017, punishable with fines and jail time, enforcement has been difficult. The tax has decreased consumer demand for single-use plastic shopping bags and increased the use of reusable alternatives. Kenya also is incentivizing community-led collection that is turning plastics into mattresses and eco-friendly asphalt, bricks, fencing posts, school bags, and shoes. Since its launch in Kenya in 2017, the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) has championed a Beat Plastic Pollution campaign across Africa, working with governments to establish programs to remediate plastic pollution. UNEP, which relies on voluntary commitments from government, industry, and citizens, has gained ∼2.5 million online commitments from all three groups. Many of the programs in Africa that limit the production of new, nonbiodegradable plastics have occurred in the last 4 years. Thus, there are few data about the efficacy of these programs and technological efforts to tackle plastic waste, but the engagement and public responses are encouraging. Although efforts to limit plastic use may reduce the introduction of new plastics into the environment, the need to address plastic pollution already present in Africa still remains.

Plastics pollution prevention in Africa is tightly coupled to the economics of recycling. Globally, about 90% of all waste is dumped or burned in low-income countries. In high-income regions, waste management is more regulated and recycling rates are higher (5). Available recycling solutions rely on a centralized location for returning plastic products. In African urban areas where formal waste collection and sorting infrastructure are available (primarily in city centers), new technologies for vehicle-based waste collection can improve collection efficiency. In one example, about 2500 metric tons of waste is generated daily in Nairobi, Kenya, but only ∼50% of the garbage is collected. Researchers at IBM Research–Africa developed tracking devices that enable garbage collection vehicle management. Data such as speed, tonnage of garbage loaded on vehicles, and driver behavior are gathered in real time. The system surveys events from multiple sensors embedded in workers' mobile phones and applies machine learning to the data (6). The resulting insights for fuel savings, better truck routes, and more efficient trash collection could help county officials expand services to meet waste collection targets. Waste sorting also is a key challenge. Waste collection bins developed in South Africa, called “smart bins” (7), are equipped with sensors, cameras, and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that recognize, classify, and sort different types of waste into compartments. These bins avoid overflow and enhance collection efficiency by signaling when filled with trash. Newer versions of the bins are paired with apps that send alerts to mobile phones to create awareness about recycling and provide redeemable rewards to encourage positive behavior. For example, points can be redeemed for cash or shopping. Smart bins with improved sorting efficiency are also being manufactured and used in the United States (8). Although this appears to be a promising, deployable technology for plastics sorting, prices will have to decrease for widespread adoption of smart bins. Such emerging technologies will improve processes associated with conventional recycling ecosystems. However, ever-increasing populations will stress these ecosystems, and new circular ecosystems for plastics recycling are beginning to appear in Africa's populous cities and surrounding areas.

The African population is expected to grow to 2.5 billion by 2050. Its most populous city, Lagos, Nigeria, is projected to grow to 32.6 million by that time (9, 10). In 2014, 12,000 tons of waste was generated daily by Lagos citizens, 15% of which was plastic (11). The overburdened Lagos municipality collected only about 40% of this total generated waste. Once collected, waste is taken to dumpsites and plastics are recycled manually in the budding recycling sector. Despite health and safety risks involved in this work, informal and formal waste reclaimers are a key component of waste management, not only in Lagos but across Africa. For example, waste workers are responsible for recycling 80 to 90% of the plastic packaging that is recycled in South Africa (12). Plastic recycling in Africa has focused on commodity plastics and is mainly centered on first-level processing (such as baling and shredding). Such processed plastic is then sold and exported to Asia, where it is down-cycled to products such as pillow stuffing. Although this extends the lifetime of materials, the process creates downcycled products that can no longer be recycled. The growing population and underutilization of plastic recycling makes Lagos an attractive market to build plastic recycling plants that process plastics to constituent materials. However, recyclers need capital to set up factories that have a guaranteed supply of waste, a stable power supply, working water treatment facilities, a skilled workforce, efficient ports, and easy access to markets for recycled plastic. Because these prerequisites are not readily available, building new recycling plants is not attractive to the average investor. Nevertheless, some intrepid private, foreign investors have successfully established thriving large recycling facilities in Lagos with guaranteed offtake of whatever recycled plastic is produced. If more new recycling plants are built, an opportunity will arise to leverage plastic recycling technologies that also adapt to the local infrastructure—that is, in places outside of urban centers where there are few roads for garbage truck-based collection. As for policies, Nigeria announced plans for a local plastic bag ban in 2013 that was enacted in 2019; however, enforcement of the new ban has been thus far ineffective. 



Collecting enough plastic waste to feed recycling plants is a continuous struggle anywhere in Africa. Formal collection infrastructure is still being developed across municipalities. The absence of policies to promote plastic recycling at-scale, coupled with limited road networks for general waste collection, little public awareness of plastic recycling, and an unstable global plastic recycling market, has stunted the adoption of recycling in several African cities, including Lagos, Nouakchott, and Monrovia, to name a few (13). Furthermore, plastic pollution has become commonplace in African communities where most residents live on less than $2.50 a day. Chronic flooding during the rainy season is routinely attributed to littered sachets that block drains. Sachets, which are made primarily of low-density polyethylene, are critical for distributing clean “sachet drinking water” and other affordable single-use personal products in Africa. The environmental conditions in poverty-stricken areas have serious consequences for residents, from missed work and loss of income when clogged drains flood, to the increase in malaria from mosquitoes in stagnant water. Thus, consumer participation in plastic recycling programs, motivated by aid with survival essentials by the government, can play a crucial role in successfully implementing a new plastics recycling infrastructure in Africa and at the same time improving overall quality of life. Startup companies that leverage consumer motivation have begun to address these societal and environmental issues in Africa. For example, Wecyclers, a recyclable collection business in Lagos (14), incentivizes neighborhoods to address improper waste management by rewarding subscribers who engage in plastic recycling. Door-to-door collection designed for informal settlements is combined with mobile applications, short message service (SMS) technology, and low-cost bicycle-powered collection vehicles. “Agents” gather recyclables directly from households, which receive points (based on weight) through SMS. Plastic waste is weighed, taken to neighborhood Wecyclers processing centers where it is sorted, baled, and then sold to recyclers. Points can be applied to the purchase of goods ranging from foodstuffs to appliances and even cash, thus improving the living standards of local households. Other recent examples of incentive-based recycling startups in Nigeria underscore the trend toward community-based recycling adoption in Africa. Two of these companies are RecyclePoints (15) and Chanja Datti (16), both founded in 2015. In these business models, collection is facilitated by individual “subscribers” and plastic is exchanged for cash or redeemable points. Mr. Green Africa, founded in 2014 and based in Nairobi, Kenya, leverages smart technology to support an ecosystem that comprises over 2000 waste collectors and has recycled more than 2000 tons of plastic waste to date, which is returned to plastics manufacturers (17). Plastic Bank is a social enterprise deployed in Asia, with plans to expand to South Africa. It employs blockchain technology for collecting and redistributing recycled plastic materials across networks, and partners with global chemical companies to reintroduce recycled plastic to the market (18). Also important for creating a circular plastics economy is the involvement of plastic manufacturers. Producers can create more easily recyclable plastic products and packaging, reduce plastic volumes in their designs, and replace virgin material with recycled content. Local manufacturers in Africa have begun to use plastic bottle waste for textile production, although collecting enough waste to sustain operations remains challenging. Corporations that profit from the plastic status quo must be incentivized to introduce these radical, but potentially cost-effective, changes. For example, this year the Africa Plastics Recycling Alliance was announced, in which local consumer goods companies committed to increasing recycled plastic content in packaging, thereby stimulating the local plastics recycling economy in Africa (19). A consumer-centered approach for waste collection that works together with plastics manufacturers and other stakeholders across the plastics supply chain can make it feasible for companies to have both a positive economic and environmental impact.

The rapid adoption of information technologies at various points along the plastic waste recycling chain can facilitate the realization of a closed-loop plastic waste ecosystem. Regional factors, such as government regulations and consumer motivation to improve African quality of life, play a critical role in the adoption of technologies to tackle plastic pollution in an environment that otherwise lacks a plastics recycling framework. Recently, application-centered startups in African cities and surrounding areas have spurred plastic waste collection from citizens in exchange for goods ranging from household items to cash. Combined with emerging technologies, this model has been effective in low-income areas in Africa. If deployed as a global recycling model, networks that leverage consumer participation will promote the availability of high-quality recycled materials that can be reintroduced into the market and close the plastics life-cycle loop.

311,Burger King is melting down plastic toys to recycle them into something actually useful,"Is there a love more fleeting than a child’s affection for a fast-food meal toy? One minute, it’s the coolest thing in the world. An hour later back at home, it’s stuffed between two couch cushions, forgotten and alone. As parents of small kids can attest, these meal toys are just complete garbage, no matter how many adult, ahem, enthusiasts review them online ( seriously, a million subscribers? ).

There’s been a lot of talk about plastic straws, but that’s not the only plastic waste spewing out of fast-feeders, and now Burger King has decided to remove all plastic toys from its kids’ meals. Not only that but the initiative, created by agency Jones Knowles Ritchie and starting this week in the U.K., is also calling for people to drop plastic toys from meals past in “plastic toy amnesty bins” at Burger King locations to be melted down and recycled into things that are actually useful, like play areas and surface tools, which can be recycled many times over.

People in the U.K. who bring in toys to melt down next week will get a free King Junior meal when they buy any adult meal. To promote the project, Burger King has created a cast of melted-down plastic toy characters, including Beep Beep, a jeep-driving bunny, which the brand has installed a giant melting version of on London’s South Bank to promote the project.

Burger King global CMO Fernando Machado said in a statement that this is the company’s first step in its wider commitment to reduce plastics. “Work is currently underway across all of our markets to look at how we can completely move away from non bio-degradable plastic toys by 2023,” he said.

The melted-down plastic toys will be repurposed by circular economy firm Pentatonic, whose CEO calls Burger King’s move a major leap. “Burger King is not making a vague gesture, which is so often the case in this sector. Instead it is taking significant action,” said Jamie Hall in a statement. “Burger King has listened to its audience and is responding in an emphatic way and we are delighted to provide the design and manufacturing technologies to make their bold vision a reality.”",United States,2019.09
312,How New-Model Cities Are Attracting CRE Investment,"Global cities that adapt to new economic models focusing on quality of life, innovation, sustainability, governance and resilience are becoming new sources of real estate demand and attracting higher cross-border investment, according to a new report from JLL and The Business of Cities, a London-based intelligence and strategy firm.

Issues like technological disruption, concerns over climate change and geopolitical tensions are also changing what businesses need from cities, Jeremy Kelly, director, global research at JLL, said in a prepared statement about the 21-page report, “Demand & Disruption in Global Cities 2019.”

READ ALSO: Coworking to Overtake Tech as Office Leasing Driver

The report describes four new economic models—innovation economy, experience economy, sharing economy and circular economy—and notes they are having a strong impact on global cities, including four that have joined the global leader board—Berlin, Munich, Boston and Stockholm. The innovation economy demands locations become more flexible in use of space and also renews focus on central business districts as venues for increased collaboration. The experience economy thrives on customized experiences and services, while offering a mix of activities. The sharing economy promotes new living and working patterns like coworking and co-living and raises demands for spaces that can be reconfigured. The circular economy emphasizes operational efficiencies and resilience in buildings.

Six of the seven cities that have topped JLL and The Business of Cities’ Established World Cities list since 2013—London, New York, Paris, Singapore, Tokyo and Hong Kong—continue to maintain their stronghold. Seoul is also on the list. Dubbed “The Big Seven,” they are followed closely by “The Global Contenders”—San Francisco, Los Angeles, Shanghai, Toronto, Chicago, Beijing, Amsterdam, Sydney, Madrid and Washington, D.C.

Together they are the top 20 in “The Order of Established Cities” but the report uses more than 500 benchmarks to track cities’ ability to attract businesses and investments, build their jobs base, improve their infrastructure platforms and sustain their growth over the long term. The authors noted the benchmarks, up from about 300 in the 2017 report, produced more in-depth data that also looks at quality of life, urban vibrancy, resilience, economic inclusion and social cohesion, as well as prospects for long-term economic competitiveness. Noting that corporate occupiers and investors are making decisions based on a much broader set of factors than in the past, the report shows a correlation between cities’ all-around competitiveness and their ability to attract cross-border real estate investment.

Despite some challenges like increasing risks from Brexit and a recent slowdown in momentum, London still leads all the global cities. The report notes that London continues to record excellent performance because of its diversification into fintech, robotics, medtech and retailtech, as well as its ongoing cycle of infrastructure investment and redevelopment. Paris, number 3 on the list, continues to benefit from innovation, especially in terms of talent and the business climate, and is also beginning to be a leader in circular economy adoption.

The four cities that are part of the “second division” of “The Global Contenders” have seen their all-around performance improve in the global benchmarks and they are successfully competing on the global stage due to quality of life advantages, innovation capabilities or institutional strength. For example, Munich is in the top 10 because of its transportation system, reputation, student appeal and its increase in investments across assets.

“It is interesting to see that all the new global contenders are medium-sized cities which have developed strengths in the innovation economy. Despite their smaller populations, they are now stepping up and competing on a global stage. These cities are successfully embracing the new economic models to attract capital, corporates and talent,” Kelly told Commercial Property Executive.

While “The Big Seven” and “The Global Contenders” are at the core of the top global cities, the report also breaks down the cities into several other categories, including “New World Cities” and “Emerging World Cities” as well as “Hybrids” and “Natural Growth Engines.” The report states the hybrids—Santiago, Cape Town, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Warsaw, Prague, Budapest and Bucharest—are all medium-sized cities that have attributes of both “Emerging” and “New World Cities.” They compete in specialized markets and have a superior livability compared to regional and national peers. But their labor force and customer appeal are more like those of “Emerging World Cities.”

“National Growth Engines” are cities that are in stable, developed national economies that have large domestic markets, have few competitors and are often built around services or supply functions. Cities that fall into this category are Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, Osaka, Nagoya and Buenos Aires.

New additions to the “New World Cities” list this year are Manchester, Stuttgart, Lisbon, Montreal and Philadelphia. The report points to several “Emerging World Cities” as locations to watch and they include Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Taipei, Istanbul and Moscow.",United States,2019.09
313,Is UK fashion suffering from Brexiety?,"September is a big month in the fashion calendar, with fashion weeks happening in New York, London, Milan and Paris. Each city hosts a series of events over five days where top designers show off their new collections.

Last week was London's turn. Think lots of ""out there"" outfits, air kisses on cheeks and greetings of ""babe, you look incredible!""

But this year, the normal small talk between shows, and at after-parties, was punctuated by discussions about - yep, you guessed it - Brexit.

Everyone from designers to models and garment-makers were keen to know the impact leaving the European Union will have on their industry, which is worth £32bn to the UK's economy.

Despite fears about the possible impact of Brexit, London Fashion Week continues to attract the finest fashion talent from around the globe with designers from more than 19 countries showcasing their designs.

""The UK's fashion scene is still open and inclusive,"" says Paul Yuille, Director of International and Recruitment at London College of Fashion, UAL.

The college, which has produced famous brands like Jimmy Choo and J W Anderson, had three designers in this year's event.

""We've had an increase in applications from European students wanting to study fashion in the UK. It started after the 2016 referendum and this year has been no different.""

But his positive outlook is not shared by everyone in his industry.

Henry Holland is the founder of House of Holland, a designer label worn by celebrities like Kylie Jenner, Lizzo and Little Mix.

His London Fashion Week show on Saturday featured multi-coloured, leopard print dresses, slogan T-shirts and sparkly make-up.

When we meet him in his east London studio - an open space where Henry's dog, Little Miss Peggy, roams free - he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat the uncertainty over a no-deal Brexit is making things difficult for his business.

He says with so much unknown, it's hard to plan ahead.

""I'm petrified about the future. I think people are anxious and cautious, so when your business is reliant on people spending money on clothes - anxiety and caution don't really work for growth.""

On the prospect of overseas trade deals outside the EU with countries like Australia, the US and Canada, he was cautious and acknowledged that any benefits would take time to have effect.

""Yes, there are possibilities there, but that's not something we can do overnight.""

Henry explained how exchange rates are causing him difficulties because of how fashion companies work.

In his industry, it's common for brands to forward sell. Essentially, they agree to sell clothes at a certain price a few months in advance.

But, he says it's hard to know how to price things because of the changing value of the pound.

""The clothes we showcase at fashion week will be on sale to the customers in February next year, so I have to place orders on those goods, this side of Christmas and this side of Brexit. With fluctuating rates it's a total gamble.""

Brexit uncertainty isn't just impacting high end designers, but the high street too.

Jenny Holloway runs Fashion Enter, a clothing factory which makes 10,000 pieces every week for brands including ASOS and Marks and Spencer.

Although they're based in north London, 85% of their machinists are from eastern Europe.

Jenny says they're now struggling to recruit new staff.

""People aren't knocking on the door like they were before, asking if they can come and join us.

""It's been disorientating and frustrating for the workforce because they don't really understand how it will affect them.""

When asked why she doesn't employ more Brits, Jenny says there aren't currently enough qualified people:

""We don't have British garment makers in the numbers we need. There's been a drop in the number since the 70s and 80s"".
• UK fashion, footwear and textile exports reached a record high of £11.5bn in 2018
• It is estimated that only 1% of our clothing is recycled into new garments

But Jenny's determined to bridge the gap, she tells Newsbeat she's set up an apprenticeship course that teaches stitching skills to over-16s. She hopes these trainees will one day become employees.

""Why not make more clothes in the UK?"" she says.

""We have a fashion academy next door and we're teaching fabric skills to young and long-term unemployed people, so we're hoping to have a circular economy.""

The circular economy is an alternative economic system aimed at reducing waste and using as few resources as possible.

Although she's struggling with recruitment, Jenny's optimistic Brexit could push more clothing factories to open in the UK.

Since the 2016 referendum, she says she's had an increase in enquiries from brands interested in making products at her factory. She believes leaving the EU will lead to Britain offering more competitive prices.

""I'm confident that there will be growth within garment manufacturing and more garment manufacturers will pop up.""

But what about the price of clothes? When it comes to the high street, Jenny says costs could go up because of taxes on imports and exports.

""I think if you're importing, and there's going to be delays and transport issues, logistics and who knows about tariffs, I can see prices going up.""

Now the people who look after the industry are getting involved.

The British Fashion Council (BFC) represents designers as well as planning London Fashion Week. It's asking the government to guarantee a deal that makes it easy for European models, machinists and fabrics to come in and out of the UK after Brexit.

In a showroom filled with gem-covered helmets, kitten-heel trainers and chain metal blazers, Caroline Rush - head of the BFC - tells Newsbeat about the benefits she believes EU membership brings to the industry.

""The ease of trading within the EU can't be underestimated, you don't need paperwork, we can travel easily, there are VAT arrangements. There's one body as opposed to negotiating with 27 different territories.""

The government doesn't want designers to panic and says it will ""keep doing everything it can to support the UK's fashion industry"".

Secretary of State for International Trade Liz Truss says ""our designers, artists and creatives are the very best in the world and their success is part of what makes Britain great"".

317,Circular Exuberance in Minneapolis,"This piece was originally published in the September/October 2019 issue of electroindustry.

Young, smart, enterprising, committed, “Woke!”—these descriptors come to mind when I recall the crowd that surrounded me at Circularity 19, which took place in June in Minneapolis. Billed as the “largest circularity event in North America,” this three-day conference was all about what the organizers and attendees are promoting as the 21st-century model for conducting business on the global level—namely, the circular economy (CE).

Readers of these pages will be familiar with the CE concept and also know that a NEMA 2019 Strategic Initiative is aimed at assessing the potential value proposition of circularity for manufacturers of electrical products and systems.

In a nutshell, a circular economy seeks to move beyond the traditional “take, make, dispose” approach that characterizes most economic systems. Instead, the aim becomes buying less and reusing more—keeping products, components, and materials at their highest utility and value at all times.

While the core principles underlying circularity may not be new, the macro-level aspirations of circular economy adherents are hard to overstate. The GreenBiz Group (which presented the conference) predicts the CE will be “transformational, disruptive, regenerative and will create opportunities at every part of the economic spectrum”—with the potential to unlock a $4.5 trillion economic opportunity.

Underlying the CE movement is a communal consensus that climate change is real, is existentially threatening, and can only be rectified through drastic action. References to the impending “climate crisis” are not uncommon among circularity fans, with the circular economy put forth as a necessary part of the solution.

That would explain the level of passionate engagement on display throughout the conference in Minneapolis, which registered more than 800 thought leaders and practitioners in the CE space. The goal of the event was to spread awareness about the circular economy and address myths and misperceptions about how to finance it, the impact on the policy environment, and the value proposition that circularity represents to companies and cities.

If the CE advocates are correct, the payoff from widespread integration of circular principles is a better economy, one that produces fairer, environmentally preferable outcomes while generating profits and conserving resources across the globe. Industry buy-in is crucial, with manufacturing playing a lead role.

I attended Circularity 19 with an open mind and a desire to find out which elements of circular thinking make sense for electrical products and systems—and which do not. It’s not a simple determination, given the enormous diversity of our industry and the somewhat revolutionary vision of CE advocates. Simply put, NEMA Member companies will embrace circularity if it provides a competitive edge, increases their bottom line, and requires no compromise to product safety and performance. They will also do so if regulation forces the issue, but it’s always preferable for industry to find its own innovative path in response to societal trends and priorities.

First, there is ample evidence that markets will reward companies that openly emphasize circularity in their business model and investment strategy. It likely will involve a staged process guided by nontraditional notions about the nature of products and relationships with customers, but the potential returns could be substantial.

Second, it’s vital that companies identify where circularity makes the most sense in their product scope and concentrate efforts there. Remanufacturing, for example, was touted at the conference as an extraordinarily high-return venture but is not a viable option for many products. Perhaps the value proposition lies instead in circular supply chains or seeking out next-generation packaging materials.

Truly circular thinking is rapidly expanding the boundaries of what it means to be sustainable. “Cradle to grave” thinking, for instance, has been displaced by “cradle to cradle,” and designers are now advised to design products for their initial use and future uses, as opposed to end of life.

Finally, I’m convinced that large-scale integration of circular principles will require a major “system shift” in some companies, and change like this can be driven only from the top. A rising tide of talented young engineers, designers, planners, MBAs, and “corporate strategists” is ready to provide the brainpower and enthusiasm, but the fundamental transformation they seek must be blessed and promoted by the C-suite. If that happens, circularity may very well move beyond incremental tweaks to a revolution that upends products, services, and systems of commerce.

NEMA Members who attend the 2019 Annual Meeting in Naples, Florida, are encouraged to participate in the Circular Economy Workshop on Wednesday, Nov. 6. NEMA staff and outside experts will present the findings of the ongoing Strategic Initiative and discuss the implications of circularity for the electro-product industry.

318,Aquaponic farming: Harnessing natural processes for an urban circular economy,"The word ""waste"" describes materials or products that are no longer of use. In a linear economy, it accumulates as an undesired by-product of economic activity. Waste and environmental hazards are commonplace throughout the current industrialized food system. Although some initiatives have been aiming to reduce waste toward the end stage—for example, by changing consumer perceptions and matching excess supply with demand—significant progress needs to be made during food production. Where do we start?

One idea that has been growing in both research and practice is the circular economy, which sees value in ""waste"" flows and re-routes them back into the economic process. A striking example of a circular-economy business model in action is aquaponics, which combines elements of aquaculture (fish farming) and hydroponics (plant farming with controlled systems). It allows a single producer to sustainably grow produce and raise fish within the local community.

While traditional aquaculture is performed in structures within a natural environment, aquaponics adopts the circular-symbiosis approach, where the biological waste of a fish farm is harmonised to be the biological food for the production of plants such as herbs, salads and tomatoes. Compared to traditional industrial farming operations, where circularity might be added at the end (for example, compost), aquaponics employs a circular production design by leveraging nature's template. This is a balancing act to technologically control two separate but dependent biological systems, which improves the productivity of the physical space—in this case an urban environment—while reducing environmental impacts.

Aquaponic firms leading the way include ECF Farmsystems and Stadtfarm in Berlin, BIGH Farm in Anderlecht, Urban Smart Farm in Gent and Bioaqua Farm in Blackford, United Kingdom. They're among a growing number of urban-farming pioneers that challenge the way we perceive, produce, and purchase our food.

How these benefits are derived can best be understood by a comparison with traditional aquaculture systems. In these cases, fish produces high levels of nitrates and phosphorus, which must be purged from the system and replaced with fresh water to maintain healthy living conditions. However, by flushing this nutrient-rich fish wastewater into the environment, ecosystems may be damaged by eutrophication. In urban environments, it imposes costs for treatment through municipal sewage systems. Furthermore, these same nutrients are required for plant cultivation—and in the case of nitrates—they are commonly derived in an industrial process that requires significant quantities of methane gas, must be shipped to the farm, and are often (over)applied to crops.

An aquaponics system takes the would-be waste output of highly nutrient water and delivers it directly to plants, cleaning it and reducing this dependence on added fertilizer. The water is maintained in the system, continuously circulates and is cleaned mechanically and biologically. It effectively reduces water needs – advanced aquaponics systems achieve up to 90% higher water efficiency than traditional field farming—as well as reducing the dependency on fossil fuel for transportation, because production is close to the markets for the final food products.

""Food miles"" are not only a contributor to GHG-emissions but they are also part of a phenomenon of anonymization of food production, detaching the consumer from its source. Sustainable urban farming through aquaponics thus brings food production closer to its consumers. While urban farming is primarily a source of plant-based fiber, vitamins and minerals, aquaponics is able to deliver the missing dietary link, animal protein. Indeed, aquaculture is far more efficient and practical in this respect than other forms of livestock breeding in urban environments. Furthermore, it has the added social benefit of bringing advanced farming jobs to urban areas.

Thus far, aquaponics businesses operate in a vague policy environment that falls under both aquaculture and agriculture, resulting in a web of bureaucracy. At the EU level, aquaponics is not regulated as a distinct sector, and regulations are therefore less than ideal. This filters down to the local level, where major challenges faced by aquaponic operations concerning zoning, planning and permissioning. Surprisingly, ECF had struggled to have its greenhouses approved on what is currently an industrial sector—there are rigid definitions of what industry, agriculture and food production are, limiting the integration of such innovative concepts.

Furthermore, to assess the sustainability of any process, one must consider all inputs and outputs. For aquaponics, while there is potential for significant environmental benefits, a major challenge is obtaining sustainable fish feed. Most is derived from soy or animal products with significant environmental impacts themselves. Furthermore, some feed components aren't ones that the fish species would find in its natural environment and thus aren't needed. Developments in insect-based feedstock might be a solution to many environmental concerns.

Despite these challenges, ECF and other aquaponics advocates, believing in substantial benefits for society, continue to expand and seek out regulatory changes, signaling hope for the new market.

The concept of aquaponics provides insights into how circularity could be approached and ease the challenges of global population growth—with a need for sustainable food, free of herbicides, pesticides, hormon … s, and microplastics, that considers urbanization, food transportation, clean water scarcity, and environmental hazards related to traditional farming, eutrophication and carbon emissions in particular. Beyond these benefits, urban farming may also help green our concrete jungles and have further environmental and psychological benefits.

319,"Fab City, the global circular economy movement centered around local makers | Greenbiz","Asia Tamaoki, 18, admits he doesn’t know much about Fab City, an initiative challenging cities around the world to produce everything they consume by 2054. Tamaoki, a physics student at the College of Alameda in Oakland, California, has other things to focus on, such as doing his homework, getting good grades and being accepted into a four-year university. However, despite his unfamiliarity with Fab City’s larger efforts, Tamaoki is very much a part of them.

In December, while he was casually looking for a part-time job, Tamaoki stumbled across a posting by the college’s Fab Lab to be a maker-in-residence. The position sounded intriguing, and Tamaoki was hired. Since January, he’s learned how to operate high-tech machinery, expensive tools and cutting-edge computer programs.

""This is the coolest place,"" Tamaoki said. ""I’m learning all the time, and without the Fab Lab, I wouldn’t have the chance to access this stuff.""

Fab City is about surfacing known inventions that haven’t been sufficiently exploited and connecting people to put those ideas into practice at the community level. As the idea of Fab Labs and Fab City continues to gain traction on a global scale, what’s emerging aren’t ground-breaking technologies, fix-all machines and earth-shattering inventions. Rather, Fab City’s organizers are striving to build an international platform that invites makers, planners, thinkers, designers, students — everyone — to the table to share place-based best practices regarding urban design, workforce development, manufacturing, food production and more.

Given that humans have spent over 200 years developing global industry, Fab City understands that societal shifts won't happen overnight; however, by empowering global citizens to make local changes, Fab City is connecting people around the world to transform the cities of today into the circular cities of tomorrow.

Tomás Díez, director and co-founder at Fab Lab Barcelona, helped launch Fab City in 2014. According to him, it was an aspirational ""weekend project"" that quickly grew into a much bigger reality.

Fab City was set in motion more than 10 years before it officially launched, when the first ""fabrication laboratory,"" or Fab Lab, was created by MIT in 2001. MIT’s Fab Lab became a place where students could learn to design and make, as it was pitched to students, ""almost anything"" using digital means. The concept took off, and an open-source network of makerspaces spread across the globe, doubling in size about every 18 months. As of 2018, there were over 1,300 Fab Labs worldwide, in places such as university campuses, developing countries, trade schools, disaster sites, traveling buses and the College of Alameda, where Tamaoki gets to play with cool tools as part of his work-study program.

In 2014, the City Council of Barcelona, Spain, pushed Fab Labs to new heights. With support from the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia, MIT and Fab Lab Barcelona, the city’s mayor made a commitment (PDF) to have Barcelona produce everything it consumes within 40 years. Organizers, including Díez, called it Fab City, and other cities were invited to make the 2054 pledge to transform their cities into fully circular economies. Today, with about 34 years left to shift away from the industrial, product-in, trash-out paradigm that we live in, 34 cities, countries and regions are signed onto the global Fab City initiative.

From the very beginning, one of Fab City’s biggest challenges has been its rapid growth. According to Díez, Fab City’s organizers didn’t anticipate other cities to follow Barcelona’s lead so quickly. ""The growth has surprised us, and our challenge has been to make it grow sustainably and to make it grow in a distributed, [team-oriented] way,"" he said.

Therefore, Fab City relies on seemingly basic technology tools such as email and instant messaging, as well as in-person events, to bring people from across the movement together to coordinate larger initiatives, exchange experience-based best practices, share methodologies and find better ways to live in cities without compromising the future of the planet.

Although Fab City hosts a number of small, targeted events throughout the year in cities around the world, Fab City’s biggest event is its annual summit. In 2019, the summit was hosted in Amsterdam, and over the next three years, it’ll be held in Montreal, Canada; Seoul, South Korea; and Mérida, Mexico, respectively.

Besides its quick growth, Fab City’s other major challenge is that it’s not technically a formalized organization — it’s an organized movement. However, that’s about to change.

Within the next couple of months, the Fab City Foundation officially will launch, thus making Fab City a fully operational organization that’s able to funnel private funding and public dollars (primarily from the European Union) into supporting a number of local projects. The foundation will be based in Estonia, and its main office will be in Barcelona.

The growth has surprised us, and our challenge has been to make it grow sustainably and to make it grow in a distributed, [team-oriented] way. ""The foundation will help us to develop stronger Fab City consortiums in each one of our cities so we can work more consistently on deploying agenda-related actions,"" Díez said. ""Funding is needed in order to make that happen, so the foundation will be able to channel funds coming from organizations like the United Nations and World Bank to support cities at the local level.""

When asked to highlight an exciting invention or an innovative best practice ""at the local level"" that’s emerged out of the global Fab City movement, Díez stressed that Fab City isn’t about ""moon shots,"" as he calls them: it’s about building a platform. Therefore, rather than pursuing quick-fix solutions that he sees as feeding into society’s need for instant gratification, Díez says Fab City is more about surfacing known inventions that haven’t been sufficiently exploited and connecting people to put those ideas into practice at the community level.

One community actively involved in Fab City’s larger efforts is Oakland, California.

Oakland Fab City’s programs are coordinated by Elevator Works, a micro-manufacturing hub in West Oakland started by Sal Bednarz and Danny Beesley, who together have decades of experience working within Oakland’s small business, Fab Lab, green building and education scenes.

For years, the two wanted to explore how they could close the gap between local education and regional entrepreneurs, manufacturing, innovation and jobs. After a series of meetings with Fab City leaders, the two decided Fab City had the potential to ""knit these things together,"" as Bednarz phrased it. In July 2018, the two makers pitched Fab City to Oakland Mayor Libby Shaaf, and she signed the pledge, thus plugging the East Bay into Fab City’s larger global coalition.

Soon after Shaaf signed the pledge, Bednarz flew to Paris to represent Oakland at Fab City’s 2018 annual summit. He was expecting a conference centered around technological advances and new machinery; however, that wasn’t his experience.

""What I saw at the Fab City conference was a lot of projects that were really prototyping an idea that was relevant to the local community around a Fab Lab,"" Bednarz said. ""The Fab Lab was just a platform on which those conversations could happen. It wasn't a technology story. It was a people story.""

Bednarz and Beesley returned to the East Bay with a new level of clarity of how they wanted to grow Fab City in Oakland: They wanted to include everyone. Over the past year, Oakland Fab City has cast a wide net aimed at capturing the city’s history of social justice, inclusivity and innovation, and Oakland Fab City organizers are working with everyone from formerly incarcerated youth to business associations to college students to architecture firms to start a conversation about what Oakland 2054 looks like.

""I like to say this to people,"" Bednarz said. ""It’s 2054, we built a different city, we achieved our goal: tell me what you did to help us get there.""

Bednarz isn’t looking for silver bullets, and similar to Díez’s comments about moon shots, Oakland Fab City isn’t trying to solve today’s major challenges tomorrow. Instead, Bednarz and Beesley want to build momentum by attracting investors, forging public-private partnerships and creating community.

""The unique thing about the Fab City initiative is it's an idea that invites everybody to the table,"" Beesley said. ""It’s a catch-all. When we talk to educators about Fab Labs and maker spaces, everyone agrees they’re valuable. Fab City fits right into that. If we’re talking about sustainability or climate change or producing things locally, Fab City is a core solution that can involve everybody.""

2054 is far in the future for Asia Tamaoki, the 18-year-old College of Alameda student. However, knowingly or not, Tamaoki is helping to push Oakland Fab City toward its 2054 goal each and every time he steps into the Fab Lab. That’s because he’s doing his part to bring more people into the larger conversation. In the past nine months, Tamaoki has welcomed his entire family and many of his friends into the College of Alameda’s Fab Lab so they can see the machines, the makerspace and the community for themselves.

""Part of it is finding this awesome thing and wanting to share it with people,"" Tamaoki said. ""The more people that come in the better.""",United States,2019.09
320,‘Circular economy’ startup Truman’s raises $5 million from Germany’s Henkel.,"The six-month old green cleaning product startup raised the seed funds in a round led by Henkel Ventures, the investment arm of the German consumer products conglomerate.

321,Growth Opportunities in the Circular Economy for Global Electric Vehicle Battery Reuse (Second-life) and Recycling Market - Global Forecast to 2025,"DUBLIN, Sept. 18, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- The ""Growth Opportunities in the Circular Economy for Global Electric Vehicle Battery Reuse (Second-life) and Recycling Market, Forecast to 2025"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global electric vehicle reuse and recycling market stands at $61.5 million as of 2018 and is expected to reach $7809.1 million by 2025, recording a CAGR of 99.8%.

The reuse segment is currently in full swing in terms of revenue; however, over the years, recycling of EV batteries is going to gain traction. With escalating metal prices especially cobalt and impending new legislative drivers such as the dedicated EU Directive for electric vehicle batteries recycling, the recycling market is expected to kick start with exponential growth from 2021 onwards.

The electric vehicle market reached over 1.6 million sales in 2018 with more than 165 models available for sale. Close to 20 million electric vehicles are expected to be sold across the world by 2025, recording a CAGR of 41.7%. China is leading the market with 51% market share, followed by Europe with 26%, North America with 19%, and Japan with 4%. 



Increasing oil prices, demand for urban vehicles, mega cities, and focus on sustainable transportation has kick-started a substantial trend towards automotive electrification such as hybrids and electric vehicles. Over 2.9 million electric vehicles are likely to be sold globally in 2019 of which 59% will be battery electric vehicles (BEV's) and 41% will be plug-in hybrids, recording a y-o-y market growth of 78.1%.

The global electric vehicle battery reuse (second life) segment generated revenue of $51.24 million in 2018 and is expected to reach $1,284.91 million by 2025, recording a CAGR of 58.5%. Currently, automobile companies are reusing and reassembling end-of-life electric vehicle battery packs and offering them as lower-cost replacement batteries for older electric cars. Residential and commercial customers also use them in combination with on-site solar power for backup supply. 



For example, the batteries from lower-range electric vehicles, such as the Chevy Volt and Cadillac ELR, could provide half a day worth of household electricity usage, while batteries from higher-range electric vehicles, such as the Mercedes SLS and the Tesla Model S, could provide a few days of household electricity usage. Several major power utilities are working with companies including General Motors, Ford, Toyota, and Nissan to explore use of the batteries for stationary storage of the power produced in off-peak periods by wind turbines and solar generation stations. 



Lithium-ion packs also are being tested as backup power storage systems for retail centers, restaurants, and hospitals, as well as for residential solar systems. EVgo has announced its plan of utilizing second-life batteries to its grid-tied public fast-charging systems. The packs have been wired up through a 30kW inverter that allows the packs to add significant value to a charging session by avoiding demand charges that might otherwise be incurred.

The global electric vehicle battery recycling market, on the other hand, generated 2018 revenue of $10.26 million and is expected to reach $6,524.20 million by 2025, recording a CAGR of 151.5%. Out of the revenue generated, hydro-metallurgical process constituted 59%, followed by pyro-metallurgical process at 39% and other recycling technologies at 2%. In the pyro-metallurgical process, various components of battery cells are liquefied using high temperatures that enable recovery of transition metals nickel, cobalt, and copper, while lithium and aluminum remain in the slag. The hydro-metallurgy process uses an in-solution chemistry to isolate component chemical compounds from battery waste. 



It is considered appropriate for the recovery of 18 metals from LIBS, due to good purity, low energy requirements, and minimal air emissions. Mechanical methods are generally recognized to be an effective pre-treatment to deal with spent LIBs; these methods include sieving, crushing, magnetic separation, and so on. Belgian-based Umicore, a leading supplier of key materials for rechargeable batteries, uses a combination of pyro- and hydro-metallurgical processes to recycle all types and sizes of batteries. The company has the facility to recycle about 35,000 electric vehicle batteries per year. The process is mainly designed to recover nickel, cobalt, and copper as an alloy, which is further processed by hydro-metallurgical methods.

Second use of electric vehicle batteries is often seen as an opportunity to delay disposal and recycling, which currently presents burdens for OEMs, as well as an opportunity to squeeze value out of existing resources. Sumitomo has established the world's first large-scale power storage system in Osaka exclusively utilizing EOL Nissan Leaf batteries repurposed by 4R Energy.

Recycling presents an opportunity for the system owner to increase profit margins and decrease its footprint, in addition to providing benefits to other stakeholders. To facilitate recycling, new energy car battery producers are focusing on adopting standardized and easy-to-dismantle designs and sharing information about battery controlling systems' interfaces and communication protocols.

Collaborative partnerships between public and private entities will be a paramount strategy for effective advanced vehicle battery recycling. Vertical integration along the value chain presents an opportunity for system owners to increase profit margins and decrease their footprint, in addition to providing benefits to other stakeholders. The BMW Group, Northvolt, and Umicore have formed a joint technology consortium in order to work closely together on the continued development of a complete and sustainable value chain for battery cells for electrified vehicles in Europe.

Innovative business models like the Tesla-Umicore partnership create arrangements that are as good for the company as they are for the community, and show how a recycling system can be both profitable and environmentally sound. Supportive regulations that focus on recycling Li-ion batteries will alleviate material scarcity, lower costs of the materials, and avoid production impacts, including the reduction of energy use, emissions, and mining impacts. Solid investment in the collection and recycling infrastructure and technology for new generation vehicle batteries, along with effective regulation, will promote higher collection and recycling rates for Li-ion batteries.

Battery lifecycle management is a huge emerging opportunity that could solve the issue of how to stop electric vehicle batteries ending up as expensive and toxic landfill waste. Enabling new business models, such as storage on-demand and storage as a service, would allow emerging energy companies to generate new revenue streams without spending on asset building.

324,Yerdle aims to become the platform for the circular economy | WARC,"Apparel resale is big business – estimated to be worth $51 billion by 2023 in the US alone – and platform company Yerdle is positioning itself as a way for brands to deepen customer engagement via this channel while adding environmental credentials.

Co-founded by former Walmart chief sustainability officer Andy Reuben in 2012, the company is now promoting strategies through which manufacturers can find new value beyond the first sale and move into the circular economy by re-selling used items.

According to some estimates, as many as 33% of Generations Y and Z have used some kind of resale purchase or rental in the last year, and participation is estimated to be growing by around 40% year-on-year. Reuben argues that the consumer interest is there, but it has taken time to find the right formula.

“When we started Yerdle, we worked on a marketplace where people could exchange used items. And what we learned was that the friction in doing so was just too high – posting something, finding the item, trusting the seller of the item”, Reuben told McKinsey. Though brands liked the concept, they were reluctant to see their items next to very worn items.

Two years ago, this insight led the startup to pivot towards brands “so that alongside the items they have always made and sold, they can buy back items that customers no longer need, and then resell them.”

Now the platform is powering segments of its partners’ retail offerings. For instance, the outerwear company Patagonia uses Yerdle to run its Worn Wear hub, an e-commerce component of the company that allows customers to browse and buy used items that people have traded in for store credit. Though the hub appears under the aegis of the Patagonia brand, Yerdle takes care of the logistics, tech, and program management.

Despite widely reported forecasts – admittedly commissioned by the resale company thredUP, and compiled by the retail analytics firm GlobalData – that the US second-hand market is set to double in the next five years, brands still have doubts. After all, by promoting pre-owned items, why would customers buy new?

“It is a massive market shift whether or not brands and retailers take part. And when a brand is dealing with a disruption that is inherently a shift in how customers buy and what they buy, the choice of sitting this out is to walk away from the customer”, Reuben says. “I don’t know why a brand would do that.”

He maintains that the platform’s real influence is in strengthening relationships with customers, especially with schemes similar to Patagonia’s, in which traded-in clothes are bought back with in-store credit. Offering a gift card to bring back a jacket, he says, is re-engagement that builds loyalty.

“When that jacket then gets sold to a new customer who aspires to the brand, we typically see a marketing return twice as good as a brand benchmark, because you’ve got an item to work with right now that appeals to a group of people who aspire to the brand.”",United States,2019.09
325,CA Legislature Fails to Act On Ambitious Plastics and Circular Economy Bills,"SACRAMENTO, Sept 16, 2019 — In the final week of session, the California Legislature failed to pass legislation aimed at reducing and recycling single use products and packaging.

Senate Bill 54 (Allen, Skinner, Stern, Wiener) and Assembly Bill 1080 (Gonzalez, Calderon, Friedman, Ting), companion measures known jointly as the California Circular Economy and Pollution Reduction Act, would have required manufacturers and producers to reduce product and packaging waste by 75% by 2030 through source reduction, recycling, and composting.

Despite tremendous support from the public and over 140+ organizations, including leading environmental, public health, labor, local government, waste hauler, faith-based, and business groups, the measures faced significant opposition from the plastics industry and packaging manufacturers. Without assurance of 21 votes in the State Senate and 41 votes in the Assembly, the bills were held over by the authors for consideration when the legislature returns in January.

“This plastic pollution crisis is too pressing to put off for another year, so it’s really disappointing that the opposition’s disingenuous hyperbole was able to sway the legislature,” said Nick Lapis, Director of Advocacy of Californians Against Waste. “I think the public response to these bills has sent a strong signal that Californians want their legislators to take decisive action to turn the tide on plastic pollution.”

The measures were subject to intense and deceptive lobbying tactics by plastic packaging manufacturers and the California Manufacturers and Technology Association (CMTA). Novolex, one of the nation’s largest manufacturers plastic bags and grocery sector packaging, created and funded the misleadingly named “Californians for Recycling and the Environment” which funded a deceptive social media campaign targeting members of the California legislature.

Similarly, CMTA distributed an anonymous Floor Alert to members of the legislature that appeared to convey support for non-controversial recycling related measures for which CMTA had no interest or position, while expressing opposition to SB 54/AB1080.

“It’s telling that Plastics and Packaging Interests felt it necessary to deceive members of the legislature and disguise the source of lobbying efforts and resources in an effort to defeat California’s bold plastic pollution legislation,” said Mark Murray, Executive Director of Californians Against Waste.

The bills also enjoyed engagement from celebrities who chimed in on social media for a final push on Friday, including Jason Momoa, Jeff Goldblum, Kelly Slater, Jeff Bridges, and Alicia Silverstone.

These high-profile environmental bills will be eligible for a vote next year in January when the Legislature reconvenes for the second half of the 2019-2020 legislative sessions.

A number of other recycling related bills did pass the Legislature in the final week and now sit on the governor’s desk awaiting a signature. These include:
• AB 792 (Ting) – Mandates manufacturers to use recycled content in plastic beverage containers, starting with 10% by 2021 and scaling up to 50% by 2030. These standards are the most ambitious in the world, surpassing the European Union’s mandates for recycled content maxing out at 30% by 2028.
• AB 1583 (Eggman) – The California Recycling Market Development Act creates a “Statewide Commission on Recycling Markets and Curbside Recycling” to oversee statewide messaging on recyclability product redesign. The bill also reauthorized the Recycling Market Development Zone (RMDZ) loan program and the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority (CAEATFA), which provided sales tax exemptions for recycling and remanufacturing equipment. AB 1583 also eliminated an existing requirement to for all plastic products to have the “chasing arrows” symbol,
• AB 827 (McCarty) – Requires businesses to make composting and recycling bins accessible to customers wherever they have trash bin.
• AB 614 (Eggman) – Expands the Farm to Food Bank tax credit beyond fresh produce to include other staples such as rice, beans, eggs, nuts, and other goods.
• AB 1162 (Kalra) – Prohibits the distribution of single-use toiletries at lodging establishments.
• AB 619 (Chiu) – Allows customers to bring their own reusable foodservice items to restaurants and temporary food facilities.
• AB 187 (C. Garcia) – Updates the Used Mattress Recycling Act to increase consumer access to convenient recycling for used mattresses, including expanding free mattress pickup for consumers that purchases mattress online.
• AB 729 (Chu) – Revises the Carpet Recycling Act to ensure that all funds collected pursuant to the program are used to fund recycling.

These remaining 8 bills must be approved by Governor Newsom before October 13th.

327,Turning To A ‘Circular’ Economic Model To Combat The Climate Crisis,"The number of people who have joined their hands, across India, to win the title of the third-largest carbon emission producer globally amounts to 1,369,084,656. In India, around 62 million tonnes of waste are produced every year and only a mere 22% of that is processed- downcycled or upcycled. Also, by 2045 the numbers will reach 450 million tonnes.

It is popularly believed that the re-advent of globalisation and increasingly complex functionalities of capitalism that has pushed the patterns of a consumer all around the world to undergo immense change. Patterns of consumption are part of the problem and are not the sole prerogative for the same. Indian society has witnessed a paradigm shift from the old tradition where the nature of thriftiness—wherein the families, generation-after-generation, not only reused and recycles products, towards a more expansive neo-consumption habit, where ‘generation X and Y,’ characterised by substantially high levels of disposable income in hand, are moving towards compulsive hyper-consumption. What we need to distinguish here is that consumption is not wrong, rather it is a necessity.

Although that being said, unregulated and unprecedented levels often result in bringing forth the unsustainability of man. Consumption constitutes of vital choices, entailing to both lifelines (water, food, clothes, health) and lifestyles (white goods, brand-conscious compulsive shopping, leisure, entertainment) that explicitly and implicitly impact our environment. Further, there is an inequality in consumption patterns, often resulting in a large section of the more vulnerable rungs of society having to directly deal with its aftermath. It is instrumental that the species of human beings— understand that our actions and decisions not only threaten our immediate environment but will also lead to the extinction of other species.

Time and again, humans are sold the idea of how and is a stepping stone to one’s happiness. What many undermine, is one’s individuals ability to not only ensure their own safety and healthy living but also that of the others. To progress towards building a conducive environment for all, across species and biotic-abiotic systems, a solution can be drawn from shifting our economy’s pattern.

India, from a ‘circular’ economy, has made a journey towards becoming a ‘linear’ economy, which has been categorised as the core of the problem. In the past, when a jar of jam would get over, it found a new life within Indian households as a pickle container, or to store pulses, etc. Today, its new home is tucked away from the aesthetically pleasing city boundaries to the suburbs that hold landfills. Land, like other natural resources, are finite in nature. Therefore, judicious use of the same is the key to sustainable development. Despite us seeing no worth in our waste, there is enormous potential to capitalise on it as a resource that is of value. There is a section of the population within India, approximately 1.7 million, whose livelihoods are engaged in value preservation of the waste produced by us.

Now is the time to acknowledge that we live in a world where a global ‘crisis’ and not global ‘change’ is the reality, a world that needs to start to see merit in what impact an individual can have on the world. The planet is under growing pressure, our consumption is only adding to that, which is why we need to do our bit. Is our reluctance perhaps the hypocrisy of the human mind that stops it from achieving its best potential? Are we suffering from the tragedy of the common goods? Or are we the rational human beings pushing the onus on the government and not engaging in a dialogue at the level of the civil society. Whatever it might be, one has to take a call and be the change-maker.

328,AIMPLAS presents innovations in sustainable development at K,"AIMPLAS, the Plastics Technology Centre, will once again have a booth at K Fair where it will display its main technological developments in the circular economy, active and smart packaging, sustainable mobility, medicine and decarbonisation of the economy.

Nearly 70 Spanish exhibiting companies will attend this year, with AIMPLAS having confirmed its participation to exhibit some of its innovations in sustainable development.

On 17 October framed within the show organised by PlasticsEurope, Mapi Diego, a researcher of the Extrusion department of AIMPLAS, will talk about developments in compostable materials for food packaging.

Most of the projects to be presented will focus on the circular economy, including new sorting and treatment systems for waste of different origins.

AIMPLAS will also exhibit its new developments in active and smart packaging designed to keep food fresh and preserve different products such as audiovisual heritage. This new packaging contains sensors, improved barrier properties, additives and absorbents to extend the contents’ shelf life.

The centre will also present projects on decarbonisation of the economy, CO2 capture and storage for subsequent reuse as a raw material, and solutions for electric cars that will lead to progress in sustainable mobility.

In the area of human health and wellbeing, AIMPLAS will present developments in new polymeric materials designed to prevent disease and improve diagnosis and treatment. Because these smart materials have the ability to change state, they can be used for tissue regeneration, oncology, nanomedicine and precision medicine. All these developments are designed to improve health and quality of life.",United States,2019.09
330,From trash to treasure: circular economy brings hope in Vietnam,"HANOI — Trần Thị Bình, 60, who lives in Hà Nội, has no idea about the circular economy but now brings her canvas bag shopping instead of taking plastic bags from the supermarket.

Vũ Lan Anh, 35, from HCM City, likes to use glass juice bottles as flower vases. She is also willing to pay a slightly higher price for a recycled product to protect the environment.

Consciously or unconsciously, these examples show that the application of circular principles and their behaviours present golden opportunities for businesses.

The circular economy, or simply circularity, is a global trend, driven by scarcity of resources. It is an economic system of closed loops in which raw materials, components and products are put in use for longer, thus improving the productivity of resources.

In this concept, all ‘waste’ should become ‘food’ for another production process which is in contrast to the traditional linear production model of ‘take, make, dispose’.

It’s clear that as the global population grows, urban societies will consume more resources per capita, putting more pressure on the planet.

The circular model can stop unnecessary exploitation of resources and this concept is appealing as it not only makes our current way of life more sustainable but also presents opportunities for businesses.

Experts are talking about a US$4.5 trillion opportunity by 2030 and $25 trillion by 2050 that the circular economy can offer (Waste to Wealth by The Accenture Strategy research in 2015).

The world is moving towards a circular economy.

Many companies, in one way or another, are introducing zero-waste goals and are building business strategies to transition to circularity.

Last year, a platform for accelerating the circular economy (PACE) was launched at the World Economic Forum 2018 with the participation of more than 50 government and business leaders. This is a private-public collaboration mechanism which seeks to scale up circular economy innovations. PACE members include global corporations like Coca-Cola, Ikea, Unilver, Philips, Alphabet Inc and HP.

In Việt Nam, the circular economy is a rather new concept. The first movers are big or foreign-invested companies.

According to Patrick Chung, general director of Lee & Man Vietnam, sustainable development is a policy encouraged by the Government but is not mandatory. The implementation depends only on the ability and orientation of the company and dedication of the management board.

“However, it is also difficult for companies to pursue this goal,” Chung told Việt Nam News.

He said to do this, companies must consider many aspects such as finance, resources and vision, and they must invest time, effort and resources into non-financial goals related to environment and society.

“This obviously partly reduces the company’s profit. Without trade-offs, companies cannot pursue a true sustainable development goal.”

There is a fact that it is cheaper to make products using recycled materials.

At Lee & Man – an FDI paper manufacturer – more than 95 per cent of inputs are from recycled materials. Chung said on average, paper can be recycled up to six times before becoming unusable. Therefore, not taking advantage of this ‘resource’ is wasteful and puts more pressure on the environment.

In the paper industry, solid waste such as metal and plastic are processed while recycling paper can be re-supplied to other manufacturing industries, Chung said, giving an example of non-reusable waste that will be incinerated at the factory, the ashes will be purchased by cement companies to produce cement or other companies to produce unburnt bricks.

To follow this model, the company has invested millions of dollars in waste treatment.

Could Vietnamese companies, most of which are micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), afford circularity?

“It’s not necessary to be cost-intensive. The circular economy can be a smart business model,” Constant Van Aerschot, Director Asia Pacific at the World Business Council for Sustainable Development told Việt Nam News.

On the sidelines of the national conference on sustainable development in Hà Nội last week, Aerschot said SMEs can become suppliers to big companies. If SMEs can find a solution that helps big companies become more circular, the circular economy is also an opportunity for them.

“Any circular model that helps big companies is also good for small ones,” he said, noting that leasing or taking back products for reproduction are models that are not very costly and small companies can take advantage of.

Bùi Thị Loan, Sustainability Manager at Heineken Brewery Vietnam, said Heineken had stopped most printing and now lease external printing services.

Loan suggested companies can re-assess the life cycle of their products to find points that can be improved to bring the most value. But this process needs a roadmap and specific goals “because it’s impossible to do all things at the same time”.

Now, most companies are in the early stages of understanding what the circular economy means and thinking about reducing waste or making sure that products are recycled.

Sustainable development has moved to the ideology that is targeted at designing material cycles that can continue running for a very long time and products are designed in such a way that they can be recycled or are made of recycled materials.

Many businesses in Việt Nam have launched campaigns to reduce waste and encourage a green lifestyle. But as a representative of Unilever Vietnam said, they are actions of responsible companies and there should be a private-public partnership mechanism to do it on a larger scale and the Government should take a role here.

Consumers, as well as Vietnamese customers, today pay more attention to the environment. They are even willing to pay more for a product with a positive impact on the environment. This is an opportunity but also a challenge for companies to take action towards sustainable development.

Companies thus have to rapidly find their role in the transition to the circular economy. Don’t let the opportunity go to waste.",United States,2019.09

334,Circular Economy and Pollution Reduction Act Stalls in California Legislature,"The Circular Economy and Pollution Reduction Act, SB-54/AB-1080, did not pass the California State Legislature before the 2019/2020 legislative session ended on September 13, 2019.

The bills would have required all single-use packaging manufactured or sold in California to be recyclable or compostable by 2030 and would have also mandated a 75% reduction of waste generated by single-use packaging and priority single-use products through a combination of source reduction, recycling, or composting. “Priority single-use plastic products” were defined as “single-use food service ware, including plates, bowls, cups, utensils, stirrers, and straws.” In addition, producers of single-use packaging and priority single use plastic products would have been required to register with the California Department of Resources, Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) and report any data that the Department deemed necessary.

The California Legislature will reconvene on January 6, 2020, when both bills may be reconsidered, according to a press release from the American Chemical Council (ACC). Expressing support for the goals of SB-54/AB-1080, ACC encouraged the state legislature to “address key issues such as the need for funding to expand and improve the state’s recycling infrastructure and updating the state’s solid waste laws to ensure that innovative chemical recycling technologies are part of the solution.”

Concerns about the state’s recycling infrastructure were behind the Grocery Manufacturer Association opposition to the bills. In a September 10 editorial in the Orange County Register, GMA President and CEO Geoff Freeman pointed out that since 2013, 50% of California’s redemption centers have closed. He added, “Given the frustration around CalRecycle’s management of the existing recycling programs, regulated entities are likely to find further frustration in operating within a broken system, even under new policies. Sadly, [SB-54/AB-1080] could lead to a path where producers, and ultimately consumers, will be saddled with a $50,000 per day, per violation fine because of CalRecycle’s shortcomings.”

Another bill aimed at reducing plastic waste did, however, pass the state legislature by the September 13 deadline. AB-792 requires beverage containers to contain no less than 10% postconsumer recycled plastic content by 2021, 25% by 2025 and 50% by 2030Governor Gavin Newsom has until October 13 to sign or veto AB-792.",United States,2019.09

336,Circular Economy: Stakeholders call for effective plastic waste management,"As countries across the world sustain the drive towards mitigating the dangers of non-degradable waste, participants at the CEO Roundtable on Sustainability have hinted that Nigeria stands a good chance of bending the curve in good time, only if the private and public sector can collaborate strategically.

Aside policy making, the panel recommended strategic timelines for executing each step of the national plan on circular economy.

The CEO Roundtable on Sustainability is a yearly event organized by the Lagos Business School to generate debate and chart a course for economic development through sustainable initiatives. Partners for this year’s event, themed “Action to Mitigate Plastic Pollution” were Guinness Nigeria Plc and Nestle Nigeria Plc.

Commenting on the impact of plastic waste pollution on businesses and the society, the Managing Director, Guinness Nigeria PLC, Mr. Baker Magunda, in his Convener’s remarks, stated that the focus should be on achieving zero-waste as well as cleaner growth targets.

“As a business, we are very conscious of the global initiative towards waste reduction and possibly, eradication. The idea of a circular economy combines three key goals in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, which are good health and wellbeing, clean water and sanitation and affordable and clean energy.

When we reduce plastic waste pollution, we would be addressing the issue of non-degradable waste, for which plastic wastes contribute immensely. Presently, the tons of plastic wastes that flows into our waters also raise concerns over our hydrological cycle, including the safety of our aquatic life and what eventually comes down as rain to fertilize our farm produce. Consequently, to enjoy good health and wellbeing, we can no longer wait, but to act against the potential hazards of increased plastic waste” Magunda stated.

Magunda added that “presently, the global trend is driving a waste to wealth initiative. For circular economy to thrive, the government must be deliberate in creating awareness about the opportunities that are available in proper waste management, such as the huge potentials of job creation. In terms of energy generation, geocycle is the way to go- turning waste into energy and recycled materials.

By this, we contribute to a reformative circular economy to achieve a zero-waste society. For instance, Guinness supports the effort of the government through our ‘4R’ waste management strategy, which are Reduction, Reuse, Recovery and Recycle. To this end, we will continue to advocate improved waste management practices, contribute to increased collection and recycling rates countrywide, and provide employment opportunities through scalable recycling solutions.”

In addition to creating awareness among Nigerian’s, the Guest Speaker, Mrs. Folashade Morgan, Chairperson, Food and Beverage Recycling Alliance (FBRA) advocated for an intense and purposeful environmental literacy programmes to be championed by the government, in collaboration with the organized private sector. These programmes will sensitise the people on the dangers and better ways to manage their plastic waste. She noted that issues affecting effective plastic waste management cuts across six critical areas, which are generation, collection, conversion, sorting, aggregation, and processing.

“Unfortunately, when you look as the level of waste management in Nigeria, it has a very low level of maturity. This is further compounded by the fact that we have low awareness among the users and the consumers themselves. There must be awareness on the separation of waste for easy management. Therefore, we have to be deliberate about awareness and enforcement for effective waste management. Plastic waste problem is accelerating and we must curb the spread,” Morgan stated.

In his remark, the Senior Technical Adviser, Office of the Senior Special Assistance to President on SDG, Dr. Bala Yusuf Yunusa said the government is committed to working with the organized private sector to achieve an effective plastic waste management regime. According to Yunusa, “we recognise as a government that the SDGs cannot be achieved with stand-alone projects and programmes.

They have to be ably mainstream into our development plans and programmes. We also realise that the public sector cannot do it alone, we have to engage the organized private sector. Going forward, we encourage the private sector to support the government through innovative financing that can facilitate the achievement of the SDGs. Therefore, we are also looking forward to working with the organized private sector to develop an integrated financing framework for the SDGs”.

Commenting on the objective of the CEO forum on sustainability, the Director, Lagos Business School (LBS) Sustainability Centre, Professor Chris Ogbechie said although Nigeria is not yet at the critical stage of dealing with plastic waste management, reports are showing that it may be very soon. Therefore, it is only wise that the country start looking in the direction of mitigation the possible challenge that an ineffective waste management may cause the country and indeed the global ecosystem on the long run.

337,Eastman reveals vision for sustainable future at LUXE PACK MONACO 2019,"KINGSPORT, Tenn., Sept. 17, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Global specialty plastics provider Eastman unveils the sustainable transformation of its cosmetics portfolio at LUXE PACK MONACO at the Grimaldi Forum Sept. 30 through Oct. 2. Eastman will showcase next-generation Eastman Trēva™ engineering bioplastic and introduce Eastman Cristal Revēl™ copolyesters, a new line of proprietary post-consumer recycled content (PCR) compounded polyesters. These new sustainable materials will participate alongside The Glass Polymer™ family of cosmetic materials in the circular economy via Eastman's recently announced unique recycling technology loops: mechanical recycling stream technologies, carbon renewal technology and advanced circular recycling.

Every year, the LUXE PACK in green Awards recognize the best sustainable packaging innovations in the world and the best responsible initiative. Eastman is pleased to be among this year's nominees for their transformative circular solutions. Winners will be announced Tuesday, Oct. 1.

""At Eastman, sustainability is at the core of who we are as a company. Investment in these new technologies underscores our unwavering commitment to ensure full participation in the circular economy,"" said Glenn Goldman, marketing director, Eastman Specialty Plastics. ""The products we are introducing today provide real solutions to sustainability challenges and represent a brighter future for our company and our partners.""

Eastman's mechanical recycling stream technologies leverage the municipal recycle stream to compound high quality PCR feedstock with proprietary combinations of virgin copolyester. The resulting resin addresses a diverse set of needs in color, processing, sustainability and mold thickness – all in a single pellet solution. Additionally, most of these products are compatible in the PET recycle stream, enabling brands to ""close the loop"" via an existing and familiar recycling infrastructure.

Carbon renewal technology (CRT) is a chemical recycling technology that diverts mixed plastic waste from the landfill and converts it to simple molecular components that are then reintroduced in the production of a variety of Eastman products, including Trēva. With CRT, newer generations of Trēva can benefit from recycled materials alongside its strong biocontent origins (>40 percent renewable content from sustainably sourced trees).

Advanced circular recycling (ACR) is a chemical recycling process leveraging methanolysis to introduce a mix of polyester waste, including colored PET and Eastman copolyesters, to produce virgin-like materials. Utilizing ACR, innovative products within The Glass Polymer family of cosmetic materials, such as Eastman Cristal™ EV600, will incorporate high percentages of recycled material with zero drop-off in performance, safety or aesthetics.

Mechanical recycling stream technologies and CRT are currently operational for scaled capacity, with full-scale operations expected for ACR within 24-36 months.

341,Circular economy: a coevolutionary perspective on diversity,"Abstract The research topic of circular economy has been discussed from different perspectives and with diverse foci in theory and practice. One of them is the idea of cradle-to-cradle. McDonough et al. (2003) emphasize three key tenets in their work: waste equals food, the use of solar energy and diversity. Diversity is the main focus of this paper. It is discussed from a biological perspective, the theory of coevolution. The aims of this paper are to discuss coevolution theory as a theoretical framework for diversity and to analyze the role of diversity within a manufacturer-customer relationship. Therefore, several coevolution scenarios of symbiotic relationships are discussed by referring to relevant elements of the coevolution theory and discussing them in an economic context. The enabling power of coevolution can be the adaptation to environmental changes through a diverse pool of materials and a good design.

345,Sustainable vision of circular economy with Re.VerSo,"Re.VerSo, a new textile platform that works together with its textile partners to produce a fully integrated, 100% Made in Italy textile collection, will be on hand at Première Vision this week to present refined and innovative materials that inspire creativity and infuse technology.

At the beginning of 2019, Re.VerSo has been selected as one of the protagonists of the Sustainable Thinking project of the Museo Salvatore Ferragamo, thanks to the value it bears in the field of responsible innovation. Representing excellence as the result of a culture of Made in Italy traditions, combined with a new vision of smart innovation, Re.VerSo covers the woven textiles market through the unique offer of A. Stelloni Collection by Mapel.

For the next season, A.Stelloni Collection by Mapel offers even more Re.VerSo solutions with strong focus on noble fibres, such as Re.VerSo Baby Camel and Re.VerSo Cashmere for coats and jackets. It features new finishes, draps, streaks, velours and, mostly, Re.VerSo Baby Camel developments, as the company is becoming leader for the sustainable Camel market.

Through all the entire collection including Re.VerSo, shine Alpaca, Wool, Mohair, both pure and in blends, in weights that are addressed to a wide range of items, from very light jackets to heavy coats in double, diagonal, 3D structures. The finishing always remains a fundamental added value of the collection; from laminates to sables to the most extreme Casentino finishes, a modern and innovative feature that defines the A.Stelloni Collection by Mapel line.

“Characterised by great creativity, a consolidated know-how and a very detail-oriented culture in the textiles industry, A. Stelloni Collection by Mapel represents a competitive industrial reality, increasingly engaged in research and development, which Mapel has become a leader in,” the brand says.

Originally from Prato, in the mid-60s the company started moving its first steps in the industry of fur fabrics with Vi-Ma carding, manufacturing semi-finished materials as a sub-contractor and commercialising synthetic fibers. Later on it has become a truly internationally renowned group with a fully vertical productive cycle that has diversified into footwear, clothing, furniture and technical fabrics. Thanks to a capillary commercial network across all continents, the Mapel SpA group is characterized by a flexible structure able to adapt to the market’s requests and by a natural predisposition for research, which is the real strength to be able to fetch and be ready for changes, just like A. Stelloni Collection shows us.

Re.VerSo works with its Italian qualified partners, such as Green Line, Nuova Fratelli Boretti for the raw material, A. Stelloni Collection by Mapel for textile fashion, Filpucci for the hi-end knitting threads, and Filatura C4 for design contract textile and for woven fabrics in general. Through these partnerships, Re.VerSo offers smart yarns and fabrics solutions with high aesthetics and quality, collecting, selecting, transforming pre-consumer wool and cashmere.

Re.VerSo represents a system of circular economy, with the addition of a new generation of values and quality. It is a promoter of environmental savings (-92% of water, -82% of energy consumption and -97% of carbon dioxide emissions as witnessed by ICEA LCA study, compared to virgin wool), an artisanal approach that distinguishes the industrial supply chain.

Leftovers can be sourced directly by Re.VerSo supply chain, otherwise the Re.VerSo advanced technology process welcomes retailers and brands to supply their pre-consumer wool and cashmere woven and knitted off cuts, transforming them into high-quality yarns and fabrics integrated for a circular economy.",United States,2019.09
346,The 2019 VERGE Vanguard | Greenbiz,"To combat climate change — let alone reverse it — it isn’t enough to break the rules of existing economic and social systems. We need to write entirely new ones.

To celebrate that spirit, GreenBiz created the VERGE Vanguard report in 2018: our recognition of individuals who are flouting the status quo to create products, services and business models that are blazing a trail to a cleaner future.

The second annual VERGE Vanguard report features a diverse group of 20 individuals who are inspiring an equitable, inclusive transition to a clean power grid; drawing the roadmap for a zero-emissions transportation system; building the framework for a more circular economy; and enabling communities and companies around the world to draw down levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

Engineers and entrepreneurs. Evangelists and organizers. Farmers and policy makers. This year’s list celebrates individuals who are disrupting business as usual from within large organizations — such as Cummins, Ford, General Mills, IKEA, REI and VMware. It also highlights the women behind entrepreneurial ventures such as Kiverdi (turning carbon into nutrients and bioproducts), LanzaTech (converting captured carbon into fuels and chemicals), Renewlogy (transforming plastic waste into fuel) and The RealReal (the circular fashion company that pulled off an IPO that values it far above $1 billion).

While their backgrounds are unique and diverse, the VERGE Vanguard honorees share a common conviction: to harness innovation to mitigate climate change and facilitate the clean economy transition.

Some people are content to uphold the status quo. Others are wired to disrupt it. Now, more than ever, the warming world could use far more of the latter. In that spirit, we’re honored to introduce the 2019 VERGE Vanguard, listed alphabetically.

Founder and chief executive officer, Renewlogy; Founder and director, Renew Oceans; Salt Lake City and Pune, India

While most people are just catching on to the global plastics pollution problem, Priyanka Bakaya has been working on solutions for a decade. And she hasn't started with low-hanging fruit.

Focusing on one of the thorniest pieces of the puzzle — the growing flow of low-value, post-consumer plastics filling landfills and waterways — the Australian-American entrepreneur founded Renewlogy as an MBA student at MIT.

An early commercial pioneer in chemical recycling, Renewlogy breaks down hard-to-recycle plastics into their basic molecular structure and converts them into higher-value liquid fuels. Renewlogy has two up-and-running facilities in Salt Lake City and Nova Scotia, partnerships with Dow's EnergyBag program and Canadian waste company Sustane Technologies, and recently was awarded a contract by the city of Phoenix to process the city's hard-to-recycle plastics.

But Bakaya recognizes technological innovation is just one part of the solution.

Given that just 10 rivers transport more than 90 percent of river-based plastics into the oceans, Bakaya started the nonprofit Renew Oceans in 2019 to address the most significant leakage points. Starting with one of the largest contributors, the Ganges River in India, her team partners with communities on collection strategies, conversion technology and behavior change. They aim to divert 100,000 pounds of ocean-bound plastics in the first year, with early support from the Alliance to End Plastic Waste.

""It's an enormous problem that we're trying to solve, and even a decade on, I'm still optimistic and hopeful that there really are solutions out there,"" she says.

A meme has taken over the energy decarbonization conversation: Electrify everything. Panama Bartholomy, the charismatic founder and director of the Building Decarbonization Coalition, is making that meme into a movement.

Buildings, responsible for 40 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, have been the Gordian Knot of the electrification movement — in large part because owners must upgrade to all-electric individually. Lack of awareness and financing upgrades make electrification an uphill battle against widespread natural gas infrastructure.

Bartholomy’s California-based coalition, launched in 2018, extols the benefits of electric appliances, including cost savings, safety and improved indoor air quality. Its message is catching on — fast. Over 50 local governments in California are considering policies to ban or restrict natural gas.

""This conversation has come out of nowhere and has vaulted to the front of the energy policy conversation,"" says Bartholomy, who previously served as an energy adviser in the California State Assembly and the California Energy Commission.

He credits the quick infiltration to the range of dedicated expertise of coalition members, which include 140 energy providers, builders, local government, nonprofits and utilities. That, and the coalition’s purposely positive, business-friendly message.

""That’s what I love about the coalition and the larger effort,"" he says. ""It is full of excitement and positivity about building a brighter future by getting rid of fossil fuels and relying on clean energy.""

Chris Cochran leads the ReFED think tank, which brings a broad range of stakeholders to the table to create an efficient, equitable food system. It quickly has become the go-to source for tools, events and actions on food waste, which amounts to 62 million tons each year in the United States alone.

Working with others is ""an exponential magnifier"" of what each actor can achieve alone, Cochran says. ReFED recently joined with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, along with manufacturers, retailers, consumer groups and academia, to develop a standard tool and methodology to build better food labels and prevent edibles from being tossed out prematurely. It is building a data and insights engine with players across sectors, using more than 50 data sources, and its accelerator for nonprofits nurtures early solutions in the space, such as creating ""an Uber for food recovery,"" as Cochran calls it.

Cochran's systems-innovation background includes helping create Walmart's first model for reducing food waste, examining the issue ""with a magnifying glass"" as a sustainability manager there. His ReFED role marries his aptitude for data and analytics with a love for food and agriculture. The latter passion took root while volunteering on a farm in Honduras, between completing a bachelor's in finance and accounting and a master's in international development. Cochran even established a nine-acre cocoa farm with local partners, which he still visits annually.

Kate Daly might be the personification of circularity's future in the United States.

Prior to her current role leading the Center for the Circular Economy at Closed Loop Partners, Daly spent more than a decade working for New York City, most recently heading industry initiatives for NYC's Economic Development Corporation.

In both positions, the mash-up of sustainability and innovation has been at the core of Daly's mandate. For New York, the goal was sustainable development and job creation in cleantech, smart cities and the circular economy. Since joining Closed Loop in January 2018, Daly has fostered collaboration among companies working toward an economy where materials are shared, re-used and continuously cycled.

One of the center's first initiatives was the NextGen Cup Challenge, which united Starbucks and McDonald's in search of a reusable cup. In apparel, the center partnered with EON, which provides digital identity technology, and brands, including H&M and Target, to establish a standardized system that identifies clothing for reuse, resale and repair. Another program connects Chinese companies with U.S. circular investment opportunities.

While regulations have helped fuel innovation in China and Europe, the United States doesn't have unified, top-down support for circularity; instead brands are driving innovation, Daly says, and regulation is coming from cities.

""I think the next big wave of circularity in the U.S. will be to link the municipal zero-waste efforts and the private-sector corporate efforts,"" she says.

Math geek Lisa Dyson heard her true calling in the late 1990s, after a visit to Princeton Plasma Physics Lab during her undergraduate study at Brandeis University, where the physics experiments made mathematics come alive. Now, the MIT Ph.D in physics is applying that knowledge alongside her research in bioengineering and energy to turn carbon dioxide into protein, oils and other biobased products.

Her eight-year-old company Kiverdi, co-founded with Chief Scientist John Reed, builds on an approach originally developed by NASA. Now, the company holds more than 50 related patents. Kiverdi helps companies such as Procter & Gamble work within their supply chains to break down feedstocks, including plastics or CO2 emissions, and catalyze them into materials that can be used for everything from plant nutrients to packaging. ""Typically, these are transformative changes, so they are board-level at some point,"" Dyson says.

She's also tackling the meaty challenge of sustainable food production. The mission of sister company Air Protein is to transform CO2 emissions in a matter of hours — essentially from thin air — into a substance that has the same protein profile as meat but that requires significantly less water and land to produce, according to Dyson.

""Our question was, ‘How can corporations play a role in doing things like reducing waste, combating climate change?'"" she says. ""Our solution was to make it profitable.""

Nigeria, expected to be the world's third-most-populous country by 2050, runs mostly on diesel generators. Not only is that an emissions nightmare, but each year 2 percent of GDP is lost on unreliable power, with $16 billion spent on backup generators. It's not uncommon for a bank to spend more on generators than on human resources and electric bills combined.

Ugwem Eneyo is determined to help Nigeria's energy infrastructure leapfrog into the 21st century. The CEO and co-founder of Shyft Power Solutions (formerly Solstice Energy Solutions) is building intelligent tools that manage distributed power sources. Business customers are beta-testing Shyft Base, which she likens to a ""Nest for energy management for distributed energy resources.""

Base replaces the ""dumb"" mechanical switches used by buildings to transfer to backup power. Naturally, there's an IoT-rich app that lets users analyze, control and optimize power sources to maximize efficiency and minimize costs and downtime. Eneyo is excited about the potential for eventually providing grid-level services, such as demand response and peer-to-peer resource-sharing, at scale.

Eneyo grew up in Edwardsville, Illinois — far from western Nigeria, where her extended family lives in the petro-polluted Niger Delta. Seeking to make change from within the industry, Eneyo spent several years at ExxonMobil as a risk adviser.

""If we solve some of these fundamental energy challenges, we're not just talking about the environment,"" she says. ""We're talking about solving some of the really challenging socioeconomic situations.""

Marcius Extavour went from designing a pancake-making robot in an undergrad engineering class to leading a $20 million global contest to reverse climate change by recycling carbon dioxide.

Extavour and his classmates at the University of Toronto started with no knowledge of how to build a robot. They won the contest and the spirit of collaboratively solving a problem with scrappiness never left him.

Extavour went on to earn his masters and Ph.D degrees, later serving as director of government and corporate partnerships for the university. He worked in the private sector for Nortel and Ontario's power utility, and logged public sector time as a science and technology policy fellow in the U.S. Senate.

Now, Extavour is channeling his love of competition at the helm of NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE, which aims to cultivate breakthrough technology to convert CO2 from power plants and industrial facilities into valuable products. While this is the most ambitious XPRIZE yet, Extavour is also developing a new carbon removal XPRIZE with an even bigger purse. Plus, he's rolling out the new Circular Carbon Network to connect innovators, capital providers and other key stakeholders creating value from carbon dioxide.

""As a black man from a biracial background, I didn't have a lot of role models in this work growing up,"" Extavour says, explaining that he hopes to be an inspiration to others in the African diaspora to pursue careers in science, technology and climate change.

Seven out of the 10 trucks you see on U.S. roads use diesel engines made by 100-year-old Indiana-based Cummins. But the auto gear maker that has been such a major player in the era of fossil fuel trucks and buses is starting to get serious about electrification.

And the leader ushering in Cummins' development of battery-powered vehicle systems is Julie Furber, a mathematician by training and former finance exec, who says she's often the only woman in the room in the male-dominated commercial auto industry.

Furber guides a 300-person ""startup"" within Cummins — one that has a $500 million budget over a three-year period — that is inking partnerships and beginning to sell vehicle hardware into markets including electric school and transit buses as well as electric last-mile delivery vans. Furber says it's still early days for the market for electric heavy-duty vehicles but notes that ""all signs are positive, and we are moving toward adoption.""

Furber, a British citizen, says her diverse background helps her think differently, which is required as Cummins looks to embrace a variety of commercial vehicle power options — ones that are cleaner, increasingly use batteries and ultimately move away from fossil fuels.

Jennifer Holmgren developed the world's first low-carbon, drop-in replacement aviation fuels at UOP, a Honeywell company. Until the fuels — made from animal fats and greases — withstood successful flight demonstrations with existing fleets from Virgin Atlantic and other major airlines, Holmgren says, nobody thought it was possible to fly with anything other than fossil fuels.

As CEO of LanzaTech, Holmgren is commercially proving a novel process technology that recycles waste carbon emissions into ethanol, then turns that ethanol into jet fuel. ""We need to turn carbon from a liability into an opportunity,"" she says. ""You can reduce your carbon problem and make money.""

Founded in New Zealand in 2005, LanzaTech licenses its intellectual property and sells engineering services to customers such as steel mills and other industrial facilities. A 2018 partnership with Virgin Atlantic aims to hasten the commercial viability of sustainable aviation fuel.

Holmgren's original passion was energy democracy, the idea that every person should have access to the energy that drives social advancement. The Colombia native, once dubbed the world's ""most compassionate businesswoman,"" realized access wouldn't do much good if the production process destroyed the planet and human health.

Holmgren believes the planet's looming problems have technological solutions that don't require massive sacrifice, and she is working to drive more investment in process technologies. ""We need to view every carbon molecule as precious,"" she says.

When Angela Hultberg returned to work at IKEA after maternity leave, she knew it was time to focus on sustainability.

Nurturing a newborn life during Sweden's mandated year-long parental leave engendered soul searching for the corporate tax lawyer-turned sustainability leader who describes her background as ""not a straight arrow.""

Hultberg already had been working on IKEA's transportation programs and had a background at Swedish truck maker Scania. Naturally, she started looking at how to address the 10,000 diesel-burning vehicles that move IKEA's products around the world.

The result is one of the retail industry's most aggressive and innovative plans to lower greenhouse gas emissions from goods delivery. Last year, the Inkga Group, parent company of IKEA, committed to having electric vehicles deliver the last-mile portion of all of its product shipments to customers by 2025. By next year, IKEA wants that to happen in Shanghai, Paris, Los Angeles, New York and Amsterdam.

The policy is already in practice in Shanghai, where IKEA's partners created an electric truck sharing platform that makes EV delivery economical and scalable. ""I'm super proud of what we've done in Shanghai,"" Hultberg says. ""We've moved past making commitments, and we're in deployment mode.""

Michelle Moore got her first taste of sustainability in the mid-1990s, when she got a job at carpet manufacturer Interface in her rural hometown of LaGrange, Georgia.

Seeing up close how a large company could turn around its environmental footprint and inspire others to do the same was invigorating, and Moore was hooked. She continued her sustainability work at The U.S. Green Building Council and at the White House during the Obama Administration.

Moore is now CEO of Groundswell, a nonprofit community solar developer in Washington, D.C., that helps neighborhoods and towns install community-owned solar projects and establish energy-efficiency programs that help low-income neighbors reduce their bills. The goal is to help more people, especially moderate and low-income families, gain access to clean energy and save money.

""Regardless of where you live in America, the people who have the least means pay the most for electricity,"" Moore says. ""Being able to provide relief through affordable solar energy, and through pairing that solar energy with energy efficiency, goes straight to families' bottom lines.""

Moore's philanthropic supporters and corporate sponsors include Bank of America Charitable Foundation, Citi Foundation's Community Progress Makers Fund and flooring manufacturer Mohawk Group, which partnered with Groundswell to install solar systems at community centers with green workforce development programs and schools with STEM programs.

A recent win that resonates personally: Groundswell helped install a solar project that serves the local housing authority in LaGrange.

Los Angeles-based attorney and advocate Mary Nichols has made a long career of fighting for environmental justice, especially in protecting clean air through California's innovative cap-and-trade program, which she oversees.

During her latest term as chair of the California Air Resources Board, Nichols has been a steadfast champion for emissions standards, opposed by the Trump administration. Her battle for a cleaner California has led to public health measures including banning toxic chemicals. But perhaps Nichols' greatest contribution was in championing California's sweeping climate action plan, one of the most aggressive in North America, which currently calls for emissions to be reduced by 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.

Nichols' legendary 45-plus-year career includes suing the federal government over air pollution in Los Angeles — the first suit under the Clean Air Act — and fighting acid rain with a cap-and-trade program at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under President Bill Clinton. She served as Secretary of Natural Resources for California Gov. Gray Davis, and on CARB since 1975; her current term as chair (her second) will end after 2020. Nichols also teaches at the University of California, Los Angeles.

""In California, we see the impacts of climate change all around us, but our efforts to curb its worst impacts are on track. ... This is great news for the health of Californians, the state's environment and its economy, even as we face the failure of our national leadership to address climate change,"" Nichols said in a statement last year.

Nicola Peill-Moelter was a driving force behind last year's groundbreaking joint corporate renewable power purchase agreement by Apple, Etsy, Swiss Re and Akamai Technologies, where Peill-Moelter was senior director of environmental sustainability at the time.

Through her work as a Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance board member, Peill-Moelter has built a network of sustainability professionals, which helped when Akamai was looking to buy renewables in the Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland energy market.

Teaming up with other companies to buy and divide the output from a wind or solar farm made more sense for Akamai, a company with relatively small electricity usage, than trying to negotiate a deal on its own. The result of this collaboration: two wind and solar energy farms in Illinois and Virginia that together will generate 290 megawatts, enough to power the equivalent of 74,000 homes.

Using sustainability as the catalyst for innovation drives Peill-Moelter's new role at VMware, where she is working on exploratory projects, including a demand-flexibility demonstration leveraging VMware's campus solar-powered microgrid.

Peill-Moelter, who holds degrees in chemical engineering and environmental engineering science, says she is driven by the belief that sustainability is good for business and that business can help scale sustainability solutions.

""People don't respond to doomsday messaging about climate change,"" she says. ""We've got to inspire action by painting a vision of a brighter future where people see an opportunity for themselves.""

San Francisco's knee-jerk approach to the arrival of shared e-scooters on its streets led to limited availability and a lack of low-income riders. Across the San Francisco Bay, though, it has been another story entirely: Oakland has been widely applauded for thoughtfully baking equity into its now-thriving scooter program.

The win is just one of several this year for the city's three-year-old Department of Transportation — dubbed OakDOT — and its head, Ryan Russo. Recruited from New York City's DOT leadership, Russo and his team have creatively and aggressively infused equity into OakDOT's signature new programs, such as its street paving plan and its unanimously approved bike plan.

The unique paving project uses income data and demographics to direct a big chunk of $100 million to fix potholes in historically underserved neighborhoods. While some of Oakland's wealthier and whiter homeowners in the hills might complain, Russo — who has two decades of transportation planning experience — is comfortable with the controversy. ""It's one piece of the puzzle that can be used to fight historical injustice,"" Russo told the Marketplace radio program.

Pothole paving kicked off in earnest this summer. Next stop is a program to redesign a major Oakland corridor to make biking safer and to highlight local artists. As Oakland continues to transform and grow in ways more and more influenced by Big Tech, the city can rest assured that its transportation future is being designed with empathy.

Jurriaan Ruys is a pioneer in making tree-planting profitable. The CEO of the Land Life Company seeks to plant trees on land equivalent in size to the United States plus China. The company is an early mover in the emerging ""restoration economy,"" which Ruys likens to the renewable energy industry a decade or two ago.

Land Life's robots can plant 120 trees at a time, and this year's goal is to plant 1.1 million trees. With geolocation, real-time tracking, drones and artificial intelligence, Land Life tracks the health of every tree. It's also working on a public tree monitoring app, which will feed into a database that Ruys believe will ""crack the code"" of optimizing reforestation in a handful of years.

Land Life's revenues exceed more than $4.5 million, with profitability anticipated in 2020. Its customers include NGOs and governments, along with corporate clients — including ABN AMRO, McKinsey, LeasePlan and Shell — seeking to meet CO2 offset goals. One marquee project is the ""Great Green Wall"" of China, which aims to fight desertification by planting trees across roughly a million square miles of China — a quarter of the country.

Ruys, a trained chemist and former McKinsey partner, says he enjoys bending in the dust ""among rattlesnakes and volunteers"" as much as plotting reforestation strategies, partnerships and technologies. Among his pet projects is the Cocoon, a recycled-paper device that shelters seedlings, boosting their survival in deserts.

The potential of regenerative agriculture to reverse climate change has become a major part of the climate conversation. A major driving force of this newly mainstream discussion: Shauna Sadowski.

Sadowski heads sustainability for the natural and organic operations at General Mills, where she's working to take regenerative agriculture from talk to action. That means leveraging the power of the multinational to incentivize growers to use farming and grazing practices that build healthy soils, preserve ecosystem diversity, sequester carbon and maintain numerous other benefits.

For Sadowski, this commitment is both personal and professional. Having grown up in a farm family in a rural prairie community in Saskatchewan, Canada, she knows firsthand the economic and environmental difficulties that farmers face. She's dedicated her career to tackling the multifaceted problem of the global food system. From roles at CLIF Bar and Annie's Organics, she's been an early mover in pushing companies, growers and the public forward on sustainability. Now, she works cross-functionally at General Mills to push even further: The company recently committed to advancing regenerative agriculture practices such as no-till and cover cropping on 1 million acres of farmland by 2030 — the largest commitment of its kind.

""Farming has an inherent connection to natural resources and living systems — soil, water, biodiversity — and they are being degraded at a global level,"" Sadowski says. ""But just as agriculture is part of the problem, it can also be part of the solution.""

Jigar Shah was in the room where it happened.

From founding SunEdison in 2003, where he pioneered the first no-money-down contract model for procuring clean energy, which helped catapult solar into the mainstream, to heading up Richard Branson's think tank Carbon War Room, Jigar Shah has been involved with developing or scaling just about every financial innovation in the clean energy sector. At Generate Capital, he finds and empowers entrepreneurs with creative ideas to scale clean energy globally.

Shah credits his Forrest Gump-esque omnipresence to his role as a problem solver. His real superpower could be enabling others to achieve their vision.

""I love to find someone that is super inspirational who has been working their butt off on something, and to the extent that I can, provided a little bit of support to get their best ideas unlocked,"" he says. ""That brings me great joy.""

To energy geeks, Shah's voice and bombastic opinions are familiar as a co-host of the Energy Gang podcast. He never pulls punches and is a passionate evangelist for the wealth opportunities available in the clean energy transition.

""I think it's important for folks to hear plainly what is promotional speak and what is aspirational speak and what is reality,"" Shah says. ""Being clear about what is possible matters.""

Ken Washington's experience in information technology has served him well as chief technology officer at Ford, which he joined in 2014 after a decade in space-related research and development at Lockheed Martin.

The automaker's sustainability-first growth plan relies heavily on data-driven innovation, a central focus for Washington for more than three decades. His deep engineering knowledge will be integral to helping Ford launch more than 40 electric vehicle models by 2022 and a robo-taxi service in 2021. Washington's team is also working with Agility Robotics to pair Ford autonomous vehicle technology with a two-legged, upright robot called ""Digit,"" which soon could be able to deliver packages.

Disruptive innovation is central to the future of all automakers but presents deep challenges such as how to handle privacy — an issue with which this former chief privacy officer is intimately familiar.

In the case of Digit, not only does technology need to deliver as expected, safely and securely, it must with evolving cultural expectations. That's one reason Washington, who earned doctorates in philosophy and nuclear engineering, has prioritized human-centric design principles.

As he told GreenBiz earlier this year, ""When you're dealing with a world that's changing, you have to change with it.""

Julie Wainwright is steering the circular economy's first unicorn. That is to say, the startup that Wainwright founded, online luxury consigner The RealReal, was valued at $1 billion earlier this year.

Under Wainwright's strong leadership, The RealReal been able to achieve a newfound level of success for a company that sits firmly within circular economy principles. The company buys used designer clothing, footwear and accessories, then sells them to new customers at lower price points — avoiding the extraction of virgin materials, extending product life and averting the landfill.

But it's not Wainwright's first experiment with innovative business models that leverage the power of technology to connect with clientele. She's an e-commerce veteran, having previously served as CEO at software company Berkeley Systems, Reel.com and Pets.com, the latter of dot-com bubble-bursting notoriety.

Her deep experience in the disruptive tech world has fostered a risk-taking and tenacity that have paid off for The RealReal. With the e-recommerce company, Wainwright is working to disrupt the apparel industry, the infamously unsustainable sector, by showing businesses the commercial viability of reuse and resale models in the face of fast fashion.

With consumers buying in at record rates, Wainwright is fostering an accessible and profitable circular economy.

Director of new business development and circular economy, REI Coop; Seattle

Peter Whitcomb wants to help us clean out our garages and get outside.

The retail expert has spent the last year and half heading up the development of a circular marketplace at REI Coop, the outdoor gear and apparel retailer.

The three-pronged initiative, which comprises re-commerce, rentals and activity centers, is based on the company's philosophy of ""creating access to the outdoors, not just selling stuff."" And with it, REI is making circularity a key part of its business plan.

""We're really responding to evolving customer expectations,"" says Whitcomb, who joined REI in 2016 from Amazon, where he managed the vendor relationship team specializing in cycling and other outdoor action sports. ""These are more environmentally friendly ways of consuming, and people are starting to recognize this.""

With a new online re-commerce business expected to launch in the fourth quarter, REI will buy back and resell equipment and apparel made by the brands it carries in exchange for store credit.

REI's new rental system will allow customers to reserve equipment online, then pick it up at stores and other locations, using these items for a short-term basis rather than buying them outright. A pilot program kicked off in August and will expand in 2020.

The company also has opened seven water-side activity centers around the United States, which offer hourly rentals of kayaks, canoes and paddleboards. It plans to open an additional four to eight new sites next year.",United States,2019.09
347,California governor vetos recycled content mandate,"UPDATE: Oct. 14, 2019: Gov. Gavin Newsom has vetoed AB 792, citing concerns about administrative burden for state regulators and a lack of accountability for plastics manufacturers.

 

 “While I support strong minimum recycled content standards, late amendments to this bill would result in a costly, burdensome process that undermines the worthy intent of this legislation,"" Newsom wrote in a Oct. 12 veto message.

 

 Newsom pledged to revisit the concept as part of broader changes to the struggling California Beverage Container Recycling Program. He did sign AB 54, a law intended to provide short-term relief to participating recyclers. This concludes an especially busy legislative session for California recycling issues.
• None Circular Economy and Pollution Reduction Act ( SB 54 AB 1080 ) never made it to a vote before California's state legislature concluded its 2019 session early Saturday morning. The bills would have required manufacturers to reduce waste from single-use packaging by 75%, and also required such packaging to be recyclable or compostable, by 2030.
• Ongoing opposition by trade associations representing the manufacturing and materials sector were among the roadblocks, per CalMatters and the Los Angeles Times. Lead sponsors Sen. Ben Allen and Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez are expected to revive the legislation in January 2020.
• Lawmakers did send at least one high-profile recycling bill (AB 792, sponsored by Assemblyman Phil Ting) to Gov. Gavin Newsom before adjourning. If signed into law, this will require beverage containers to be made with 50% recycled content by 2030.

California continues to be hit hard by the downturn in global commodity markets – due to its location, high recycling targets and other factors – so the state's 2019 legislation season was a particularly busy one for waste issues.

Bills intended to improve recycling education, market development and existing product stewardship programs were also approved and now await Newsom's signature.

AB 792 could set a particularly notable standard that may help drive domestic recycling markets – if companies don't opt to pay financial penalties instead. After originally calling for 100% recycled content by 2030 – a mark that companies such as Nestle Waters North America opposed, but have also said is achievable in specific instances – the bill's aims are now somewhat more modest. Plastic beverage containers covered under the bottle bill would have to include at least 10% post-consumer recycled content by 2021, and 25% by 2025, before the 50% target takes effect in 2030.

In addition to AB 792, Ting also got a bill through that could provide short-term relief from California's expanding bottle bill crisis. If signed, AB 54 will put $5 million toward grants for a mobile recycling pilot and also pause fines for grocery retailers that don't offer container redemption service.

Following the abrupt summer closure of rePlanet, the state's largest redemption center operator, this issue will likely require a bigger fix again next year.

By essentially rewriting the way consumer packaging was designed and recycled, supporters of SB 54/AB 1080 saw their plan as one way to eventually address the bottle bill issue. A final amendment last week shifted container manufacturers out of the bottle bill's financial requirements by 2026.

Other key amendments included lighter penalties for manufacturers that didn't meet the 2030 target and an expanded scope of materials beyond just plastics. These changes did successfully shift many large opponents to either supportive or neutral, but also stirred up issues with others such as the Glass Packaging Institute.

In the end, the Grocery Manufacturers Association, Plastics Industry Association, Waste Management and others remained opposed.

Common concerns included a lack of details about new infrastructure funding, the potential for state officials to have too much latitude in creating regulations and a general fear of losing control under an extended producer responsibility system. The latter criticism was among the most pressing factors for the recycling industry, though large companies such as Republic Services and Recology were still supportive.

Given how far the two bills got this session, and California's penchant for shifting the perception of what's possible when it comes to environmental regulation, this packaging debate isn't over.",United States,2019.09

352,Are you going to recycle that? It is National Recycling Day 2019,"Are you going to recycle that? It is National Recycling Day 2019

There’s no time like today - start a movement. Look around your home, office, school, and neighbourhood, interrogate your waste and ask everyone: #AreYouGoingToRecycleThat.

1. Before you throw something away, #InterrogateYourWaste ‘think before you bin’, and ask yourself #AreYouGoingToRecycleThat.

2. If you realise you can recycle an item of waste, please #SeparateAtSource.

3. Rinse out and flatten your recyclable material, and then place it in your multi-recycling bin.

To find out how recycling works in your area: visit www.mpactrecycling.co.za, or your community’s social media pages.

Mpact Recycling, South Africa’s leading recycler, is urging everyone to join the movement to support the circular economy, which refers to an ideal process whereby recyclable waste items are re-used or recycled into something new.

Here’s how their business is supporting our communities – and saving all-important landfill space:

1. In 2018, Mpact Recycling collected more than 630 000 tonnes of paper, plastic, glass and cans (recyclables).

2. Every tonne of recovered paper saves 3m3 of landfill space. Over the past 10 years, more than 11.3 million tonnes of paper and paper packaging have been recovered for recycling in South Africa. If baled, this amount would cover the surface of 2 055 soccer fields, one metre deep.

3. South Africa is ahead of international standards and is currently a recycling world leader. South Africa’s paper recovery rate is well above the global average of 59.3% (ICFPA, 2019 Sustainability Progress Report), sitting at 70% in 2018 according to RecyclePaperZA

5. 150 000 households within cities of Ekurhuleni, Tshwane and Johannesburg are supported by Mpact programmes.

6. More than 534 159 school children have been reached since the 2013 relaunch of Mpact Recycling’s ‘Ronnie Recycler’ schools programme.

7. Mpact has invested R150 million in recycling infrastructure since 2014.

8. Mpact Recycling’s liquid packaging recycling plant can recycle 24 000 tonnes of used liquid cartons (such as milk, juice or custard boxes) a year, saving 65 240m3 of landfill space and about 11 400 tonnes of carbon emissions.

It’s not all doom and gloom when it comes to our waste – so long as we recycle it.

Incredibly, according to the CSIR, recycling contributes R8.2 billion worth of resources into SA’s economy every year. The CSIR estimates that the recycling industry provides economic opportunities to between 60 000 and 90 000 waste pickers. Mpact Recycling, has over 45 buy-back centres in Gauteng which alone support 1000 waste pickers.

Mpact Recycling is encouraging more South Africans to think before they throw all their waste into one dustbin. Not only does recycling impact economic upliftment within the circular economy (which refers to an ideal process whereby recyclable waste items are re-used or recycled into something new), it is also a crucial way of saving landfill space.

Consider this – according to the department of environmental affairs, there are 826 landfill sites in South Africa. Of the six landfill sites in Gauteng, four have less than five years of capacity left.

Also, our municipalities have to pay for every tonne of waste that goes into the landfill. Imagine what else that money could be used for, all the while providing economic opportunities for entrepreneurs in the industry.

Do you know… the recycling lingo?



According to RecyclePaperZA, the paper recycling arm of Pamsa, 1.29 million tonnes of paper and paper packaging was diverted from landfills in 2018. However, according to Plastics SA, about 70% of the plastic that was recycled in South Africa had to first be sorted from a landfill in 2018. This illustrates that it is far better for waste to be sorted at the source, your home. Here’s the lingo to help put you in the know:

Separate at source: This refers to the separation of recyclable materials from general waste, at home or the office. Separating at source is the best way to divert waste from landfills and is the first step in the recycling journey.

Multi-recycling: This means separating your recyclables from your general waste and grouping certain types of recyclables together. It’s as easy as grouping glass, plastic and cans together in one bag. It’s best to keep your paper and cardboard recyclables separate so that any residual liquid doesn’t contaminate your paper waste.

Reclaimers: Also known as informal waste collectors, kerbside collectors and informal pickers. These are informal entrepreneurs who collect valuable recyclables from landfills, municipal dustbins and refuse bags along pavements. They are a valuable asset in the circular economy.

The circular economy: This refers to an ideal process whereby recyclable waste items are re-used or recycled into something new, in an effort to divert all valuable recyclable materials from the landfills.

Day 4: It’s so easy to join the movement, here’s how to do it today

South Africa’s recycling infrastructure has developed to make it as easy as possible to #SeparateAtSource, as certain recyclable materials can be grouped together. This multi-recycling simply means separating all your recyclables from your general waste. In fact, all your paper-based recyclables can go in one bag, making recycling accessible and easy. So, before you throw away your cereal boxes, milk and juice cartons, toilet rolls, cardboard, newspapers or magazines, interrogate your waste and ask yourself #AreYouGoingToRecycleThat.

The balance of your recyclables such as glass, plastic and cans can be placed in a separate bag, purely because they often carry liquid which can contaminate paper and cardboard.

How recycling is collected differs from community to community. There might be a formal recycling collector such as the Mpact Recycling kerbside programme, kerbside collectors who service particular residential areas, or local community collection points (such as the Ronnie Recycler programme) offered at schools, retirement villages or community centres.

Understanding the ways recycling works in your community, and the significant implications of not recycling, is a great way to start making your own positive impact on the volume of waste on South African landfills.

Here’s a list of what you can and can’t recycle:",United States,2019.09
353,Stemming the tide of trash: 5 essential reads on recycling,"A year after China upended global materials markets by banning imports of much solid waste, the effects are still rippling around the globe. Many U.S. recyclers are awash in materials they formerly sent to China for processing. Some cities with few options are burning recyclables in incinerators.

What would it take to reduce U.S. waste management headaches? These five essential reads offer some insights.

Waste is inevitable when products are designed to be used and then thrown away. Clyde Eiríkur Hull, professor of management at Rochester Institute of Technology, offers an alternative: a circular economy in which products are used, then recycled and remanufactured into new products.

Major U.S. companies, including GM, Caterpillar and Staples, are saving money through recycling and remanufacturing. But Hull says this could be greatly scaled up if the federal government required products to be designed with future reuse in mind and taxed goods that did not comply.

“In an entirely circular economy, the U.S. would most likely still import stuff from abroad, such as steel from China. But that steel would wind up being reused in American factories, employing tax-paying American workers to manufacture new goods,” he writes.

2. Get serious about recycling plastic

Of all materials in the waste stream, plastics pose the biggest challenge. They are used in a myriad of consumer goods, including many single-use items such as straws and cutlery, and can take centuries to break down. Kate O’Neill, professor of global environmental policy at the University of California, Berkeley, compares plastic waste to J.R.R. Tolkien’s One Ring, which “can be permanently destroyed only through incineration at extremely high temperatures.”

O’Neill identifies a number of steps to boost plastic recycling in the United States. They include better consumer education about sorting and disposal; less reliance on single-stream collection, which mixes plastics with other materials; more investment in scrap processing facilities; and steps to manage specific plastic products that are hard to recycle, such as 3D printer waste.

Conventional plastics are derived from fossil fuel, but they can also be made from renewable biological compounds that break down more easily, such as plant sugars. A key challenge with these products is making items that are strong enough to hold up during use but still biodegradable.

“A straw and cup that disintegrate halfway through your road trip are not much use at all,” observes Michigan State University biochemist Danny Ducat, whose lab is using photosynthetic bacteria to synthesize bioplastic feedstocks.

Bioplastics also require investments at the end of their life cycles, Ducat notes. Like other plant-based materials, such as food scraps, they will only degrade readily in composting facilities, where microbes break them down in the presence of oxygen. Buried in landfills, they will persist for decades or centuries, much like conventional plastics. They also are likely to persist if they end up in other cold places with little oxygen, such as the Arctic or deep ocean waters.

“This means that any breakthroughs in materials science need to be coupled with sustainable methods for bioplastic production and a well-oiled system to direct bioplastic goods into composting facilities,” Ducat writes.

Recycling is much more developed for metals than it is for plastics. In the United States, about 65 percent of old steel products and 40 to 65 percent of discarded aluminum products are recycled. But Daniel Cooper, assistant professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan, asserts that more could be done.

As Cooper explains, the United States exports or throws away a lot of cheap scrap metal, and imports expensive new metal. “As an already industrialized country, the U.S. needs little new metal to meet domestic demand,” he points out. More federal support for metals recycling, he asserts, could slash new steel and aluminum imports.

In addition to saving the money and resources that go into producing new metals, such a policy would cost Americans much less than the tariffs President Donald Trump has imposed on imported steel and aluminum.

Is burning trash instead of recycling it such a bad thing? Bucknell University economist Thomas Kinnaman thinks it’s worth a new look.

As Kinnaman acknowledges, waste incineration is much less popular in the United States than in other regions, including Japan and western Europe. Early U.S. waste combustion plants generated high levels of air pollutants, including hazardous substances such as dioxins, and often were sited in low-income and minority communities.

But new incinerators burn waste more thoroughly and trap pollutants more effectively. “As a result, dioxin emissions from incinerators with modern abatement technologies are currently near zero. Modern incinerators also include processes to generate electricity, heat water for district heating services, recycle the metals found in the ashes and build tiles from the remaining slag,” Kinnaman states.

Incineration still has clear disadvantages. It’s more expensive than landfilling, and Kinnaman sees some evidence that once countries burn more than 40 percent of their waste, it starts to replace recycling. Nonetheless, he contends, expanding its use in the United States – which currently burns less than 13 percent of its solid waste – could be more socially responsible than shipping plastic scrap to developing countries that are ill-equipped to dispose of it.

362,WWF-Philippines launches ‘No Plastics in Nature’ initiative,"The first anniversary of World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Philippines’s #AyokoNgPlastik movement was highlighted by the recent launching of its “No Plastics in Nature” Initiative that seeks to stop the flow of plastic waste by 2030.

The problem with plastics has been escalating for decades, where the Philippines has been identified as the world’s third-largest contributor of plastics in the ocean.

Plastic pollution has always been a huge issue in the country with the continuous generation of plastic wastes and poor waste management.

In 2016, global plastic production has reached 396 million metric tons (MMT), which translates to 53 kilograms of plastic per person on the planet.

A third of this number has already polluted the land or waterways, and with a projected increase of 40 percent by 2030, an additional 104 MMT will leak into nature in a business-as-usual scenario.

This poses harmful effects not only to the environment, but to human health, as well. It is estimated that on average, people could be swallowing approximately 5 grams of plastic every week.

Recognizing the threat brought about by plastic pollution, WWF-Philippines rolled out the #AyokoNgPlastik movement last year in the hopes of addressing the issue by creating awareness among Filipinos to reduce dependence on single-use plastics, such as straws, bags, bottles and cups, among others.

This year, WWF-Philippines reinforces its campaign against unnecessary plastics by adopting the No Plastics in Nature Initiative, a global WWF approach that intends to stop the flow of plastics into nature by 2030, through the elimination of unnecessary plastics, doubling reuse, recycling and recovery, and ensuring that the remaining plastic is sourced responsibly.

“With the No Plastics in Nature Initiative, we are hoping to make the Philippines free of unnecessary plastic wastes, but we cannot do this alone, we need the help of everyone. Every individual, company and institution should be mindful of the amount of plastics they produce and use daily, and take action accordingly, to make this goal a reality,” said Joel Palma, WWF-Philippines president and CEO.

The initiative is a holistic approach consisting of four main strategies. These are lobbying for a global legally binding agreement on plastic pollution, creating Plastic Smart Cities movement for cities and tourism destinations, initiating a Plastic Action (PACT) for businesses, and #AyokoNgPlastik for the general public.

The WWF network is continually pushing for a new international legally binding agreement to comprehensively address marine plastic pollution throughout the full life cycle from both production to disposal and recovery back into a circular loop.

This is the network’s response to the agreement made at the recent 14th Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention in Geneva, which stresses that the developing world could no longer be a plastic dumping ground and that any trade would require the prior consent from the receiving country.

Plastic Smart Cities, on the other hand, is a global movement of cities and tourism destinations that are fighting plastic pollution through improved collection, recycling, reduction of key waste plastics and landfill management.

Currently, the Philippines is working in six cities—including Davao City, Digos City, Tagum City, Manila City, Parañaque City, Island Garden City of Samal—and four municipalities, including Lupon, San Isidro, Santa Cruz and Donsol.

Meanwhile, WWF-Philippines was able to partner with at least 20 businesses for the sustainable journey movement where programs to reduce or eliminate single-use plastics in their supply chain system, workplace and business operations were implemented.

This program resulted in the prevention of over 1.5 million pieces of plastic waste from leaking into nature. Currently, WWF-Philippines is adopting PACT, a regional initiative on engaging businesses to take on a circular economy.

Finally, WWF-Philippines’s successful #AyokoNgPlastik movement will continue to educate the general public about plastic pollution, its impacts, and how people can help in addressing it through the Facebook community and the recently launched “AyokoNgPlastik” micro site.

Members of the movement have also demonstrated their commitment to this cause by signing the petition to support the call for a new legally binding international agreement on plastic pollution.",United States,2019.09

368,Demand for These Sustainability Practices Is Growing. Are You Listening?,"There is no question that restaurants have to make environmental sustainability a priority, but how they do so changes often, based on consumer, corporate, and sometimes governmental demands.

“Businesses are taking on a bigger sustainability role than they did before,” says Renee Yardley, senior vice president of sales and marketing for Sustana Group. “In the past, they would wait for legislation, but companies now see the consequences of waiting to be compliant and how that puts them behind. By getting ahead of sustainability, they can help frame the conversation.”

Here are three of the biggest sustainability trends impacting the foodservice industry today and how restaurants can implement them.

Today’s diners don’t just vote with their dollars on issues they care about, they take to social media to talk about the brands that live up to their standards. As a result, many investors and corporate stakeholders see the necessity of ensuring brands are driving real change and being open about it with their communities.

“Companies are learning they have to be transparent with customers because they are asking for it,” Yardley says.

What transparency looks like in practice varies from brand to brand, but Yardley says Sustana Group, for example, published a sustainability strategy that outlines the company's materiality impact and goals for the coming year. Restaurants can do the same

“Restaurants may also want to do an education program with customers,” Yardley says. “Another step is embedding sustainability leadership within the marketing and operations teams so that sustainability is taken into consideration for every major brand decision.”

Many brands are giving up styrofoam and other unsustainable packaging in favor of renewable, recycled, and recyclable materials. Today, paper is a strong contender for restaurants. Not only is paper lightweight and easy to use and store, but it’s also a natural resource with a longer life cycle than many other materials.

“Paper fiber can be recycled about seven times, so we can make maximum use of the fiber,” Yardley says. “It also degrades if it does get sent to a landfill and is one of the highest recovered materials on the market.”

Thinking about the life of products within the walls of the restaurant isn’t enough for a brand to be considered truly sustainable. Now, foodservice leadership must think about their brands’ place within the circular economy.

“The circular economy is about reducing waste by optimizing the use of resources,” Yardley says. “Recycling is just one part of the circular economy. It’s also thinking about how materials can be put back out into the consumer world again.”

One big priority for restaurants in the coming years is not just thinking about which packaging can be recycled, but which products can be reused, and which vendor partners can help them participate in the circular economy.

“It’s important to choose supply chain partners that use 100-percent post-consumer recycled fiber,” Yardley says. “At Sustana Fiber, we use recycled material from the start to create our EnviroLife Fiber, which is compliant with FDA standards for food-contact use and designed to be recyclable. We also help our customers see how they can bring that material back to the mill again for reuse so that all restaurants, big and small, can meet their sustainability goals and close that loop in the circular economy.”

370,California lawmakers stall on landmark legislation to curb plastic trash,"A trio of proposals would have tackled California’s waste crisis by slowing the flow of disposable goods —and single-use plastics — from manufacturers to landfills.

An ambitious push to make California the first state to stem the flow of plastic trash by phasing out single-use packaging and foodware failed early Saturday amid dogged industry opposition, as state lawmakers adjourned without acting on two far-reaching recycling bills.

However a third measure calling for more recycled plastic in beverage bottles did manage to get to a vote, and pass — one for three in a complex but urgent fight to address California’s recycling woes.

The mixed result represented one step forward, two steps back for the lawmakers who aimed to tackle California’s waste crisis as fragments of plastic drift through the depths of Monterey Bay and recycling centers close across the state.

The Legislature sent Gov. Gavin Newsom a bill requiring manufacturers to increase the amount of recycled plastic in beverage bottles to 50 percent over the next ten years. But they never voted on two other bills that called for a 75% reduction in waste from disposable packaging and foodware like forks, stirrers and cups. The lawmakers could revive the bills in January — but for now, the state will have to wait.

Julia Stein, supervising attorney at UCLA’s Frank G. Wells Environmental Law Clinic called it “a missed opportunity for California to take a leadership role in regulating plastic producers.”

Kathryn Phillips, director of Sierra Club California, saw less of a setback. “It’s always disappointing when things don’t go the ideal way,” she said. “But I actually think this is not a defeat, it’s just a delay.”

The decisions came as California’s recyclers are struggling to cope with markets in turmoil after China’s 2017 announcement that it would tighten contamination standards and ban imports of certain types of waste. California once exported about a third of its recycling, much of it to China, according to estimates from CalRecycle, California’s Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery.

Now, California’s recyclers are stockpiling or landfilling bales of plastic films, clamshell-style containers and even paper that they struggle to sell. rePlanet, a major collector of beverage containers, shuttered its 284 centers in California despite receiving $25 million from the state.

“We really have a crisis on our hands here,” said Sen. Ben Allen, the Santa Monica Democrat who, with Democratic Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez of San Diego, authored the two bills that didn’t receive a vote as the legislative year ended. The pair had wanted “to strike while the iron’s hot.”

Only Assemblymember Phil Ting, a Democrat from San Francisco, was able to. During legislative proceedings, Ting called his bill “the most aggressive recycling program regarding recycled plastic in bottles in the country.”

Still, the bill was more aggressive earlier on. It initially required that manufacturers make beverage bottles with 100% recycled plastic by 2035, but that was dialed back to an average of 50% by 2030. And where the measure once outlined fines calculated per bottle, now they’re calculated by weight — which cuts the cost of breaking the rules.

Major opponent Nestle Waters North America dropped its opposition and now supports the bill. The American Beverage Association, a heavy hitter, shifted from oppose to neutral. And Californians Against Waste supports the bill, although executive director Mark Murray was disappointed by the changes.

“The penalty is lower than the cost of recycling. So for the beverage industry that’s falling short, it’d be cheaper for them to pay the penalty than it would be to comply,” Murray said.

Ting said the new penalties are a compromise that still reduces plastic waste. “There were concerns that the penalties in the previous version … were too punitive — with some companies paying more than $12 million,” the lawmaker said in an emailed statement.

As for Allen and Gonzalez, their bills are on ice, for now. Their two bills, collectively called the California Circular Economy and Pollution Reduction Act, would have set a statewide goal of cutting three quarters of the waste from disposable packaging and products like straws and stirrers by Jan. 1, 2030. That would also have been the deadline for manufacturers to start making such goods out of completely recyclable or compostable materials.

The Act faced early opposition by the plastics and beverage industries who argued the bills were too punitive and that California should fix its recycling infrastructure before taking aim at manufacturers. Objections from many plastics and beverage businesses ultimately fell away, however. Major trade groups, including the American Chemistry Council and the American Beverage Association, shifted their positions to neutral. Plastic company Dow Inc. signed on in support, as did the California Grocers Association.

Still, the measures also picked up opposition. The Glass Packaging Institute, for instance, objected to having 100% recyclable glass lumped in with the rest of the packaging the legislation covered. And Gary Clifford, executive vice president of the waste collection and recycling company Athens Services thought the latest version went too far in stemming the waste stream.

“We were doing something with some of that waste,” he said. “We just thought it was a little overreaching right now.” Clifford didn’t want the bill to die, he said; he just wanted more time to change it.

Now, he may have that time. Sierra Club’s Phillips acknowledged that the push was a longshot. “They got a long way this session, but they were pretty ambitious bills,” she said.

Sen. Allen said negotiations will continue. “We make a few changes and we make it happen in the new year.”",United States,2019.09
371,From the Editorial Advisory Board: Recycling woes,"As the recycling industry faces serious challenges, Boulder recycling rates are relatively high. But they lag behind several other progressive U.S. cities, and Colorado overall recycles at a low rate. Your take?



In reality, we really have China to thank for first creating a giant market in the 1990s and 2000s to allow cities to vastly expand their recycling programs and then for reminding us in 2017 that maybe our recycling programs are not as efficient as they could be.

When times are good, it is easy for me to throw everything into the recycle bin without thinking about my consuming habits and then forget about it as it gets shipped to a far away land to be “dealt with.” When the tide goes out, however, I am forced to deal, literally and figuratively, with all this trash. For decades, the recycling industry’s dirty little secret has been that a lot of what gets recycled actually ends up in landfills. I am happy that the secret has been exposed and that we can now take a hard look at our consumption habits.

The mantra has always been that we must “reduce, reuse and recycle.” My problem with this mantra, as many others are beginning to realize, is that it places the burden of waste reduction on the individual. In reality, waste reduction and recycling is really a problem of collective action. If, as in individual, every decision to consume subsequently inundates me with trash, I will never win. For instance, when I order something from Amazon Prime, I get a box shipped within another box. Why have we, as a society, absolved manufacturers, sellers and other waste generators of their responsibility to ensure that the product I buy creates as little waste as possible or is created from materials that have a recycling market; as with any problem, doesn’t it make sense to go after the source? As individuals (and corporate shareholders) we should demand that companies have a plan for reducing packaging and other wasteful materials.

Many critics of recycling correctly point out that we aren’t running out of landfill space and that some materials take more energy to recycle than creating them from raw materials. But that view is short sighted. We have only one planet to live on and it has over 7 billion people and counting. We need to get to a point where our impact on our planet and each other is sustainable and that we are not creating environmental problems for our neighbors and future generations to solve.

Like many middle-class families in Minnesota in the mid-20th century, we had a lake cabin. Every Friday when my dad got off work my mom, dad, three siblings and our dog would pile into our pink Buick station wagon and head up to the lake. We would often stop at a drive-in restaurant to pick up hamburgers to eat while we were on the road. When we finished our dinner, we would roll down the windows and toss our hamburger wrappers and drink cups out onto the highway. My brother and I would argue about who got to throw out mom and dad’s trash. It is surprising even as I write this that we did not think a thing of it. We had no qualms. Out of sight, out of mind.

But at some point, we just stopped doing it. It felt abrupt. Lady Bird Johnson’s “Keep America Beautiful” campaign had hit its stride. The first lady might have been the most prominent face associated with this anti-highway pollution project, but it actually had been the result of a consortium of America’s biggest companies, nonprofits and the government, which wanted to tackle this issue once the interstate highways were built. It was wildly successful. “Don’t be a litterbug — every litter bit hurts” was the advertising slogan that caught on and became emblematic of a new way of thinking about our handling of personal waste. There were numerous public service ads that were broadcast, including the famous “crying Indian” ad, that were extremely effective.

This public-private partnership culminated in the Highway Beautification Act of 1965, when it became illegal to dump litter on the highway. Our changing behavior was reinforced by almost immediate positive results. Our highways and roads looked better quickly. Importantly, the anti-littering mentality has for the most part became a permanent part of our collective American psyche.

We need a huge collective effort like that now. Melania, are you busy?

I just returned from a vacation in Arkansas, where I spent four days on two houseboats with 30 people from five states. Glancing over all the food and “beverages” we just loaded in (no judgment), I made inquiries with the staff as to handling recycling. None, unless we wanted to haul it back to Colorado with us. The cognitive dissonance was viscerally alarming to me.

Over the course of our short trip, we generated some 22 bags of trash and a wild amount of food waste. It was a sobering reminder of our destructive contribution through consumption as I watched it all being pulled from our boat and taken via another boat to the least desirable outcome. Here we stood, on the edge of Arkansas’s largest lake, Lake Ouachita, surrounded by the pristine Ouachita National Forest in our country’s third worst state for waste reduction and diversion, as reported by Waste360. Only my Colorado friend and I gave the passing boat a moment’s regretful consideration as our other companions made jokes about how we could haul that back to Colorado if we really cared. They were not wrong.

If all of the data points to yes, recycling is worth it, then it seems (as in everything) we all have a role in the heavy lift we continue to face. This issue, like most, has intersectionality between personal, corporate and government responsibility and accountability. Governments have a critical role in creating and supporting the framework that its people are encouraged to participate in, just as we need to take individual (moral) responsibility for our daily consumption, including why and where we spend our dollars. Whether we use a carrot or a stick to incentivize participation on every level, it seems we urgently need to reexamine and recommit to our three R’s: reduce, reuse, recycle.

We can do better. We must do better.

Personally, I feel like I have done a lot. Maybe more than some of my counterparts when it is relatively convenient for me to do so. Regretfully, I wasn’t willing to haul 22 bags of our vacation residual home with me. Next year, on our new annual trip, I commit to having a plan and doing way better, because I can and we must.

Even though we’ve been following the “circular economy” model of sending gigantic ships filled with plastic bottles across the Pacific to be transformed into Barbie dolls and shipped back, it’s difficult to imagine that this recycling scenario actually saves much energy compared to other processes. However, it made financial sense and we felt good.

Since that avenue has been closed and efficient alternative solutions to managing our waste stream are not yet available to help us re-attain that feeling of virtue again, we can at least feel better about having the highest recycling rate in Colorado. With thousands of smart people all over the world working on potential solutions, the city and county should recognize that, in the meantime, they are already positioned to begin an innovative and reproducable program to reduce global warming by … wait for it … minimizing their spending!

Relying on our ranking as being one of the most “brain concentrated metro areas,” we can determine how many tons of carbon dioxide must be released to bring thousands of people and truckloads of goods together at Pearl Street to create a million dollars in sales taxes. While we may end up reducing our “vibrancy,” we can also minimize the local consumption of goods, the forgotten input side of the waste stream. It would also cast new light on the $40 million Alpine-Balsam purchase and the hundreds of millions for the electric utility municipalization effort. We could even ask if that raise for the city manager is worth the extra ten tons of CO2 being emitted per year.

However, while this self-regulating approach may be effective at reducing our carbon footprint, it’s not an option for Boulder, since we’re redefining the term “sustainability” to mean that we need to pass as much debt as possible to future generations to keep up with the Joneses.",United States,2019.09

376,The future of living: the big picture,"Imagine a world where bacteria eats our waste, where homes can expand or contract in size depending on how many people inhabit them, where we commute by drone, and the hearth, once the heart of our homes, along with cemeteries and crematoria are relegated to the history books.

As a small island nation we operate an open economy that has led the way in the banning of plastic bags and smoking in public places. But when it comes to future-proofing, our reputation is less shiny.

Our population is expected to increase by two million by the year 2051, according to projected figures from the CSO, with at least 500,000 of those living within the greater Dublin area, where 1.4 million people already reside – 28 per cent of the population.

This will put a drain on all our resources. Starting with water, a precious commodity that we should be harvesting, says David Browne, managing director of RKD Architects and president of the RIAI.

In Ireland, where it rains an average of between 75cm and 100cm on the east coast and 100 cm to 140cm on the west coast, according to 30-year average forecasts by Met Éireann, this makes sense. Peter Kindel of American architecture practice Skidmore, Ownings & Merrill (SOM), partnered with National Geographic magazine earlier this year to look at rainwater harvesting and other big issues. Its thinking is that absorbent rain gardens and pools will be used in the future to collect and filter rainwater.

Getting from A to B

Transport has to become carbon-free and for now, in Ireland, this will for the most part be achieved via electric cars. Currently cars are parked for 95 per cent of the time whereas they should be in motion for 95 per cent of the time, Browne says. “An initiative in Copenhagen to reduce the space available to cars every year by two per cent means the city incrementally reduces car usage of roads. This leaves more room for trams, buses and cyclists.”

“We need to look at transportation as a jigsaw that integrates all the pieces, the areas of expertise, be it bus, rail, car or taxi, working as one,” says John McCarthy, associate director and leader of intelligent mobility at Arup. “Mobility needs to become a service, and should be paid for like we currently pay for our other streaming services with all the forms of transport on offer talking to each other and relaying all that information to you, the customer.”

In the not too distant future flying taxis, vertical lift helicopters – volocopters – and drones may be considered more time-efficient ways to get around.

“How we make walking and cycling easier for city dwellers is a question that needs to be answered. We also need to make it easier for children to travel around on their own,” says McCarthy. Bray-based Design Partners is already thinking about this and has developed a device called Vibris-Pro, which uses haptics, the sense of touch to create vibrations that “tell” a cyclist when to turn left or right for delivery couriers. “The cyclist will still have to read the road signs, but won’t have their hearing compromised by the need to wear headphones to hear directions,” says creative director Cathal Loughnane.

With vegetarianism on the rise more people should be encouraged to grow their own vegetables, says Browne. He has cabbage, kale and herbs in raised beds in his back garden and suggests that “landscaped courtyards in apartment blocks should be used to grow fruit and vegetables for residents’ own use.” Similarly they can be grown in sky gardens or below ground in obsolete underground car parks using hydroponics and LED lighting, as suggested by SOM’s Peter Kindel.

Pester power is changing things too. Kids will no longer bother you to buy them chocolate bars. They won’t allow their bodies be adulterated by sugars and fats. Your smart fridge could row in here too and frown on your white wine consumption levels (maybe even ratting you out to your life and health insurers).

The purchase of groceries and food, that you don’t already grow yourself or within your own building, will become far more circumspect – the artificial intelligence system within the home will frown at any unnecessary food waste although the anaerobic bacteria in our bins will still love you for it. Irish firm WPN Energy is already piloting this service at The Yacht in Clontarf, Dublin 3.

Even more futuristic is the idea of a circular economy that removes the need for waste altogether, says Léan Doody, associate director and digital property and smart cities leader for Europe at Arup. “This requires manufacturers in the supply and value chains to remove packaging and to make products that can be dismantled and repaired, rather than being sent to landfill.”

The built-in obsolescence of current appliances and devices will require a rethink. We already have tech desks that can access appliances remotely to diagnose the problem and potentially repair it but she believes 3D printing could be used to download parts and/or encourage small repair shops which can print off and install parts for customers. “The whole business of repair has interesting implications for shops and for streetscapes,” she says.

Data will record everything we do and what we consume. “The waste and energy industries will benefit from such digital data around usage,” Doody says. In a project in Singapore, where 80 per cent of the housing is provided by the state, its big question is how to manage building facilities – proper data can predict when lifts are about to break down and minimise disruption to residents.

“The modern city will be dense and compact. It’s about densification and being more walkable, so you can get around without using a vehicle,” Kindel says. Currently in Ireland only 17 per cent of our housing stock is in apartments and the average height in Dublin is only two storey, Browne says. “If we could bring four to eight storeys throughout the city we would be able to accommodate all population growths.”

Prefabricated units will come of age – not the cold classrooms of our youth but rather as an affordable way to customise building. TopHat is a UK-based firm already rolling out a menu of unit options with a variety of floor and facade designs, customisation of internal layouts, and electric-powered, so zero-carbon in operation.

A Goldman Sachs investment of £75 million earlier this year signals changes for the entire house-building industry.

Space travel technology will be exploited by developers. The Tera, developed by New York-based AI Space Factory, was designed for long-term missions to Mars. It has an exterior 3D printed shell, constructed by an onsite robot that covers a wooden structure. The shell, made from a biopolymer basalt composite, developed from crops such as corn and sugar cane, is 50 per cent more durable than concrete and recycleable. This project is currently crowdfunding to help pay for the installation of one off-grid in upstate New York, where visitors will be able to stay from about $175 per night.

Homes that think for you

Many of us already use technology in the home. Siri or Alexa may switch on your lights, a phone app may boost the heating and get the shower running. Motion sensors will open and close doors for us. They will even raise or drop the toilet seat for you – ending that age-old battle between the sexes.

And while we laughed at the 1970s bidet brigade the idea of not having to use toilet paper in the future will finally become mainstream.

Will the future mean an end to vacuuming and dusting? No, says Michael Aldred, senior principal engineer at Dyson’s robotics team, but you won’t have to spend time doing it. “A robotic vacuum cleaner will identify habits, when you are and aren’t in the home, and clean accordingly, learning from previous experience how many times a week it should clean, and on what setting.”

And yet despite all the tech advances there is still no fix to escape the grim reaper. So where will we all end up? Cemeteries have overstayed their welcome on valuable land. From its work with laboratories Browne of RKD Architects imagines a ghoulish Damien Hirst-esque shark-tank set-up, where bodies will be immersed in tanks, frozen, and their granulated particles fall to the bottom of the tank for retrieval – a more carbon-neutral option than cremation.

Incremental change is the way forward, Browne says. “It won’t be a science-fiction world but more a gradual improvement.”",United States,2019.09

389,Recycling industry split on California bills that pave way for packaging EPR,"UPDATE: September 16, 2019: The Circular Economy and Pollution Act did not pass before California's 2019 legislative session adjourned. It will likely be revisited in 2020.

California may be on the verge of passing recycling legislation that supporters expect will be so consequential it has global implications.

The Circular Economy and Pollution Reduction Act (AB 1080 and SB 54) contain a complex array of provisions geared toward two overarching goals. The identical bills could see a final vote today, the last day of California's legislative session.

First, all single-use packaging sold in California on or after Jan. 1, 2030 would have to be recyclable or compostable. In parallel, producers would also have to reduce waste generated from their products 75% by 2030. These targets go well beyond any other state or federal recycling mandates in the U.S., which one of the lead bill authors said is exactly the point.

""The technology is there, it exists today. We know we can scale this. We know we can do this and if we don't act soon we will continue to double down on a crisis that is drowning our cities, drowning our rivers and streams and our children,"" said SB 54 sponsor Sen. Ben Allen during a Wednesday Assembly committee hearing. ""This is an opportunity here for global leadership.""

Supporters see an opportunity to address the rising costs of litter clean-up and collapsed recycling markets by making producers step up.

Opponents see their financial interests being threatened, are wary of losing control under a potential extended producer responsibility (EPR) system or otherwise disagree with specific elements of the wide-ranging legislation.

If the legislation is passed, the state's Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) would lead a regulatory process to establish a framework by 2024 for meeting its targets. The agency testified it's uncertain how big that task might be, but is ready to tackle it.

""As drafted we do think the department can implement this bill,"" said CalRecycle Director Scott Smithline during the committee hearing. ""This is a very significant program and it will require a significant response from the administration to implement.""

Given the options that producers could follow toward compliance (such as forming stewardship organizations), and the general uncertainty of a long regulatory process, this issue has split key players in California's recycling industry.

One of Sen. Allen's main industry supporters is Republic Services. Sitting together at the committee hearing, lobbyist Marc Aprea said certain details cause the company ""some level of consternation,"" but added that ""the alternative of no bill to Republic is not acceptable.""

Still, the company remains keenly interested in seeing a separate infrastructure funding bill introduced in 2020, which Allen said he's committed to working on.

Recology, another sizable player in the state, is also backing the measure. The employee-owned company has long been talking about the need for some form of producer payment to address market challenges, whether or not that ultimately means an EPR system as seen in other countries.

""EPR is a pretty broad term,"" Eric Potashner, vice president and director of strategic affairs, told Waste Dive. ""I can see a system where the [packaging] industry is paying for optical sorters and secondary MRFs and building end markets here in the U.S. as an example of that.""

Even with all of its recent investments in MRF equipment, Recology isn't sorting for specific materials within #3-7 plastics because it lacks market options.

""The industry should be on the hook for helping create that market,"" said Potashner, ""or if there is not going to be a market for it they should create something else.""

Other supporters with a stake in collection or processing include companies such as CR&R Environmental Services and local governments.

The largest industry opponent is Waste Management. The company has declined to comment on its position throughout the process, but sent a lobbyist to register opposition at the Wednesday hearing. EPR has repeatedly come up in the company's annual 10-K filings as something that ""could have a fundamental impact on the waste, recycling and other streams we manage and how we operate our business, including contract terms and pricing.""

Athens Services, the largest franchise contract holder in Los Angeles, is also opposed.

The California Refuse Recycling Council (CRRC) has taken a neutral stance, but a lobbyist for the group did raise concerns in the hearing about a perceived threat to ""over a billion dollars of existing solid waste recycling infrastructure"" if MRFs were to lose tonnage.

In response to these concerns, Sen. Allen emphasized ""nobody's forced into it, including the haulers"" and outlined why he believes the bill might create business opportunities.

""This doesn't cut out the need for this industry at all,"" he said. ""In fact, if anything it just emphasizes the importance of that industry.""

In a follow-up, CRRC reiterated it chose to stay neutral because it wants to work through the regulatory process and recognizes the need for action.

""We understand this is important policy to Californians,"" said Laura Ferrante, government affairs advocate for CRRC's northern district. ""[A]s an organization of California companies, we want to work together to provide solutions to the single use plastic problem that is inclusive of the existing recycling system.""

While the recycling industry's stance has been a factor, the reaction of consumer product companies, retailers and material associations have had greater influence on shaping the bill as it stands today. These players (or their members) will be directly on the hook for paying fees to fund the regulatory system and could also be liable for hefty financial penalties if targets aren't met.

The various twists and turns in bill language around these factors have made it hard for the most seasoned advocacy professionals in Sacramento to keep up.

A critical recent change was amending the bill to become material neutral and no longer just focus on single-use plastics. This moved the American Chemistry Council (ACC) from opposed to neutral, as explained in a Sept. 6 letter.

""I think it's fair to say that this puts all of our materials on the same playing field,"" Tim Shestek, ACC's senior director of state affairs, told Waste Dive. ""We have a very ambitious goal to meet in terms of these recycling targets, but we're committed to working on it.""

The new language also gained Dow's support, while the Plastics Industry Association remains opposed. Californians for Recycling and the Environment (a newly formed group with ties to bag manufacturer Novolex) and Dart Container are still opposed.

At the same time, the language's expanded scope moved the American Forest & Paper Association from neutral to opposed. The Glass Packaging Institute (GPI) has also come out in opposition, despite saying it supports the bill's broader intentions.

""There's no glass garbage patch in the Pacific Ocean,"" said GPI's lobbyist Mike Robson during the hearing. ""The glass container industry does not want to be part of a regulatory scheme to create a circular economy ... for a package that's already a circular package.""

The main concern is that glass could potentially be subject to regulatory fees under this program and California's existing bottle bill. Sen. Allen's latest amendment exempts those already covered under the container redemption program until 2026. This yielded an important shift to neutrality from the American Beverage Association and large beer companies.

Other notable amendments include eliminating a ban on non-compliant products, in favor of a fee, and creating recycling rate benchmarks in 2026 and 2028 ahead of the big 75% target for 2030. These various shifts have succeeded in securing neutral positions from many other large names such as Procter & Gamble, SC Johnson, Walmart, PepsiCo and many more. Some notable state groups representing retail and other sectors, such as the California Grocers Association, have also come out in direct support.

The Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA) remains opposed, despite saying its members support broader goals of increasing recycled content levels and making packaging more recyclable. GMA CEO Geoff Freeman published an op-ed in local papers this week critiquing CalRecycle's abilities to handle this task, given the collapse of California's container redemption system, and called for separate infrastructure and education efforts before any talk of financially binding EPR.

""EPR focuses on who pays for the system and I think that misses the larger point,"" Meghan Stasz, GMA's vice president of packaging and sustainability, told Waste Dive. ""Who writes the check doesn't actually fix the underlying recycling system.""

What comes next

The Circular Economy and Pollution Reduction Act's fate may not be known until late into the night, given that today is the end of California's 2019 legislative session.

During a Wednesday webinar, Heidi Sanborn of the National Stewardship Action Council – one of the most closely involved groups on this issue – gave it at least a 60% chance of passage. Since then, sources indicate lobbying activity has continued at heightened levels from all sides, with behind-the-scenes support from Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration as of this morning.

Opponents and skeptics have asked why such a sweeping change has to be initiated in quick fashion, and whether it could wait until next year. The pending arrival of companion infrastructure funding legislation is highly anticipated. Sen. Allen, his cosponsors and supportive environmental advocacy groups say the issue is too urgent to delay.

""I think that we need a bill like this to force the process forward,"" Emily Rusch, executive director of CalPIRG, told Waste Dive. ""If we require it, the infrastructure will be built.""

""In the face of unprecedented challenges from the loss of recycling markets and the growing plastic pollution crisis, the California legislature is taking decisive actions to redesign products, create in-state markets, and make producers responsible for the products they create,"" said Nick Lapis, director of advocacy for Californians Against Waste, in a statement.

If the legislation does go through, many have predicted that whatever gets hashed out in California will essentially become the national standard for packaging. The outcome of CalRecycle's potential regulatory process could also serve as a model, or perhaps be informed by, related EPR pushes going on in others at the moment too. Figuring out how to actually implement this system is bound to be an even more complex, and possibly contentious, process given just how high the stakes are for what California legislators are aiming to do.

""It's a big paradigm shift to have the producers be responsible for their products,"" said Jennie Romer, legal associate for the Surfrider Foundation's Plastic Pollution Initiative. ""This isn't going to be over after Friday or after the governor signs the bill.""

391,How Kohler turned production 'waste' into a new tile line | Greenbiz,"A half-dozen years ago, inspired by a biomimicry presentation during an annual company innovation retreat, tile and fixtures manufacturer Kohler created its WasteLAB. The idea: Experiment with nonhazardous vitreous and cast iron byproducts from the company’s production facilities, and assess their worth as materials that could be reused in other ways.

This spring, the WasteLAB introduced its first product based on these circular economy principles: a new ceramic line, the Ann Sacks Crackle Collection. 



The ""body"" of the tiles is made from otherwise landfill-bound pottery cull — broken pieces, if you will — from the toilet-making process. (The exact content of recycled materials isn’t disclosed, but the company says it’s ""almost 100 percent."") The scraps are pressed into powder and then molded into the appropriate shape. The amber and mahogany hues are derived from iron slag, and the glazes are made from enamel powders and leftover glaze collected during the processing of toilets, bathtubs and sinks.

Theresa Millard, project manager for sustainability and stewardship with the Kohler WasteLAB, said the performance of the Crackle Collection is the same as tiles made entirely of new materials, which was a major consideration for the design team. Indeed, the products are tested to the same commercial standards as any other Kohler product, Millard said.

""Nature doesn’t have waste,"" she said. ""We spent a lot of time questioning why something is good one moment and the next moment it’s trash.""

We spent a lot of time questioning why something is good one moment and the next moment it’s trash. DeeDee Gundberg, director of product development and design for Ann Sacks, said the tiles are marketed alongside sister offerings, with the sales team sharing the origin story. The rich colors made possible by the slag, along with the definition of its crackled surface, have resonated with early customers, Gundberg said.

""The response has been incredible,"" she wrote in response to questions submitted by GreenBiz. ""Sometimes a client falls in love with the tile because it’s the perfect color for their space, and as soon as they hear the story behind the tile, they develop a deeper emotional connection.""

This was not an overnight success

Millard, a ceramics artist by training who has been involved in product development for more than 15 years, said it took the Kohler designers in the WasteLab almost three years to figure this out and 18 months to get things right.

In large part, that’s because traditional production considerations, such as concerns over yield, aren’t really applicable in the WasteLAB. That means the tiles currently need to be manufactured using techniques that are separate from Kohler’s traditional operations — the lab operates separately, although the long-term vision is to embed these production ideas across the company’s sites.

Other considerations dictated the design: what quantities they could expect from the manufacturing line, especially as improvements are made; what price point customers would accept; as well as whether the tiles would require dramatically different sorts of packaging for protection during shipment.

You have to prove the hypothesis. Things might not add up the same. ""Persistence is something you have to embody, and there is a lot of technical work,"" Millard said. ""You have to prove the hypothesis. Things might not add up the same.""

With this first product on the market, the WasteLAB team is working on additional ways in which Kohler byproducts can be used in ""salable"" product offerings. ""We understand maybe 5 percent of what’s possible with this material set,"" she said.

As Kohler builds out its broad circular economy strategies, the WasteLAB team is also involved in other projects aimed at thinking of new uses for ""waste"" materials, such as how to reduce, or shred and reuse the corrugated cardboard from packaging in different applications for smaller, three-dimensional objects. ""The biggest opportunity is the conversation that we can foster with others,"" Millard said.",United States,2019.09
392,"Editorial: If California demands an end to plastic waste, the world's manufacturers will listen. So do it already","Will California show the nation how to take on the enormous problem of single-use plastic? Or will state lawmakers chicken out under heavy lobbying by plastic makers who are happy to continue to cover the world in discarded water bottles, used food wrappers and countless other pieces of disposable packaging?

We will find out soon. It’s not an overstatement to say that the fate of one of the world’s biggest sources of pollution hangs on the passage of the by Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego) and Sen. Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica). This legislation — which will be passed or die on Friday, the last day for the Legislature to pass new bills this year — would fundamentally reshape the product packaging industry by requiring products sold in the state to be wrapped in material that is being recycled or composted at a 75% rate by 2030.

This is important because even though most plastic is theoretically recyclable, very little of it actually gets recycled. Only about 6% of the some 83 billion metric tons of plastic ever produced has been recycled. The rest can be found somewhere in our environment, possibly as tiny particles in the ocean or the food you’re eating. And that gap is likely to grow. Even while plastic production has increased, the global demand for used plastic bottles and bags to turn into something else has all but dried up. If the bill becomes law, manufacturers over the next decade will have to build recycling plants for their plastic detergent containers and potato chip bags (creating manufacturing jobs! President Trump’s gonna love this law), or repackage them in a material that is compostable or already recycled at a high rate, such as glass.

And if California — which has the fifth-largest economy on the planet — demands sustainable packaging, the world’s manufacturers will listen.

What’s remarkable is how many organizations that stand to be affected have dropped their initial opposition, including the California Retailers Association, the American Beverage Association and the American Chemistry Council. The state’s grocers have gone one step further and now support the bill, which is really astonishing considering that grocery stores would see many of the products on their shelves reconfigured under this bill. Those businesses deserve a lot of credit for not standing in the way of a law that, while good for the planet, would force a big change to their operations.

Now it’s time for legislators and the governor to show their support. They have an important choice to make: They can show the world how to tackle the scourge of plastic trash. Or they can demonstrate how fear of political fallout is the biggest obstacle to our environmental challenges. No pressure.",United States,2019.09

400,Greiner Packaging presents solutions for a successful circular economy at FachPack 2019,"A world of new trends, perspectives, and opportunities awaits. Making its 2019 return, the FachPack trade show will extend across 12 exhibition halls to bring together around 45,000 visitors and more than 1,600 exhibitors specialising in all stages of the packaging process.

Greiner Packaging will also be in attendance, showcasing its wide range of products in Nuremberg, Germany, from September 24 to 26. This year’s clear focus will be on sustainable packaging solutions that can help in various ways to deliver a circular economy.

FachPack is regarded as Europe’s top trade show for packaging, processing, and technology. The event’s unique program will be staged over a three-day period, spanning packaging materials, packaging accessories, packaging machinery, labelling equipment, machinery and equipment for peripheral packaging processes, packaging printing and finishing, materials handling, packaging logistics, and services for the packaging industry. It is for these reasons that FachPack is the European packaging market’s confab of choice, drawing visitors from every industry that relies heavily on packaging.

As in previous years, Greiner Packaging will be making the most of its 2019 appearance to interact with existing and potential customers at FachPack. A clear focus of these discussions will be the subject of the circular economy – the need to keep plastic out of the natural environment and circulating in the economy for as long as possible. To achieve this goal, Greiner Packaging is pursuing various approaches. Design for Recycling products – packaging engineered from the outset for optimal recyclability – are one set of options that the plastics experts will be showcasing. In addition, they will be exhibiting food and nonfood solutions made of agro-based plastics and bioplastics as well as designs made of recycled materials, which may offer a genuine alternative to conventional packaging in the future.

Greiner Packaging will also be presenting an upgraded version of its K3Ò packaging, a cardboard-plastic combination that has already been a popular choice for some years and whose individual components are ideal for recycling. To make it even more straightforward for consumers to separate the cardboard and plastic, the zipper on the cardboard sleeve has been adjusted so that peeling off the sleeve is now an even more intuitive process. Digital watermarks can be added to the packaging too. Despite these markings being almost invisible, they can still be identified by cameras in waste sorting facilities, making them easier to recycle at the facilities themselves. Where requested by the customer, the cardboard sleeves on K3Ò packaging can be produced from grass paper as well. Greiner Packaging will also showcase best practice examples from this product area at FachPack.

This year’s trade show appearance will also feature tried-and-tested barrier technologies at center stage. These solutions are increasingly in demand among customers, given the vital importance of combating food waste by ensuring that products enjoy longer shelf lives. In this respect, Greiner Packaging is considered a pioneer in the industry, with its inert barrier technology (IBT) and multibarrier technology (MBT) giving customers different options that allow food to be stored for longer – even without the use of preservatives.

Plastic cutlery often has a poor reputation, although the trend toward more and more prepackaged meals and convenience foods is driving a boom in its use. At FachPack, Greiner Packaging will be exhibiting cutlery solutions made of PS, PP, as well as partially bio-based and industrially degradable materials. Also on display will be a series of prototypes made of PET, cardboard, and wood that could effectively replace conventional solutions in the years to come.

Greiner Packaging will be joined at FachPack by joint venture partner Cardbox Packaging, which produces creative packaging solutions from cardboard. As a sustainable raw material, cardboard is the perfect addition to Greiner Packaging’s range – and visitors will be able to see the impressive solutions developed by the two companies for themselves at the trade fair.

401,Rethinking Packaging in a ‘Zero-waste’ Fashion World,"Click here to read the full article.

Zero Waste Week, which was the first week of September, was a chance for consumers, businesses, municipalities, NGOs and non-profits to tout efforts (and successes) in their journey toward creating a circular economy where plastics, in particular, are not used.

On the heels of the global event, Robert Lockyer, chief executive officer and founder of Delta Global, is urging fashion brands and retailers to embrace “purpose over profit” where they adopt a waste-free approach and identity. Delta Global is a luxury packaging provider that “provides bespoke and sustainable solutions” to brands such as Tom Ford and Estée Lauder.

“With fashion giants such as Christian Dior embracing the waste-free beauty model and Nike announcing that the brand would only use recycled plastics in all their shoes and clothing by 2024, there is a worldwide determination to solve the environmental crisis we are all in,” the company said last week. Lockyer cited recent commitments made to do just that.

[See related story: G7 to Fashion Industry: This Season’s Color Is Green]

“Whilst there may be economic business risks in reducing your environmental footprint, a greater threat looms in irreversible climate change and risk of reputation,” Lockyer said. “More recently, we saw more than 30 leading brands commit to a G7 Fashion Pact. By working together to implement change, other brands will have to become part of the revolution in order to remain relevant to consumers. With little more than 10 years to stop the irreparable environmental effect, everyone should now be considering ‘purpose’ if they want the world to remain as we know it.”

In this case, Lockyer sees “purpose” as connoting a specific approach that is about “doing” and not just “talking.”

Lockyer warned of businesses that make a commitment, but don’t really take action. “Many companies are simply ‘greenwashing’ their messaging and not showing any tangible actions they have taken address the crisis,” he said. “Corporations should be made to monitor and report on their impact, plus set realistic targets dependent on size and turnover in order to sustain our future.”

With “zero waste,” one of the low-hanging fruit is in packaging. Lockyer cited Christine Dior as an example of a company creating a circular economy by taking a hard look at packages. He said Dior has removed “excess internal packaging, replaced instruction leaflets with scannable QR codes and [has] even removed plastic shop fit-outs for more durable glass ones.”

Central to the process is developing “circular product flows,” Lockyer said, adding that using compostable materials, “re-thinking dyes and inks, creating re-fillable and reusable items plus circulating waste back into the supply chain are all noticeable trends.”

“We need to ensure that the end of a product’s lifecycle is the beginning of another and educate the supply chain,” Lockyer added. “Whether it’s salvaging paper cut-offs into branded inserts or reclaimed paper handles, there’s plenty of options that manufacturers can be thinking about. Alternatively, can we be recycling apparel into designer handbags and new clothing lines?”

Dovetailing with sustainable practices and zero waste approaches is getting the message out to consumers and end-users — but in a sustainable way. “Zero waste shouldn’t mean you have to dilute the brand message or marketing,” Lockyer told WWD. “The world is digitalized and therefore you can promote your values via various communication strategies that require no material usage. Social media, online press, web collateral, podcasts, e-marketing can all reach an extensive audience that will want to get to know your brand because you are presenting an ethical stance and proving your commitment for environmental change.”

Lockyer also said that instead of delivering online goods in “a single-use plastic bag or a brown box with endless unnecessary packing material, develop artistically designed boxes, anti-crush systems and multifunctional uses for your packaging and items. Ensure your product is circular in its life possibilities, whether that’s remaining in a person’s home as an interior, selling on second-life sites, or ‘versatile’ to reuse in a different way.”

Lockyer said behavior change is needed to implement a circular economy. “Breaking away from everyday habits, whether that’s handing over a physical receipt in a store, to printing off an e-mail for a meeting is going to take some time, but creating a digitalized environment and encouraging employees and consumers to be involved in greening their every day is certainly the future.”

In regard to broader trends in sustainability, Lockyer said the fashion industry has already “seen consumers begin to embrace the idea of buying less, yet higher-quality pieces, with some brands creating entire lines designed to be ‘versatile.’ Think of garments that can be worn in many different ways, like wrap dresses and blouses that can be adapted into skirts — the fashion industry should look at designing minimal, multiperforming items that can be priced higher due to their unique selling point.”

“It’s not about being counterproductive by not making money; it’s about delivering a different message to your consumers,” he added.

403,Clariant making its additives fit for reuse,"Clariant is working to improve its additives, making them fit for re-use while avoiding material performance degradation. A showcase of this is the recycling and upcycling of flame-retardant polyamide (PA) post-industrial waste. Research institute Fraunhofer LBF confirms that PA6 and PA 66 engineering plastics containing Clariant’s halogen-free flame retardant Exolit OP maintain their UL 94 V-0 rating also when recycled back into production streams multiple times. This is advantageous both for the environment and manufacturers who are keen to increase their use of production waste and post-use recyclate in electrical, electronic and automotive applications.

Even under the assumption that plastics could be re-designed to a large extent to better fit to recycling, contaminants and additives may be accumulated in the material over several mechanical recycling cycles, and this may lead to poor performance or even health risks. Being phosphorus-based and halogen-free, choosing Exolit OP as a flame retardant is a safer and an environmentally superior option compared to legacy brominated flame retardants. Its use is even more relevant considering the rise in demand for PA66 engineering plastics, pushed by industry trends such as miniaturization in E&E, the shift to more lightweight materials in automotive and by rising mobility demand.

Electric vehicles have their specific material and safety requirements. Because of the high energy content of the battery and the high voltages and currents employed, not only flammability is a risk, but also electrical arcing, which can in turn lead to a fire. This risk is addressed by measuring the current tracking index (CTI) where short circuiting on a surface is mimicked. In this test, Exolit OP phosphinates perform exceptionally well. Furthermore, the “signal orange” color for high voltage parts can be a challenge to achieve and maintain, in particular for polyamides, in harsh under-the-hood conditions.

Confirmation from the Fraunhofer LBF Institute over a multi-year research collaboration with pinfa (the Phosphorus, Inorganic and Nitrogen Flame Retardants Association) that Exolit OP continues to deliver the same high-level fire protection throughout many recycling and reuse cycles is a further boost. Post-industrial waste of glass fiber-reinforced PA containing Exolit OP provides manufacturers with a genuine alternative to new material. Additives can ensure that mechanical performance is also not affected, meaning that internally recycled waste or regrind material can be used to produce the same applications without the need to downcycle. Test results were published (here).

In addition, Exolit OP is not subject to ecodesign application restrictions, for example the upcoming EcoDesign regulation for electronic displays based on the EcoDesign Directive (2009/125/EC) covering the recycling of plastics, which limits the use of halogenated flame retardants in enclosures and stands of electronic displays.

Stephan Lynen, Head of BU Additives, Clariant comments: “Global e-waste is estimated at approx. 50 million tonnes annually. of which only 20% are effectively recycled. At Clariant we are dedicated to ensuring our additives are not part of that waste. Take automobiles, one of the most recyclable engineered products, offering recovery rates of up to 90%. As the industry shifts towards a circular economy, any contribution we make to recyclable plastics that improves automotive waste management will support OEMs in selecting lighter weight and sustainable materials. With Exolit OP, OEMs can be confident of a flame retarded PA for their application which is recyclable and safe.”",United States,2019.09
404,"DeCal class: A guide to zero waste, building a sustainable future","It was sitting in an AP environmental science class as a senior in high school that Sage Lenier, a fourth-year student in conservation and resource studies, realized that it was her — and our — responsibility to find solutions to the planet’s environmental destruction.

“We were learning about food systems collapsing and water poisoning and all of these horrible things that were happening, and I was like, ‘Wait, what do we do about this?’ So, that’s kind of how the momentum started.”

When Lenier got to UC Berkeley in fall 2016, she knew she wanted to teach a student-led DeCal course. It was a big reason she chose Berkeley. At first, she thought she’d teach about how to live a zero waste lifestyle, but soon, her curriculum expanded to become what it is today: Zero Waste and Solutions for a Sustainable Future.

The course begins with learning about the science of modern waste streams and the history of “trash,” then dives into the circular economy, cradle-to-cradle design, the industrialization of modern food, sustainable cities and architecture, climate change and politics and decarbonization.

Basically, it’s a crash course in all the things we can do to save the planet. And Lenier says it’s not as hard as it might seem, if we all pitch in.

“The economic and social systems we currently have in place are set up in such a way that nearly everything we do is damaging the natural systems that keep us alive,” she tells a packed lecture hall on Monday, the first day of class. “But are humans truly ‘bad’ for the planet? No. It’s entirely possible to live happily, healthily and equitably within our ecological boundaries.

“Modern environmental discourse has, for the most part, focused on building awareness of environmental problems,” she continues. “But this course is entirely about environmental solutions — solutions that are scalable, actionable and hopeful. There is so much power in numbers. We have the power to make not only personal, but infrastructural change.”

When she first offered the course two years ago, there were 25 students enrolled. Now, four semesters later, there are more than 160 students in the class and another 45 on the waiting list.

Annie Mitchell, a second-year society and environment major, took the class last spring, and is a teaching assistant this semester. She says the course changed her life in ways she never expected.

“I came to Berkeley as a political science major, and I was pretty dead set on that,” says Mitchell. “Then last semester, when I took this course, I completely changed my passions and my academic focus. It just opened my eyes. Environmental sustainability and eco-friendliness should never be a luxury. That includes the education about it. I believe that this class is breaking down those barriers and making this knowledge accessible to everyone.”

The curriculum, for which Lenier won a best practice award last summer at the annual California Higher Education Sustainability Conference, has a strong history component, covering how we got to where we are: surrounded by mountains of toxic trash, dependent on industrialized farming, using inefficient transportation systems — with climate change looming over every moment of every day.

But then, she always offers an alternative — one that each of us can participate in starting now. And with each of us making a change, she says, it’ll pressure powerful industries to meet the demand.

“I learned a simple concept that stuck with me,” says Mitchell. “Sage talks about it a lot: Vote with your wallet. Although I can’t change the government or a corporation as an individual, I can make a change by saying ‘no’ to eating meat — not paying for meat anymore, and not supporting those practices. The same goes for single-use plastics.

“I think the biggest thing for me was just learning about my personal impact. How I, as an individual, can make changes and how I can influence others to do the same thing.”

Although Lenier will be graduating this spring, she’s not showing any signs of slowing down. She’s planning on turning the curriculum into a book this year, and hopes to publish it the summer after she graduates.

“I’m turning this course into my career,” says Lenier. “If it weren’t for Berkeley, I never would be the person I am today.”

And her class will continue. If all goes according to plan, one of this semester’s TAs will teach the course next year.

To read about the solutions that Lenier talks about in her course, visit the Zero Waste DeCal website, which includes notes on every lecture and a list of resources on everything from where to buy sustainable clothing to how to take free classes on urban cycling.

406,Dow to tackle plastic waste,"Dow and SCG recently signed a collaboration agreement to develop new complete recycling solutions to add value to plastic waste and prevent them from ending up in the environment. This agreement is an attempt to create a circular economy for plastic in Thailand.

“Our industry and society as a whole must do a better job of capturing and reusing plastic by scaling investments in collection, waste management, recycling technologies and new end-markets,” said Jim Fitterling, chief executive officer of Dow. “Dow continues to join forces with partners across the globe to more effectively reuse and recycle plastic waste. Working together with companies like SCG we can create a world where no plastic ends up in the environment.”

The agreement was based upon the shared vision to close the loop of plastics waste management for the reduction of plastic leakage to the environment.

The products anticipated from this collaboration are outputs of mechanical recycling, feedstock recycling as well as renewable feedstock, which include but are not limited to recycled resin, recycled products made from plastic waste, petrochemical feedstocks from plastic waste and renewable plastic resins.

“This collaboration not only represents our joint commitment in taking action to solve the problems through technology and making real changes but also provides us with new business opportunity, enhancing sustainability and bringing about practical solutions for recycling and upcycling of plastic waste in Thailand,” said Roongrote Rangsiyopash, president and chief executive officer of SCG.

SCG, Chemicals Business, is one of the largest integrated petrochemical companies in Thailand and a key industry leader in Asia. It offers a full range of petrochemical products ranging from upstream production of olefins to downstream production of 3 main plastics resins; polyethylene, polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride.

“Circular economy is an economic opportunity as much as a solution to a pressing environmental issue,” said Jonathan Penrice, president of Dow in Asia Pacific. “We will build on Dow’s unique materials science and application knowledge and our 50-year experience in Thailand to develop solutions that maximize the value of plastics in the country.”

This collaboration is aligned with the Thai government’s ambition to drastically increase the recycling rate of plastic waste in the country by 2027. Plastic waste in the environment is considered a critical environmental issue which Dow and SCG have innovated around in the past, such as developing certain technologies to incorporate materials derived from transformed plastic waste in polymer modified asphalt roads. This solution will add value to low or no value plastic waste such as multi-layer plastic packaging and contaminated plastic waste.

Most businesses today operate a linear system, whereby natural resources are extracted, transformed into products, and eventually disposed of. A circular economy, on the other hand, is aimed to reuse, renew and recycle valuable resources, thereby reducing environmental impact.

Dow and SCG are founding members of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, a not-for-profit organization, partnering with the finance community, government and civil society, including environmental and economic development NGOs to make the dream of a world without plastic waste a reality.",United States,2019.09
407,"Trending: Circular In, Single-Use Out for Food and Beverage Containers","This week, UK nonprofit Hubbub — creator of consumer behavior change initiatives around creating less waste and living more sustainably — awarded grants to a string of projects aimed at creating a circular economy for coffee cups.

Hubbub’s Cup Fund — launched in April and financed through a partnership with Starbucks (which introduced a 5p charge on paper cups in 2018 in the UK, to encourage customers to increase their use of reusable cups), to kickstart paper cup recycling across the UK — has now supported 12 recycling projects around the country with grants of between £50,000 to £100,000.

The Cup Fund is one of several of Starbucks’ efforts to curb coffee cup waste — earlier this year, the coffee giant chose 12 winners of the first Next Gen Cup Challenge, seeking solutions that redesign the fiber to-go cup and create a widely recyclable and/or compostable cup. In a post, Hubbub co-founder Trewin Restorick said the investment in coffee cup recycling facilities will enable the recycling of an extra 35 million cups per year.

The winning projects cover the London city center, along with other major cities, shopping centres, universities and motorway service stations.
• Learn more from WWF, National Geographic, Valutus and more on efforts to rethink the plastics value chain and strive for plastic neutrality — at SB'20 Long Beach. Tell me more! The Camden Climate Change Alliance — which as committed to a three-pronged approach to collect and recycle 570,000 cups in year 1: First, to build on a successful pilot project by doubling the number of street sweepers, who reduce contamination by separating and collecting coffee cups as they work; second, to install dedicated coffee cup recycling within office environments; and third, to incentivize independent coffee shops in the borough to recycle customer cups.
• Bywaters Waste and Recycling — will roll out a coffee cup recycling stream across three universities: University of Westminster, Queen Mary University of London and the London School of Economics. Bywaters will introduce reverse vending machines, rewards, coffee cup bins, re-branded cups and run a communications campaign and events to engage students. The project will also do collections using a zero-emission electric coffee cup recycling van, charged from a solar PV array. The project aims to recycle 600,000 cups in year 1.
• DS Smith — the British packaging giant is working to provide a coffee cup post-back service for cups from vending machines in public, private and municipal locations throughout the UK. The project aims to divert 24,000,000 cups from the general waste stream in year 1. According to edie, DS Smith said it launched the scheme after its own research found that more than half (58 percent) of British workers who buy to-go coffee dispose of the cup at their workplace at least twice a month.

In this post, Restorick says the Cup Fund was developed in close collaboration with the recycling industry, to ensure that all collected cups will be recycled within the UK, into a variety of new products — including high-quality stationery and cardboard boxes. The winners of the Cup Fund funding were announced in the same week that Hubbub launched #InTheLoop – a program aimed at boosting recycling infrastructure in cities, and changing consumer behaviors with regard to to-go food and beverage containers.

Meanwhile, over in Canada, Farm'r Eatery & Catering — a popular farm-to table, dine-in and take-out restaurant in downtown Toronto — is trialing a reusable take-out container, an answer to the restaurant's frustration with all the waste that’s created with every new take-out order.

""For dine-in, we use real plates and cutlery, then wash them for the next customer; the waste is minimal,” said Executive Chef Kyle Webster. “Unfortunately, with take-out, there is the container, plus there can be a bag and one-use cutlery, which really adds up. We are going through a ton of disposable products.""

As the cost and the garbage started to add up, the team at Farm'r began to explore alternatives to disposable containers.

""Biodegradable containers rarely end up in the proper composting facility, while recyclable containers are often contaminated and end up in landfill,"" says Greg Martin, one of the founders of Farm'r.

For a $4 deposit, customers can opt for the reusable container, then bring it back next time (dirty or clean) for a full refund. Farm'r also offers a $0.50 discount on every plate for bringing your own container. The new, reusable container itself is better to eat out of than one made of paper or biodegradable material; it's also dishwasher- and microwave-safe.

Farm'r is currently testing the new container, and also experimenting with a reusable glass container; the restaurant hopes to inspire more restaurants to adopt similar systems.

""Yes, it's more work to offer a reusable container and to wash them; but if we can start the habit now, maybe one day it can catch on and we can make a real impact,"" Webster said.",United States,2019.09
408,What is the circular economy? Here’s a perfect visual explanation,"The sculpture stands 11 feet tall, loaded with 1,500 oranges on top like a giant gumball machine filled with citrus. The fruits roll down a track, until they are sliced and squeezed of their juice, then dropped into a large vat. There, the peels are dried over the course of a day, pulverized into what looks like Cheeto dust, and mixed with an organic solvent (an acid made from sugarcane ) to create bioplastic gunk. That gunk is heated and melted into a microfilament. Then over the course of an hour, a 3D printer slowly extrudes the orange filament into the shape of a cup.

Finally, fresh orange juice pours into the vessel. What the customer is left with is a very literal cup of orange juice. Nearly everything is made from the orange itself. It’s nose-to-tail eating—for fruit.

This is Feel the Peel, an installation that is touring Italy for the next few months. Designed by Carlo Ratti Associati (CRA), in a commission for the multinational oil and gas company Eni, it’s no doubt a bit of corporate propaganda to make us forget about the ongoing toll of pumping and burning fossil fuels.

But bury that reality for a moment, and because the machine itself is an intriguing spectacle to behold. What CRA has done here is present a compelling metaphor for the circular economy.

It’s not quite perfect, granted: The cups must be thrown out or composted when you’re done.

412,Opinion: How California can create a future free of unnecessary plastic waste,"Our planet is being overwhelmed by single-use plastic waste. It’s most visible as litter that pollutes our streets, parks and beaches.

Research by Monterey Bay Aquarium scientists also found an alarming level of plastic in the water off California’s coast — from the surface to the seafloor.

As a marine biologist, I know ocean plastic pollution is a daunting problem. Since 1950, humans have produced eight billion tons of plastic globally; less than 10% has been recycled. Every nine minutes, about 300,000 pounds of plastic ends up in the ocean – the weight of a blue whale, the largest animal on Earth.

With plastic production continuing to increase, and recycling rates dropping as China and other nations refuse the mountains of waste we export, we can’t recycle our way to a solution for ocean plastic.

But I’m here to say: California, we’ve got this.

A big part of the problem is single-use products and packaging, items we use just once, then throw away. Research in Monterey Bay found that most plastic particles in the ocean match the type of plastic in everyday single-use consumer items — like water and soda bottles, take-out containers, disposable cups and lids, and a vast amount of packaging. Most of these items do not get recycled. Luckily, they offer a tremendous opportunity for design and innovation.

We need to invent new ways to enjoy consumer goods without the single-use waste. For the plastic that is necessary, we must create a system so we recycle 90 percent of what we use, not a meager 10 percent. Government, industry, business and consumers must all play a part in this solution. California is poised to lead the way.

The state Legislature is now considering the most ambitious single-use waste-reduction policy in the country. Bills by Assemblymember Lorena Gonzalez and State Senator Ben Allen set targets for reducing waste from all single-use packaging, as well as the 10 most commonly littered single-use plastic products. Manufacturers would help reach these goals by making their products reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2030—and helping ensure they are actually recycled and composted.

It’s a comprehensive model similar to what Europe is doing: create new markets for recyclables, require plastic producers to take responsibility for the lifetime impact of their products, and selectively ban some single-use items, like plastic grocery bags and take-out food packaging.

California’s economy is the fifth largest in the world. What we do here can help accelerate progress from the local to global scale. We can boost international market demand for innovative product delivery systems and packaging materials — creating new options that don’t pollute the ocean and imperil ocean wildlife. By prioritizing recycled products and packaging, California can inject new momentum into recycling and composting infrastructure, and create jobs right here in our state.

Showing leadership on the world’s most pressing environmental issues isn’t new for us. California has been out front on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, building a clean-energy economy, and protecting our ocean and coast. We’ve shown we can do right by the planet and improve our quality of life at the same time.

That’s why the aquarium and so many other conservation and science organizations have joined with government and business leaders to support SB 54 and AB 1080. Together, we can create a future free of unnecessary plastic waste. We believe California has the creativity and determination to design an economy that supports a healthy ocean and healthy people.

The California Circular Economy and Plastic Pollution Reduction Act provides the bold vision our state is known for. It will help create a better future for us all.

413,Volunteers needed for annual shoreline cleanup,"PROVIDENCE — Save The Bay will lead the 2019 Rhode Island coastal cleanup, part of an international effort by the Ocean Conservancy that involves more than a million volunteers removing trash from coastlines around the world.

More than 2,500 Rhode Islanders are expected to participate in the event, now in its 34th year. In addition to removing trash, volunteers record what they collect, providing valuable data on the materials are making their way into the ocean and onto shore.

July Lewis Save the Bay volunteer and internship manager, said additional cleanup volunteers are always welcome.

""Every year, we are amazed by how many people care deeply about our shoreline, and are willing to say ‘it's not OK to trash the bay,’” she said. “These community volunteers play a pivotal role in preserving shorelines for recreation and protecting the health of our oceans. We’re always looking for more people to join the cleanup effort.”

A cleanup is scheduled on Sept. 21 for the Weekapaug Breachway in Westerly. On separate cleanups of the Westerly and Charlestown shorelines, also on Sept. 21, volunteers will receive additional support from the Rhode Island Mobile Sportfishermen.

The Westerly Town Beach cleanup will take place on Sept. 14. Charlestown cleanups will be on Sept. 21 at the Charlestown Breachway and Blue Shutters Beach.

Each year, the Ocean Conservancy, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Washington, D.C., publishes a report documenting the amounts and types of trash removed from shorelines around the world, and the Rhode Island data is both shocking and impressive.

In 2018, 2,293 Rhode Islanders participated in the cleanup, removing 13,389 pounds of trash from 88 miles of the state’s coastline. Smaller pieces of plastic and foam constituted 28 percent of items collected. Cigarette butts accounted for 25 percent, with 38,427 collected, and 36,099 plastic bottles, cans, straws and coffee stirrers made up 23 percent of the collected waste.

“Marine debris is a global problem that requires a host of solutions,” said Allison Schutes, director of Ocean Conservancy’s International Coastal Cleanup. “Improving waste infrastructure in key areas, reducing our use of single-use plastics and moving towards a circular economy are all necessary to stop the flow of trash into our ocean, but cleaning up our beaches and waterways is an important piece of that puzzle, and we are so grateful for the hard work of Save The Bay and all the Rhode Island volunteers in helping us achieve our shared vision for a cleaner, healthier ocean.”

414,Pepsi: Getting enough RPET requires better infrastructure,"It’s clear the current recycling system can’t deliver sufficient resin for brand owners to hit their increasingly ambitious recycled-content goals. A PepsiCo executive recently discussed that supply gap.

Last fall, PepsiCo committed to hitting 25% recycled content across its portfolio of plastic packaging by 2025. It also said it would achieve 33% recycled plastic in its PET containers.

Those initiatives complement a separate goal by PepsiCo to make all its packaging recyclable, compostable or biodegradable by 2025.

Entities in the recycling industry have applauded higher recycled-content commitments but have also raised important questions about their feasibility, especially on the sourcing front. One recent report from an energy industry analysis firm concluded $3 billion in recycling investment will be needed in the next 10 years to support all of the recycled-content pledges already announced.

According to Roberta Barbieri, vice president of global sustainability at PepsiCo, the beverage giant understands the severity of the situation.

“That is indeed a problem,” Barbieri said in a recent interview. “We recognize it as such.”

Barbieri did not disclose PepsiCo’s current recycled-content percentage for its plastic packaging, but she said there’s work to be done. “We’ve got a ways to go till 25%, I’ll tell you that much,” she noted.

In 2015, recycled material accounted for 3.6% of the company’s RPET use, according to previous reports.

“We have an infrastructure gap,” said Barbieri. “We need more curbside recycling, we need more on-the-go recycling. And once you’ve collected it, you need the infrastructure to process it. The MRFs that do that processing are also scattered about.”

One part of PepsiCo’s strategy to help bolster that infrastructure has been its support of The Recycling Partnership, a corporate-backed group that works with municipalities and others to increase access to curbside collection, reduce contamination and improve recycling in other ways.

Last summer, PepsiCo contributed $10 million to the organization to help launch a program called All In On Recycling. The idea was that the initial $10 million would spur financial commitments from other companies to get the total to $25 million. Through a three-to-one grant matching paradigm The Recycling Partnership has with its community partners, the total cash infusion into recycling infrastructure could hit $100 million.

“That’s gone very well,” Barbieri said, noting that more updates on the program are likely to come in the coming months.

Barbieri said chemical recycling technologies could also be a piece of the puzzle to increase the supply of food-contact recycled plastic. PepsiCo last fall signed an offtake agreement with Canadian depolymerization firm Loop Industries and in April entered into a partnership with France-based Carbios, which uses enzymes to process PET.

Barbieri, however, acknowledged it will still be some time before chemical recycling outlets could supply major quantities of resin to brands.

“The good news it has tremendous potential,” Barbieri said. “The bad news is they are all small and in startup mode. And I think it will be years before it scales.”

Another notable sustainability strategy from PepsiCo is material substitution.

The company is going to start testing selling Aquafina water in aluminum cans in the U.S. next year and is transitioning Bubly spring water out of plastic.

The moves are by no means a signal PepsiCo is looking to abandon plastic – at the same time it made the Aquafina and Bubly announcement, the company said its Lifewtr brand was going to 100% RPET bottles. But the shift out of bottles does seem to be an indication that brand owners will be trying to move forward on their goals in multiple ways.

The Aquafina and Bubly shifts “are another step toward achieving the ambitious packaging goals we’ve set and moving toward a circular economy for packaging,” Barbieri said.

415,The circular economy: workshop on the challenges of turning waste into profit,"The phrase “reduce, reuse, recycle and recover” summarizes the idea behind the circular economy. Collaboration between companies or sectors aimed at symbiosis – where waste or waste by-products become a resource for something else – is central to business models that help build a circular economy. But despite technical and institutional progress towards circularity, knowledge, market and policy gaps remain.

The workshop gathered innovators, public authorities, and researchers in wastewater treatment and agriculture to discuss how to fill these gaps and transition to more circular and symbiotic systems.

Below are some highlights from the panel session.

Principles of industrial symbiosis and circularity are difficult to apply due to a general lack of local know-how. But there are success stories and a range of promising symbiotic initiatives in the pipeline.

Palopuro Agroecological Symbiosis in Finland and Kalundborg Symbiosis in Denmark are initiatives that demonstrate that it is possible to achieve symbiosis through a circular approach among stakeholders.

Palopuro Agroecological Symbiosis is a project based at the University of Helsinki working at a farm in Hyvinkää. The farm is the centre of a cooperative food production system based on energy and nutrient self-sufficiency. This multi-enterprise network aims to produce local, organic food using bioenergy and recycled nutrients, and also to serve as a model for organic food production and processing which is truly energy and nutrient self-sufficient. Kari Koppelmäki, the project coordinator, said there is always potential to introduce new technologies, but financial strain and lack of available markets are major challenges. There are plenty of available resources on farms which are underused, he explained, and it should therefore be easier to put these to work for environmental and economic benefits. However, Koppelmäki added that “balancing supply and demand is difficult when production is at a small scale, as one needs to recover phosphorus of the same quality as that on the market to be able to sell the product”.

Kalundborg municipality works with circular production of sludge, treating wastewater from homes and companies and delivering nutrient-rich sludge to farmers for use as fertilizer. Kalundborg Symbiosis – a partnership between nine public bodies and private companies – is the world’s first example of industrial symbiosis and has been running for more than 50 years. David Marhauer-Nimb, project leader at Kalundborg Symbiosis, explained that although the partnership evolved organically, its success is down to business agreements that are preceded by financial feasibility assessments, as well as analysis of mutual benefit among partners. Legislation can also support symbiotic models and help build bridges between innovation and markets. This underscores the importance of public procurement for fostering sustainable innovations.

In the parallel sessions the issue of public procurement was a key topic of discussion. Public procurement constitutes a major share of public spending and is increasingly recognized as an untapped potential for driving a transition towards a circular economy. Countries like Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands have new national policies in place to support circular procurement, and successful experiences are starting to emerge in the Baltic Sea region.

However, participants highlighted that challenges remain in implementing circular procurement in the agriculture and wastewater sectors. These included a lack of knowledge at local levels on the different types of procurement, and how these should be applied at the different stages of an innovation. For example, innovation procurement is not the same as sustainable innovation procurement. The former focuses on innovations that are not yet out in the market, while the latter is a “normal” type of procurement for existing products and services but with additional social and environmental criteria. Understanding the different types of procurement and improving their consistent use is crucial for testing innovations locally.

According to participants the biggest problem for innovators is surviving the so-called “valley of death” between innovation and market adoption, even when technical readiness is in place.",United States,2019.09
418,The future is clear - creating a net-zero circular economy powered by renewable energy.,"In June, the New York State legislature passed the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), a multi-faceted bill which mandates that the state go totally carbon-neutral by 2050. Although the final bill was not the legislation supported for years by environmental and social justice groups (social justice initiatives were removed in the final bill, i.e., the just transition retraining of employees transitioning from fossil fuels jobs and training initiatives for low income, climate-vulnerable communities), the CCLPA is still being hailed as a model for other states to transition away from carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

With an ultimate goal of creating a net-zero circular economy powered by renewable energy, the CLCPA will be required to source a minimum of 70% of its electrical power from renewable energy sources by 2030 and 100% by 2040. Although the numbers seem daunting, New York is starting with an advantage compared to other states. The state is already on its way to retiring its remaining coal generating electric plants by 2020. In addition, according to a New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) 2018 report, the state is already sourcing 60% of its electricity from carbon-free generating sources (they include nuclear power as a carbon-free source).

There are still major hurdles to overcome in the quest for carbon-neutrality by 2050. In addition to the issues with nuclear power (more on that later), even in states totally dependent on fossil-fuel power generation, electricity is the easiest sector to turn carbon-neutral. And it is only about one third of the current national CO2 footprint. Transportation and heating of buildings make up the bulk of the CO2 emissions.

The transportation sector is poised to be the next to be electrified. Starting with Volvo’s full line of Electric Vehicles (EV) or hybrids, all major automobile manufacturers have pledged a full line of EVs by 2023. Despite the rollback of emissions and fuel economy standards by the Federal Government, most manufacturers have pledged to continue to meet the higher standards previously set by the Obama White House and continue to be used as the California emissions standards (which are also used by New York and 12 other states). In addition, the global marketplace has similar mandates. After making the research and development investment to create the more efficient vehicle, it is unlikely that auto manufacturers will make a separate, less efficient vehicle for half of the US population. If EV advertisements during the Super Bowl are any indication, it looks like the car companies are becoming serious about making the transition to an electric fleet.

The days of EV range anxiety are becoming passé. 200+ mile battery range is already available in multiple models. Across the country, the electric charging infrastructure is being built out. In New York, Governor Cuomo has pledged to accelerate the growth of EV adoption in the state and to provide the financial support for the installation of charging stations, including building charging stations at all rest areas along the NYS Thruway.

The heating (and cooling) sector will be the harder piece of the puzzle. Since heating is a long-term investment, it will take many years to move millions of users from oil and gas heating. Homes with natural gas also use the fuel for their stoves and hot water heating. Although the state has done a number of initiatives to decrease the use of fossil fuels (weatherization/insulation programs, adding geothermal to the list of renewables available for tax credits), more needs to be done to move homes and businesses off fossil fuels. One current glaring omission in the state portfolio that it does not mandate the heating and cooling of any new construction is carbon free. California has done this by requiring all new builds in the state are equipped with solar panels.

Which brings us back to the electric sector. As stated earlier, nuclear power is currently counted in the 60% non-carbon electric generation figure. There are two issues (not counting the nuclear waste) with counting on nuclear as a long-range solution to meet the decarbonization goals for electricity. First, the Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant, about 30 miles from New York City, is scheduled to be decommissioned in 2021. Since it supplies about 25% of the power to New York City, this will leave a huge gap in not only the non-carbon sources, but the total in-state electric generation total needed to meet demand. Since the wind turbines scheduled to be built off the southern shores of Long Island are supposed to allow oil power generators on Long Island to be decommissioned, the first round of wind turbines will be at best, an even swap of non-carbon sources, but a net loss of generated power.

The second issue with nuclear power is that the plants are aging and costly to run. We are currently in the third year of a 12 year/$8 billion subsidy to allow the two remaining plants to operate. The state has not done any studies to show that their closure (both of which are beyond their designed life span) would increase the use of carbon-fueled electric facilities. Watchdogs have also noted that the subsidies will only delay the transition to renewable energy. In addition, with the prices of wind and solar going below all other forms of new power generation, and able to be built at a much quicker rate than the carbon or nuclear alternatives, using the subsidy on renewable energy would have a greater return on investment.

Meeting the 70% non-carbon electric power goal by 2030 will still be a challenge if the state does not improve the Article 10 process. Article 10 reviews and approves large-scale power projects in the state. Since its inception in 2013, over 40 projects have started the process (which should take 2-3 years), and only TWO projects have been approved. With the change from a Governor’s pledge to the legally binding mandate of the CLCPA, the rate of approved projects needs to improve greatly.

That is why two bills being proposed by local legislators is extremely troubling. The first, the “Opposition to Construction of Wind Turbine Farm on Lake Erie” would ban the consideration of wind turbines proposed in Lake Erie. This is being proposed in the Erie County Legislature Energy and Environment subcommittee and sponsored by County Executive candidate Lynne Dixon. Since the county does not have jurisdiction over the off-shore approval beyond 1500 feet of shore (and that technically is the jurisdiction of the town), this appears to be a challenge to the environmentally-friendly Poloncarz administration – the same administration that has already met the emissions reduction goals of the Paris Climate Accord. Worse yet, the resolution looks a lot like the law that Chris Collins proposed on a federal level in 2016 (right down to the reference to the Niagara Falls Air Force Base – it has been an Air Reserve Station since 2017) that died a quick death in his own subcommittee.

The second, is state legislation proposed by New York State Assembly members Angelo J. Morinello, R-Niagara Falls, and Mike Norris, R-Lockport (both NO votes on the CLCPA), are co-sponsoring a bill that would amend Article 10 of the Public Service Law to require a local referendum for large-scale energy projects in New York State. Instead of streamlining the process, this Assembly bill would extend the process by months, discouraging investment and new projects.

If that wasn’t bad enough, this week, Erie Community College is allowing State Senator Robert Ortt, R-Lockport to hold an anti-wind energy event (well outside of his district) that is trumpeting up pseudo-science and nocebo effects (attributing illnesses to unrelated factors) that has been disproven in multiple studies as well as for his anti-wind bill in 2016.

Scientists are in agreement that we need to eliminate our greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible. If we do not reduce our emissions to pre-1990 levels by 2030, our planet will likely be locked into a cycle of ever-increasing temperatures, rising sea levels, and with the inability to cope with rapid changes, mass extinction of species. Ensuring the future of life on this planet should not be a partisan issue. It’s no longer an issue that someone else will fix. With our changing climate, we need all of our local elected officials to be part of the solution and not the roadblock that stalls needed action until it is too late.",United States,2019.09
420,I helped create a unique upcycling system—but it won’t solve fashion’s waste problem,"Since 1976, our company has spun yarn for some of the world’s top fashion brands. With the industry continuously called to task for its wasteful ways, this year we created an upcycling system in Hong Kong, with the aim to recover the value of a discarded garment and to create a new (and renewable) resource.

The sustainable initiative we built is called the Billie System. It processes up to three tons of excess stock every day and converts it into upcycled slivers, which can be blended with other fibers and re-spun into yarn to create new garments.

Sounds impressive, right? Except that it’s a paltry effort in the face of our staggering textile waste problem.

In Hong Kong, where we’re based, we churn out 340 tons of textile waste every day. Our upcycling system, housed in a 20,000-square-foot facility, tackles barely 1% of that waste.

A survey of the rest of the world paints an even more alarming picture: The US delivers an estimated 12.7 million tons of textile waste to landfills a year; China produces a whopping 26 million.

At the rate we’re going, we need upcycling and recycling facilities to be as ubiquitous—and accessible—as convenience stores in every city if we really want a shot at processing the amount of waste we’re putting into landfills. In case it’s not obvious, that’s not going to happen.

Sustainability is the new black

So here’s the 3 trillion-dollar question: Can we actually make fashion sustainable?

Considering that the industry creates some 150 billion pieces of clothing for 7 billion humans each year, the sobering reality is that no, we can’t. Any model that encourages more consumption than is necessary is inherently unsustainable.

The correct question might now be: What can be done?

A system such as the Billie has its merits, but it also has its limits. In our case, it made sense for our company because of what we already have in place: a textile mill in Zhuhai, a city in China’s southern Guangdong province that borders Macau, which brings the distance of our garment-to-garment process travels to a mere 64 kilometers (just under 40 miles).

But a project like this may not be as practical elsewhere. And adding more production lines to the Billie so it can process more waste isn’t quite as simple as it sounds. Sending the world’s textile waste to Hong Kong to process doesn’t make sense, either.

In other words, duplicating the technology behind the Billie so it can be applied everywhere is a thrilling possibility, but that, too, would weigh heavily on the environment.

Anticipating excess inventory is the norm, which makes it impossible to escape being wasteful.

In the US, for instance, where only 3% of clothing in stores are made in the country, it means having to transport recycled fibers to places such as Bangladesh, China, Vietnam, and others, where the remaining 97% of clothing that retails in America is actually created, and then importing the final products back to the US.

Enter the circular economy, which proposes a closed-loop process of consumption. For supply chains such as the one in our company, the premise is simple. It encourages manufacturers to use waste as a resource instead of dumping materials and further burdening the planet.

o illustrate, harvesting crops such as cotton, used in 50% of the world’s textiles, involves up to 20,000 liters of water per kilogram. Finding a worthy replacement then saves a staggering amount of water, and relieves our cities of a portion of waste.

Here’s why that’s still just not enough: Material innovation only chips at a larger problem that can’t be solved by technology, advanced as it stands today. Under the linear system we’re accustomed to, cities consume more than 75% of natural resources, produce more than 50% of global waste, and emit between 60% and 80% of greenhouse gas emissions.

Addressing the problem at its very core requires something intangible: a change in perspective in the part of various stakeholders, including retailers, consumers, and suppliers.

Real change needs to be uncomfortable—for everyone

While retailers around the world are seeing that their impact on the planet is worth at least a conversation, and more brands are reviewing their supply chains and use of natural resources, might there exist a better path to sustainability?

In July, Spanish fast-fashion giant Zara committed to zero-discharge of hazardous chemicals from its supply chain by 2020, and vowed to eradicate single-use plastics by 2023. The sustainable cotton communiqué, a pledge to use 100% sustainable cotton by 2025, recently united brands including Nike, H&M, Ikea, Levi’s, Marks & Spencer, Woolworths, Adidas, Burberry, Timberland, as well as Kering Group’s portfolio of luxury fashion brands.

The media’s response has been mixed, with a fair amount of criticism. And perhaps rightfully so.

Here’s the thing. Retailers behind “sustainable” endeavors aren’t actively trying to deceive consumers; it’s just that the term “sustainable” has been so vastly and loosely defined, to the detriment of the movement itself. Unfortunately, not only do vague definitions allow everyone to perform the bare minimum and call it a day, these also encourage the belief among consumers that purchasing sustainable products is enough.

That sale seasons—note the plural—are a standard in most brands’ calendars is a testament to the state of overproduction in the fashion industry. Anticipating excess inventory is the norm, which makes it impossible to escape being wasteful. But does it have to be?

In crafting decreased quantities of products and fewer collections each year, retailers elevate the value of their inventory and reduce dead stock. Both suppliers and retailers must recognize that studying supply and demand is inseparable from any strategy rooted in sustainability. The decision-makers behind these companies are in a unique position to consider and address how promoting a surplus of inventory impacts the environment and even societal culture.

For our part as suppliers and textile companies, a regular review of operations and systems is necessary. Efforts to improve efficiency and ensure consistent quality in the manufacturing processes must be made so that waste in the form of “buffer production” is minimized. Ideally, production output should be exactly the order quantity placed by the customer, not more.

Just as importantly, consumers and governments need to work together to identify paths toward real solutions. Within communities, more education and awareness is essential. At a strategic level, there needs to be incentives, policies, bolstered enforcement measures, and sufficient funding that can not only encourage, but make mandatory a culture of recycling.

In short: Governments must make this a priority. Countries frequently cited among the top recyclers on the planet, including Germany, Japan, South Korea, Slovenia, and Austria, draw their success from key action points that make recycling a near-seamless operation, beginning with individual households. This means the burden can’t rest entirely on the fashion industry and its suppliers, or even our governments.

Thinking within the confines of a circular economy poses one of the biggest creative challenges of our generation, and old habits die hard. What the movement requires, far beyond the idea of Billie systems in place in the world’s biggest cities, is to hold ourselves accountable—because we are.

We need to change the very way we live and consume if we want to make an impact.",United States,2019.09
421,Basel Ban Amendment to Restrict International Trade in Hazardous Recyclables,"Beginning in December 2019, the Ban Amendment to the Basel Convention will prohibit shipments of hazardous waste from OECD countries to non-OECD countries for disposal or recovery. While the Ban Amendment was originally adopted by the parties to the Basel Convention in 1995, it languished pending the need for sufficient ratifications to meet its entry into force threshold. Two recent ratifications have finally brought the Ban Amendment over the finish line. The Basel Convention is a global agreement governing the transboundary movement of hazardous and other wastes. The Convention imposes controls and, in some instances, trade bans on covered waste shipments destined for final disposal or recycling, making the agreement the primary international legal framework governing the circular economy.

On September 6, 2019, Croatia submitted its ratification of the Basel Amendment to the depositary, following the ratification deposited by St. Kitts and Nevis on August 29, 2019. With those two ratifications, the Ban Amendment has reached the threshold requirement for ratification. The amendment will enter into force between parties who have accepted it on December 5, 2019 (i.e., 90 days after the depositary received Croatia’s ratification).

The Ban Amendment will affect shipments of “hazardous wastes” from parties listed in Annex VII of the Convention to countries not listed in Annex VII.

The parties listed in Annex VII are defined as those parties and other states that are members of the OECD, European Community (now the European Union), and Liechtenstein.

The Ban Amendment will prohibit the following shipments from Annex VII countries:
• All shipments of “hazardous wastes” (defined broadly under the Convention, and including anything that is hazardous in the exporting or importing country) to non-Annex VII countries for final disposal (i.e., operations specified in Annex IV A of the Convention).
• All shipments of a subset of hazardous wastes (i.e., those defined under Article 1(1)(a) of the Convention) to non-Annex VII countries for recycling and similar recovery operations specified in Annex IV B of the Convention.

If a waste is hazardous due to the laws of the exporting or importing country but not according to Article 1(1)(a) of the Convention, the Ban Amendment will not apply if the shipment is for recycling.

The Ban Amendment also does not affect shipments of “other wastes” under the Convention, which is significant in light of the recent amendment of the Convention to add certain plastic wastes as “other wastes” under Annex II. (For more information about the recent plastics amendment, please see this alert.)

Entry into force at the international level means that the Annex VII-listed countries that have ratified the Ban Amendment will be required to have legislation or other measures in place to implement the requirement to stop exports. That obligation will apply to Annex VII-listed parties who have ratified the agreement regardless of whether the destination country is a party to the Ban Amendment (or even to the Basel Convention itself) – it applies to all “states” not listed in Annex VII.

Many developing countries have also ratified the Ban Amendment, and they and others will likely adopt measures as a matter of their domestic law to refuse hazardous waste imports from Annex VII-listed countries (whether those countries on Annex VII have ratified the Ban Amendment or not). Indeed, many non-OECD countries have already done so by adopting import bans or refusing consents for certain imports.

The entry into force of the Ban Amendment could significantly affect logistics for management and recycling of hazardous wastes around the globe. It is noteworthy, for example, that several countries with advanced recycling infrastructure and capabilities (e.g., Singapore, China, and Malaysia) are not Annex VII countries. A wide range of recyclable hazardous wastes listed as presumptively hazardous in Annex VIII of the Convention are covered by the Ban Amendment, including certain types of end-of-life electrical and electronic equipment and scrap, certain types of waste batteries, and some spent catalysts. Beginning January 1, 2021, certain types of waste plastics will also be classified as presumptively hazardous under the Convention following recent amendments to Annex VIII. As a result, the Ban Amendment could disrupt some company recycling, product stewardship, and circular economy initiatives.

In addition, the Convention has initiated a process to review and amend several of the Convention annexes that collectively define the universe of wastes considered “hazardous.” The parties have convened an Expert Working Group that will meet again in November (in Bratislava, Slovakia) to continue negotiations on the review of annexes. The outcome of this review is expected to further define and possibly expand the scope of hazardous wastes covered by the Convention and the Ban Amendment.

The impact of the Ban Amendment’s entry into force may be tempered by the fact that the EU has already implemented the Ban Amendment in its Waste Shipment Regulation as a matter of EU law, so any Ban Amendment restrictions on shipments from the EU should already be in place.

As the US is a non-party to the Basel Convention, shipments of wastes covered under the Basel Convention (both “hazardous” and “other” wastes) are already prohibited under the Convention’s ban on trade with non-parties, unless the shipment is covered by a separate “Article 11” agreement allowing the movement. Similarly, the Ban Amendment will not affect trade between Annex VII countries, between non-Annex VII countries, or shipments of hazardous waste from a non-Annex VII country to an Annex VII country.

The Basel Convention continues to evolve and inform the environmental legal requirements governing the classification, management, and international movement of wastes in most countries worldwide. Companies should review their current waste management, product stewardship, and circular economy initiatives to ensure current and future operations account for the expanded scope of wastes covered by the Convention and the new legal prohibitions on certain international shipments.",United States,2019.09

423,"Partnerships, Recyclable K-Cups® Helping Keurig Dr Pepper Towards Waste-Reduction Goals","What happens when a coffee company known for its ethical sourcing merges with a major soda group? You see meaningful sustainability commitments extended across an even wider portfolio of drinks, and a much wider network of suppliers.

In the case of Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP), the company is also making progress on one of its environmental sticking points: the waste generated by individual coffee pods that keep many of us fueled throughout the day. This year, it will be converting to recyclable coffee pods across the US. It’s all part of a move towards 100 percent recyclable or compostable products; and it’s a timely commitment, given the global attention on packaging waste.

We caught up with Chief Sustainability Officer Monique Oxender, to learn more about the merging of the two companies and its new “Drink Well, Do Good” platform.

Keurig Green Mountain was fairly well known for its commitment to sustainability, while Dr Pepper was more focused on philanthropy. What was it like to merge the strategies of two well-established companies into a single vision?

Monique Oxender: Last year’s merger between Keurig Green Mountain and Dr Pepper Snapple Group provided an opportunity for us to reexamine all aspects of the business. With sustainability being one of the top priorities for our leadership team, we took a close look at our corporate responsibility agenda to identify key areas of strength and areas that needed improvement, to ensure we could make the most positive impact as the seventh largest food and beverage company in the United States.

We realized that while the two companies were different, our strengths complemented each other in ways that enabled us to be a greater force for good together. For example, Dr Pepper Snapple Group had well-established and respected community and philanthropic programs, such as Let’s Play; while Keurig Green Mountain’s integrated policies and practices for responsible sourcing and manufacturing helped make it a leader in sustainable coffee.

Throughout our first year as a new company, we never looked at sustainability in isolation. We engaged business leaders within and outside of our organization to better understand our strengths, risks and opportunities. A year later, corporate responsibility remains top of mind for all of us at KDP, and a key driver in our business actions and decisions. It truly is serving as our North Star; and our “Drink Well. Do Good” platform outlines how we’re going to get there, together. There’s involvement all the way up and engagement all the way down, whether it’s the leadership team setting strategy or our frontline employees managing day-to-day implementation. We’re all working together and are motivated by our ambition to make a positive impact with every drink.

Where do you see the biggest opportunities to make an impact?

MO: We know how serious the consequences are if we do not all work together to eliminate waste and that is a top priority at KDP, so our commitment to convert to 100 percent recyclable or compostable packaging across our entire portfolio by 2025 is critical. We are pleased to be making steady progress toward meeting that goal every day. After a successful conversion to recyclable K-Cup® pods in Canada last year, we are now rolling recyclable pods out across the United States. By the end of 2020, every K-Cup pod we manufacture will be recyclable.

We went a step further beyond just delivering recyclable K-Cup pods on the shelves. We worked with local recycling companies to make sure our newly designed K-Cup pods can be processed successfully throughout the recycling stream. We conducted more than a dozen tests at scale in municipal recycling facilities throughout North America, which proved our pods can be recovered with existing equipment — a finding further validated by the Association of Plastic Recyclers.

Our work in this space is helping to create best practices and momentum for others. Our collaboration with recyclers actually set new standards for how objects flow through MRFs, and has benefited other items like yogurt cups. We’ve joined groups like the World Wildlife Fund’s new ReSource activation hub to share what we’ve learned, and glean insights from others addressing the systemic issue of single-use plastics.

What will require the biggest change from the business as you pursue your new sustainability goals?

MO: We have demonstrated leadership in sourcing our coffee sustainably, and we are on-track toward achieving our commitment to responsibly source 100 percent of our coffee and brewers by 2020. We continue to be one of the largest global buyers of Fair Trade™ coffee and also purchase Rainforest Alliance® and UTZ certified coffee. The relationships we’ve developed with both farmers and manufacturing suppliers offer us an understanding of the challenges our supply chain communities face and insight into how to address them. We provide support through a variety of approaches — including direct supplier engagement, investments and industry coalitions. Our intent has been to provide our suppliers, their employees and their communities with the skills and tools they need to remain successful, drive sustainable business practices and positively impact local livelihoods.

We’re looking to apply that model of deep collaboration, transparency and social impact investment beyond coffee and brewers to other priority commodities and ingredients in our supply chain, such as aluminum, apples, corn and other sweeteners. It’s a big undertaking, but we’re up to the challenge.

KDP’s commitment to use 30 percent post-consumer recycled material in packaging is an interesting one, because the current supply of recycled plastic is limited. Will KDP need to get involved in increasing supply — and if so, how?

MO: With our new recycled content commitment, we have a vested interest in ensuring North America generates an abundant supply of quality recycled content. That means people need to recycle more and recyclers need to improve sortation. We can’t do it alone, so we have to partner to make this happen.

Partnerships are a big part of who we are as a company, and we will continue to collaborate across the industry as we work collectively toward a circular economy, where valuable items live long beyond their first use. I previously mentioned the work we’ve done with recycling facilities to prove that #5 plastic coffee pods can make it successfully through their stream, and are a valuable addition to the yogurt cups and butter containers they are already collecting. In addition, we’ve invested in the Closed Loop Fund to address recycling system bottlenecks; and partnered with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to help grow the circular economy. We team up with The Recycling Partnership and Keep America Beautiful, and work directly with municipalities to educate and encourage communities to practice recycle-right behavior.

It’s going to take leadership and teamwork across the value chain to make the transition from single-use to a regenerative, circular economy; but we’re driven to play an active role in achieving that future.

As a merged company, KDP has even more scale now than before. What are the pros and cons of this scale?

MO: A benefit of our new scale is being able to provide a wider variety of beverages to our customers. From Mott’s Sensibles juices to our Fair Trade-certified Green Mountain Coffee Roasters coffee, our goal is to satisfy any consumer beverage need — anytime, anywhere. We strive to build a well-balanced portfolio, one that today already includes 300 ready-to-drink options with less than 100 calories. And we will continue to invest in R&D and innovate, so that we’re responding to our consumers’ needs and providing more drinks with less sugar. Our combined resources enable us to do this faster, and on a much larger scale.

On the flip side, this also means that we have an expanded — and more varied — supply chain. We have to be thoughtful and consider our impact at every step, from the resources we depend on to make our products to the materials we use in our packaging. We are looking across our value chain to identify where we can make more of a positive impact, tackling important issues through partnership, innovation and investment. This is just the beginning.

425,Ulterion® Selected For The NextGen Consortium's Advanced Solutions Program,"TAYLORS, S.C., Sept. 10, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Ulterion® coatings from Jain Chem, Ltd. of Taylors, South Carolina has been selected as a participant in the NextGen Consortium's advanced solutions program to foster sustainable cup solutions for the food and beverage industry. The NextGen Consortium, a multi-year consortium of food and beverage service leaders, managed by Closed Loop Partners, with founding partners Starbucks and McDonald's, is searching for solutions that eliminate the entry of fiber-based cups into landfills.

""Jain Chem was selected to participate in the advanced solutions program because we recognized their importance in further developing the sustainable cup ecosystem,"" noted Daniel Liswood, Project Director of the NextGen Consortium at Closed Loop Partners.

""In our first major product rollout, over 3 million Ulterion®-coated paper cups have been sold by a major fast-food chain with zero complaints,"" notes Jain Chem sales manager Gil Sherman. ""That's great news for brand owners and our environment.""

It's estimated that if 100% of paper cups were converted to Ulterion® globally, it would eliminate 450 million pounds of LDPE production and 5.2 billion PET bottles from the landfill and marine waste streams annually.

""We are committed to fostering a circular economy through the adoption of Ulterion® coatings, a range of highly sustainable coatings for paper and paperboard packaging,"" Jain Chem CEO Manoj Jain said. ""Because Ulterion® coatings convert plastic bottle waste into non-plastic, recyclable materials, we can divert billions of plastic bottles from the landfill and marine waste streams annually. Cups and other packaging coated with Ulterion® are 100% repulpable, recyclable and do not inhibit compostability, which will divert millions of pounds of waste from landfills to the recycling stream.""

Ulterion® coatings are FDA approved, compliant with California's Proposition 65, BfR listed and are Plastic Free in compliance with Directive (EU) 2019/904. Paper cups coated with Ulterion® are available now from major cup converters throughout North America and will soon be available in Europe.

Founded in 1977, Jain Chem, Ltd. is a minority-owned company that creates green and sustainable chemistries that deliver performance, added value and a competitive edge, to help differentiate our customers from their competition. Jain Chem adheres to the highest quality, safety and environmental standards and our manufacturing facility is ISO 9001:2015 certified.

428,Digitalization to drive circular economy according to German waste association,"""Digitalization will significantly change today's circular economy,"" according to Naemi Denz, the Managing Director of the Waste Treatment and Recycling Association in the German Engineering Federation (VDMA). Denz says that digitally transmitted information, for example, will ensure that secondary raw materials can be designed with even greater precision. This topic will be among many at IFAT 2020, set for Germany in May, 2020.

""In the future, the composition of the input material will be analyzed in real time and the treatment process will be controlled by the output,"" says Denz. ""For mechanical and plant engineering this means that the trend moves away from pure mechanical treatment. Measuring and analysis devices will be used more commonly, as are automation components.""

Using digital watermarks for sorting packaging

One current example of this new approach is the Holy Grail project of the association Petcore Europe: over the past three years, 29 well-known companies from the consumer goods and recycling industries have made efforts to use digital watermarks to create a better basis for sorting plastic packaging. These watermarks—i.e. codes invisible to the human eye—were printed on labels, sleeves, films, bags and bottles. Specific scanners can then read them and thus give information on the packagings' material and whether they contained food, cosmetics or detergents. According to Petcore Europe, existing sorting systems can be easily upgraded with such a scanner. The next step currently planned is to test the new technology on a production line and on an industrial scale.

Intelligent injection molding machines and robotic disassembly

Digitalization also can enable further process innovations: for example, digitally supported injection molding machines that react to material fluctuations and thus process recycled plastics better than before. Robotic systems equipped with artificial intelligence would be able to accelerate and improve dismantling or waste separation. And given the current high transaction costs, new digital market and logistics platforms could help to match supply and demand even more easily.",United States,2019.09
431,From bread to beer: Woolworths helps create its first circular economy craft beer 'Loafer',"Unsold loaves of bread from Woolworths Supermarkets have been repurposed and brewed into ‘Loafer’ – a limited edition pale ale.

The beer which is being sold exclusively in BWS and Dan Murphy’s will also help raise funds for the Feed Appeal, to help put meals on the table for Australians impacted by food insecurity.

Dubbed as the Woolworths Group’s first circular economy beer, more than 350kg of leftover bread from Woolworths Supermarkets has been diverted from potential landfill to help create the unique brew.

Woolworths Head of Sustainability, Adrian Cullen said; “We like to constantly challenge ourselves in the sustainability and community space and look at how we can make an impact simply by doing things differently.

“The ability to divert surplus food away from landfill, and to help support our local food rescue partners to help feed Australians that would otherwise go hungry, is a critical part of our day-to-day operations and support of the community.

“We’re excited to bring to Australians our first circular economy craft beer. For every 6 pack of ‘Loafer’ purchased, you will not only help to put a meal on the table for someone in need, but you will also be enjoying a beer that has helped divert unsold loaves of bread from heading to landfill.”

The craft beer has been made by Tribe Breweries, based in Goulburn, New South Wales.

Tribe Breweries Head of Innovation, Josh Gaudry said; “We wanted to create a beautiful craft beer and were excited to be able to support Feed Appeal and Woolworths in their fight against hunger and food waste.

“Through collecting rescued bread from Woolworths, we were able to incorporate this into the base of our brew, and lovingly crafted each beer with the aroma of fresh toast to produce an easy going pale ale with bright hoppy aromas reminiscent of pear and pineapple.

“If you ask me, it’s the best thing since sliced bread.”

100% of funds raised through the purchase of ‘Loafer’ goes directly to support Feed Appeal, a not for profit organisation that provides grants to support local charities that deliver food relief programs and meals to vulnerable Australians who need it most.

Feed Appeal CEO, Katherine Gokavi-Whaley said; “Feed Appeal is here to help everyday Australian families who rely on food charities in their local community for their next meal.

“All money raised through the purchase of ‘Loafer’ goes directly to community food relief charities to supply ovens, freezers, cool rooms, transport and other vital infrastructure to help them store, cook and share meals often cooked from rescued food to meet the growing demand for food relief.

“We are pleased to see that there is now good beer, doing good on the market.”

‘Loafer’ is available while stocks last exclusively at BWS and Dan Murphy’s stores across Australia. For every 6 pack sold ($25), 50 cents is donated to Feed Appeal which equates to one meal. For every carton sold ($73), $2 is donated to Feed Appeal, which can help to feed a family of four.",United States,2019.09

“The ability to divert surplus food away from landfill, and to help support our local food rescue partners to help feed Australians that would otherwise go hungry, is a critical part of our day-to-day operations and support of the community,” said Woolworths head of sustainability Adrian Cullen, describing it as the “first circular economy beer”.

“For every 6 pack of Loafer purchased, you will not only help to put a meal on the table for someone in need, but you will also be enjoying a beer that has helped divert unsold loaves of bread from heading to landfill.”

The beer plan comes as major supermarkets Coles and Woolworths pivot to appeal to more eco-conscious shoppers, with mixed levels of success.

Coles in May introduced its I’m Perfect campaign, which sees fruit and vegetables with imperfections sold at discounted prices to reduce the amount of edible but flawed food being wasted.

According to Harris Farm Markets, around one quarter of Australian produce doesn’t even leave the farm as it’s considered not perfect enough.

And last year, the two supermarkets both pledged to stop using single-use plastic bags at the check-outs. Coles has since claimed its decision has meant 1.7 billion plastic bags have been diverted from landfill.

However, the supermarket giants have also been criticised for their Little Shop and Ooshies campaigns, after the small plastic toys were seen washed up on beaches.

435,Eni CEO: 'You have to give energy but a different kind of energy',"The CEO of Italian oil and gas firm Eni has stressed the importance of both technology and the environment to the energy industry.

Speaking to CNBC's Hadley Gamble and Dan Murphy at the World Energy Congress in Abu Dhabi Monday, Claudio Descalzi was asked whether there were still opportunities to improve the cost-out in the current environment, where Brent is trading at just under $62 a barrel.

""There are more opportunities, clearly now, than before because with the low price all the countries want to attract investors so … they need to invest,"" he said.

Investment was, however, not enough, with Descalzi emphasizing the need for both a strong technological offer and a focus on the environment.

""You have to give energy but a different kind of energy,"" he said, referencing low carbon dioxide energy, the circular economy and hybrid renewables with gas solutions. 



""There are a lot of opportunities because there are different doors that you can open when there is a downturn, but in any case, everybody wants to develop that because we need the energy and … energy consumption is growing, it's not going down."" 



Global energy demand increased by 2.3% in 2018, according to figures from the International Energy Agency earlier this year.

In June 2014, Brent crude hit $115 a barrel before global oversupply saw prices fall. Today, the oil market is facing a resurgent U.S. shale oil industry that continues to add supply to the market. Additionally, geopolitical uncertainties, most notably a protracted trade dispute between the U.S. and China, could upset the demand outlook.

Back on the sustainability front, Eni says it wants zero upstream emissions by the year 2030 and 1.6 gigawatts of renewable energy projects by 2022.

In November 2018, the firm, alongside Algeria's state-owned Sonatrach, inaugurated a 10-megawatt solar plant used to provide clean energy to an oil field in the country.",United States,2019.09
436,Interview with Pure CE Director Theo Measures,"Originally from the UK, I have enjoyed over 8 years of professional experience in the United Arab Emirates as both an entrepreneur & consultant, with a focus on innovative marketing and project management across a wide variety of industries, including Automotive, Security & Risk Management and Film Production; now at the age of 28, culminating in a Directorship with Pure CE, a circular economy focussed private equity firm which undertakes to solve some of the world’s pressing socioeconomic and environmental challenges by creating world-changing businesses that attract private impact investing capital at scale, whilst operating in an ethical and responsible manner.

2) What was your spark, where did it come from?

I have had a growing interest in sustainability for the past 5-6 years; I think for some people, this is part and parcel of growing up and being forced (certainly in my case!) to assume more personal responsibility. I believe that if you are the type of person to enjoy that process and take pride in its outcomes, a natural progression is to investigate how you can further take responsibility for yourself, with regards to how much of a positive impact you are capable of having on the planet, and the people you share it with.

The realization that ’sparked’ my move into the circular economy space was twofold. Firstly, coming to terms with the fact that for environmental sustainability to be remotely possible in any given form, it must be underpinned by financial sustainability; without this, it has no chance of longevity and is therefore by definition, unsustainable. To achieve true success, a sustainable initiative, business, government body or policy must be positively impacting the triple bottom line: People, planet and profit.

Enter Pure CE, and my second realization: operating in the rarefied atmosphere of ‘right people’, ‘right ideas’ and ‘right time’, it is possible to identify and evolve conceptual ideas into globally changing businesses that create a next positive impact, at scale. In short, it is possible!

3) Many perceive sustainability as an uphill struggle. Who or what has helped you most along your journey?

On a personal level, I am buoyed by the growing exposure that environmental issues garner across all forms of media these days. Thankfully, the various algorithms across social media platforms have finally worked out what I am interested in most, which means I am gratefully bombarded each day with news of eco-friendly products, environmental initiative ‘wins’ and a growing sentimentality for the planet in general, as well as being made aware of new issues we collectively face and need to find solutions for.

These all give me energy and inspiration, both in my personal life and in my professional capacity at Pure CE; I am so excited to see how our forthcoming products and services are received on social in the near future, as one of our companies in particular, Purecog, directly addresses the most topical of environmental issues, single-use plastic, in a variety of highly impressive ways. Keep an eye out for them on @purecogofficial!

Furthermore, I am constantly supported and encouraged by my father, close friends and a fantastic set of colleagues – to each of whom I owe sincere and ongoing thanks.

4) How do you deal with challenges?

It of course depends very much on the challenge. We have a tight team here at Pure CE and when we are not in the office, we are regularly enjoying evening dinners, weekend hikes and any other activities that allow us to blow off some steam, strengthen bonds and throw ideas around. It is these interactions, outside of the office, that allow us to communicate, understand and appreciate the challenges that other departments, or team members may be facing. In turn, this means we can confidently ask each other for help, when needed, safe in the knowledge that we understand each other as people, have a desire to help out and are well versed in each other’s objectives within the business.

Outside of work, I try to approach challenges with as much patience, perspective and gratitude as I can muster, whilst trusting in a bigger picture and focussing on the commitment to long term results. In my case at least, these have all helped to make what at times have seemed at first to be insurmountable life challenges, seem more like small bumps in the road.

5) What are your plans for the near-future?

Continue to embrace, with great interest and anticipation, all aspects of the forth industrial revolution and in particular, its potential to add exponential value to circular economies. Further to this, I am always on the look out for new places, people and ideas that allow me to invest myself further into as positive an existence as possible on all fronts.

6) Anything else you would like to add?

I would humbly ask readers to follow Purecog on social media and sign up for our newsletter on our website (www.purecog.com) – we are building its channels as a great source of information and entertainment, with the goal of adding value to all our followers’ daily lives. The channels currently reach around 1 million people per month and every little bit of support the brand gets really helps us, to help our planet. Thank you!",United States,2019.09
438,"Dow, SCG to make recycled, sustainable products","In a far-reaching program, plastics and chemicals giant Dow Inc. will work with industrial firm SCG of Thailand on a range of sustainable products.

Products made by the partnership will include recycled resin, recycled products made from plastic waste, petrochemical feedstocks from plastic waste and renewable plastic resins. The agreement was signed Sept. 6 in Bangkok.

According to officials, the Dow/SCG partnership is based on ""the shared vision to close the loop of plastics waste management for the reduction of plastic leakage to the environment."" It's designed to add value to plastic waste and to prevent them from ending up in the environment, as well as to create a circular economy for plastic in Thailand.

""Our industry and society as a whole must do a better job of capturing and reusing plastic by scaling investments in collection, waste management, recycling technologies and new end markets,"" Dow CEO Jim Fitterling said in a news release. ""Working together with companies like SCG, we can create a world where no plastic ends up in the environment.""

SCG President and CEO Roongrote Rangsiyopash added that working with Midland, Mich.-based Dow ""not only represents our joint commitment in taking action to solve problems through technology and to making real changes, but also provides us with new business opportunity, enhancing sustainability and bringing about practical solutions for recycling and upcycling of plastic waste in Thailand.""

The partnership is aligned with the Thai government's ambition to increase the recycling rate of plastic waste in the country by 2027. Plastic waste in the environment is considered a critical environmental issue where Dow and SCG have innovated in the past. The firms worked together to use materials derived from transformed plastic waste in polymer-modified asphalt roads.

The Dow/SCG effort will add value to low-value or no-value plastic waste, such as multilayer plastics packaging and contaminated plastic waste, officials added.

Dow and SCG are founding members of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, a not-for-profit organization which has pledged $1.5 billion to address the plastic waste issue.

Dow is a major producer of polyethylene resin as well as other specialty plastics and chemicals. The firm employs 37,000 worldwide and had sales of $50 billion in 2018.

Bangkok-based SCG, formerly known as Siam Cement Group, employs 54,000 and has annual sales of around $14 billion. Plastic products made by SCG include PE, PVC and polypropylene resins. The firm's other main business units are cement and packaging.",United States,2019.09

(GC; Bangkok, Thailand; www.pttgcgroup.com) has announced a long-term partnership with ALPLA, a global recycler and high-quality plastic packaging solutions provider. Together, the two companies are revolutionizing the efficient use of renewable resources to ensure they deliver the maximum sustainable benefits. Under the GC and ALPLA partnership, a new joint venture (JV) company called ENVICCO Ltd. has been formed to build a circular plastic resin plant in Asia Industrial Estate in Map Ta Phut, Rayong Province.

Supattanapong Punmeechaow, Chief Executive Officer and President of PTT Global Chemical, said, “The new circular plastic recycling plant is part of our long-term strategic plan that integrates the Circular Economy principles into our business and encourages environmental responsibility by reducing the use of single-use plastics. The new plant is an important milestone as it will create a comprehensive value chain for plastics in Thailand. Under the GC and ALPLA partnership, we are doing a pilot production project to create cooperation in operations with all sectors of society – from beginning, to end in order to apply the Circular Economy principles towards resource efficiency.

EVICCO Limited is established in order to build Thailand’s first plant that will make high-quality recycled PET (rPET) and recycled HDPE (rHDPE) plastic resins.

443,Reliance scouts for startups to give wings to its waste-to-energy plan,"MUMBAI : Reliance Industries is scouting for start-ups—global and domestic—who have cracked a way to treat waste and can help the company further its waste-to-energy and circular economy initiatives.

“We are looking to fund and are scouting around for all technology available for waste segregation, recycling and waste to energy. We are thinking about the bets we should be making in this regard,"" said Vipul Shah, chief operating officer, petrochemicals at RIL.

RIL, one of the largest recyclers of the PET (post-consumer) waste in India, converted about 2 billion waste PET bottles into fabric by 2018. Its current capacity of PET bottle recycling facility is being more than doubled to 5 million bottles in the next few years.

Shah said the firm has reviewed a few hundred applications from startups and is looking at a model that can be replicated.

“People have looked at scalable models but we are looking at what can be replicated. I would rather have four machines to convert waste to energy rather than just one large machine doing the work,"" said Shah.

RIL’s idea is to join hands with a startup and develop the intellectual property that will be owned jointly. “We’d want to give it to the country as a service from our end,"" said Shah.

Environmental damage, particularly to oceans, caused by the sheer volume of waste plastic is one of the pressing concerns facing our planet. Platforms such as Scrapo, the world’s largest plastic recycling marketplace, helps connect waste generators with those who want to recycle it.

Municipalities across India are trying to use technology to measure trash usage, robots that can collect trash and detect and sort items by material type and breakthroughs which will reduce landfill waste by 90%.

RIL said it has developed biodegradable polymers for packaging that perform as well as popular packaging polymers in terms of physical and mechanical properties.

“This development will reduce plastic waste generation and adverse environmental impacts,"" RIL said in its annual report for 2018-19.

Global annual waste generation will grow 70% between 2016 and 2050, the World Bank estimates. A.T. Kearney’s Global Business Policy Council in its predictions for 2019 said food waste still represents the largest share, but the rise of e-commerce is causing an exponential rise in cardboard and other packaging trash.

“In emerging markets, nearly 90% of waste is either openly burned or illegally dumped. And landfills contribute to significant greenhouse gas emissions. Recognition of the global trash crisis is rising, along with efforts to create a circular economy that more efficiently reduces, reuses, and recycles waste,"" AT Kearney said.

RIL has already recycled plastic waste into objects such as spectacles, park benches and fishing nets, and partnered Tetra Pak to run a “Go Green"" initiative.

The company has three plastic-to-roads projects underway on a pilot basis. These initiatives have helped create a solution for the disposal of non-recyclable plastic waste. As a pilot project, 1.2 tonnes of plastic waste has already been used for the construction of 2,600 sq.m of road in Reliance Corporate Park, Navi Mumbai. Further, about 50 tonnes of plastic waste will be used at Nagothane manufacturing division for construction of 40km of road.

In its annual report, RIL said the PET business has involved end consumers in its recycling initiative. It encourages end consumers to deposit empty PET bottles at reverse vending machines installed at Reliance SMART stores, railway stations and various other locations.",United States,2019.09
445,From creating awareness to wearable fabric: How companies are fighting single-use plastic pollution,"Have you ever imagined wearing an ocean-friendly T-shirt made of plastic? When used plastic bottles are washed and chopped into flakes, melted and formed into chips, extruded into yarn and woven into fabric, then dyed, ocean-friendly, wrinkle-free T-shirts are what you get. ‘Raw Cycled’ T-shirts by cold pressed juice brand Raw Pressery is just one of the recent examples where companies are consciously trying to mitigate plastic pollution through upcycling or recycling. In Raw Pressery’s case, turning every seven empty plastic bottles into a wearable apparel has helped them make a “little impact”.

“Our primary goal is to mitigate the amount of plastic which is getting dumped in our wastelands and oceans. Seven Raw Pressery bottles, make one Raw Cycled t-shirt. From the time we started, we have successfully collected 1.2 million bottles. Currently, it’s a drop in the ocean but every little drop counts,” said Atiya Rakyan, ‘chief recycling officer’ of Raw Pressery.

Launched under a collection called Street to Studio, the T-shirts are made of 95 per cent recycled plastic polyester and five per cent synthetic fabric spandex.

Despite plastics being lightweight, versatile and durable and their ubiquitous presence in our daily lives, they are increasingly being seen as a challenge to animals, marine life and future generations.

According to a Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) report, plastic waste generated in India in 2017-18 was a whopping 6,60,787.85 tonnes.

To fight single-use plastic pollution, and go the eco-friendly way, popular brands are opting for measures that align innovation with sustainability. Re-emphasising that everything has value — even plastic — companies are collecting waste from coastal areas and remote islands and coming up with innovative plastic management initiatives.

“The intent is to spread awareness and transform ocean plastic pollution into high-performance sportswear, spinning the problem into a solution, the threat, into a thread,” Sharad Singla, director, brand marketing, Adidas India, told indianexpress.com.

Launched in 2017, Run For The Oceans (RFTO) is a global movement by sportswear brand Adidas and environmental organisation Parley that harnesses the power of sport to draw attention to the devastating levels and impact of marine plastic pollution.

With studies suggesting that one may be eating a credit card’s worth of plastic each week, and companies acknowledging that the use of plastics cannot be done away with, the way ahead lies in looking at useful transformation of plastics.

“We invited the global running community to lace up for the oceans, with Adidas contributing $1 for every kilometre ran between June 8 and 16 in New York (US), Barcelona (Spain) and Shanghai (China). The movement witnessed an overall participation of 87,490 individuals running on the Runtastic app, clocking a total of 1,75,060.81 kms and clearing over 238 tonnes of plastic waste manually as part of the beach clean-up drives, plogging efforts in Delhi, and boats running in mangroves of Mumbai. The waste was then transported to an Adidas supplier who then produced the yarn,” explained Singla.

In 2018, Adidas produced more than five million pairs of running shoes made from plastic. These contained 95 per cent post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastics sourced from ocean and beach clean-ups. The shoes produced were Alphabounce Parley for Rs 9,999 and Alphaboost Parley for Rs 14,999.

A 2017 PwC-Assocham study indicated that owing to poor waste management practices, a staggering 88 square kms of land — nearly equal to the area under the administration of New Delhi Municipal Council — will have to be dedicated for waste disposal through landfilling by 2050.

Valuing plastic means treating it responsibly so that it can be reused and recycled, and does not end up in our oceans and landfills, asserted Antara Kundu, marketing head, The Body Shop – Asia South. “Not using plastic is not the only answer. If used responsibly it can be sustainable, so we need to show love for the plastic that we do use,” she said.

Since an abundant resource of recyclable plastic already exists, The Body Shop uses Community Trade (CT) recycled plastic from Bengaluru, with the help of social organisations such as Plastics For Change and Hasiru Dala.

“This not only helps tackle the existing problem, it will also help to empower the waste pickers we support in Bengaluru with access to more sanitary working conditions, a fair price and the respect and recognition they deserve,” explained Kundu.

“Our 250ml haircare bottles are now made of CT Recycled Plastic and we aim to scale this up in the future. In the long run, we aim to become completely closed loop which means we will repurpose all our plastic back into our packaging or for use in our shop fixtures,” she added.

REFASH, one of the first global upcycled fashion platform started in 2018, curated Mumbai’s first week-long exhibit of upcycling designers in August this year. As part of REFASH Pop Up, many activities were conducted in the form of ‘mending’ workshops, ‘repair’ events and talks to initiate conversations around upcycling. Besides that, the event showcased some creative upcycling designers such as I was a Sari, Inai, Iro Iro, The loom art among others.

The founder Akanksha Kaila Akashi said, “Upcycling is not a new concept in India. It has been present in our Indian households for generations – only the term is new. Our vision with the REFASH Pop Up is to give a platform to young Indian designers and brands who are re-looking at waste and designing products that are unique and helping in achieving a circular economy.”

To tackle the growing amounts of plastic waste in both urban and rural areas, the Government of India issued the Plastic Waste Management Rules in 2016. A core feature of it is the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), which mandates producers to establish collection systems for generated waste in close collaboration with state urban development departments.

In tune with the EPR and their “global commitment” of making plastic reusable or recyclable by 2025 and achieving plastic neutrality, Nestle India has stepped up initiatives towards plastic waste management through conducting various pilot projects. “Our vision is that none of our packaging, including plastics, ends up in landfill or as litter. We work with Producer Responsibility Organisations (PROs) to create awareness amongst waste pickers to collect, segregate, recycle and responsibly dispose post-consumer plastic waste by sending it to waste-to-energy plants and cement kilns,” Sanjay Khajuria, director, corporate affairs, Nestlé India told indianexpress.com.

Back in 2018, Nestlé India worked in 12 states as part of EPR and extended the implementation of pilots to 20 states in 2019 including Bihar, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Goa, Gujarat and Maharashtra.

Companies state that a circular economy fuelled by ‘reduce-recover-reuse-recycle-redesign-re-manufacture’ approach rather than ‘produce-consume-dispose’ led linear economy approach is far more “regenerative and restorative in nature”.

“The usage of plastic cannot be stopped by companies and industries entirely since it is reasonable, flexible, and sturdy. However, they can be recycled into many products like kitchenware, clothing, and carpets, and in turn, be sold in the market. Not only does this lead to environmental conservation, but also a circular economy,” explained Rakyan.

450,Taking Stock Of The Role Private Equity Will Play In The Fourth Industrial Revolution,"The product of the Industrial Revolution was an unprecedented explosion in human ingenuity, improved living standards, and capital accumulation around the world. Driven by a blend of the emergence of intellectual property rights with a generation of tinkerers and hobbyists, what originated with the introduction of steam power manifested itself with Abraham Lincoln’s famous words inscribed on the Herbert C. Hoover Building’s north entrance in Washington DC:

“The patent system added the fuel of interest to the fire of genius.”

Since the harnessing of steam power and the subsequent two centuries of human innovation that have followed, we are on the precipice of entering what has been hailed as the Fourth Industrial Revolution. At the paradoxical crossroads of our own ingenuity competing with its adverse consequences on our climate, the goal has become to transition to a circular economy -- circumventing the traditional linear economy born of the Industrial Revolution’s “make, take, and dispose” model in the process.

At the core of the push into the next wave of industrial innovation is a premium placed on sustainability, and how to wield the resources and knowledge at our disposal to not just expand our technological capacity, but do so efficiently. “Sustainability is not about saving resources,” said Paul Gandy, Managing Director of Private Equity Firm Pure CE. “Instead, the strategy is to use available resources in a smarter way, focusing on identifying and evolving conceptual ideas in the right areas.” Pure CE’s vision mirrors broader sentiment by the global community and is expounded by the firm’s continual emphasis on the world’s “Triple Bottom Line”: people, planet, profit. In an age where AI, efficient biofuels, 3D printing, and new supermolecules linger just over the horizon, the tools for achieving a sustainable and automated future are at our fingertips. And private equity firms, historically and now, play a pivotal role in fueling our trajectory towards those goals.

A read through The Most Powerful Idea in The World by William Rosen or other detailed accounts of the 18th-century industrial scene in Great Britain expose just how powerful of an incentive profit-seeking is, and its primary role in originating what would become known as one of the most significant events in human history. Whether that profit was purely financially-motivated, or more altruistic in nature, as expressed in the words of James Watt, “It is not worth my while to manufacture in three countries only; but I can find it very worthwhile to make it for the whole world,” it is evident that long time horizons are inextricably correlated to wealth-generation.

Those early cliques of steam engineers, hobbyists, and tinkerers were either entirely self-funded through profits made from their patented inventions or financially supported by investors with capital at their disposal. In the case of the latter, the early profiteers of steam power’s collateral benefits (i.e., textile manufacturing, trains, industrial shipping, etc.) would seed the origins of a profound generation of what we recognize today as private equity. Capital investors heaping sums into private firms, leveraged buyouts of public companies, and providing the financial support that allowed entrepreneurs and inventors to flourish became the standard for successful capitalist economies -- most recently concluding with perhaps their most impressive feat yet: the blossoming of a digital age.

Private equity firms are largely credited as an integral component of the technological innovation that underscored American progress in the early 1970s to the early 2000s.

Once venture capital began bankrolling the early iteration of Silicon Valley in the 1970s, with the likes of Apple under that umbrella, it became clear that many startups preferred private equity over high-pressure public company models heavily reliant on meeting quarterly investor demands. With private equity, entrepreneurs could be more creative and focus on developing their product or service, while seed investors could reap huge gains once a successful startup IPO’d, even if it took years to unfold. Naturally, the result was more conducive to mass-adoption of consumer-facing hardware products and software applications, underscored by the rise of tech giants like Facebook and Google today alongside mainstay powerhouses such as Intel and Apple.

However, parallel to such a rapid technological advance has come some negative consequences of the social and environmental variety. Despite widespread efficiency gains afforded by the reduced communication overhead and improved information dispersion of the Internet, subtle political and social effects as outlays of social media are snowballing, and we have still yet to fully surpass that reliance on the linear economy model in the fires of industry. “Every business has an impact on society by the way they deliver their products and services,” said Mr. Gandy. “Whereas previous iterations of private equity focused primarily on generating profits, awareness of how we achieve our end goals as a company is increasing.” For their part, Pure CE views honing in on specific industries as the optimal method to blend profit-seeking and wealth generation with environmental sustainability and technological refinement. However, you will notice that profits are always correlated with progress, and our efforts preceding the Fourth Industrial Revolution, while more nuanced, will inevitably be conditioned by the desire to generate wealth.

Pure CE views several areas as having the best return for positively impacting the “Triple Bottom Line” of the world.

“Advocating for the transition to a circular economy, the idea is to create a regenerative economic model where we can rebuild capital -- whether that be financial, manufactured, social, or natural,” said Mr. Gandy. “We specialize in recycling, oil and gas, biomedical, renewables, and smart infrastructure because we see those areas as ideal convergence points with emerging technologies.” Many firms may publicly state support for sustainability with catchy PR campaigns today, but as Nassim Taleb said: “Don’t tell me what you think; just show me what’s in your portfolio.” To highlight the type of private equity (PE) development that Pure CE identifies with, along with many other PE firms, it's best to take a look inside their portfolio. “Sustainable companies that offer a tangible solution to major problems, like plastic recycling appear poised to become the most successful in the next technological revolution,” said Pure CE Marketing Director, Theo Measures.

One of Pure CE’s portfolio companies is Purecog, a multi-pronged sustainable technology company with several commercially viable initiatives including a single-use, biodegradable and water-soluble plastic replacement product, a form of renewable energy called ocean thermal exchange technology and two (self-powered) waste to energy solutions; one converting plastic back into oil and the other turning even the most hazardous of waste into usable gas fuels. Purecog’s goal is a multi-industry initiative to minimize waste, fostering the type of regenerative resource management ideally underlying a circular economy.

“Since the 1950s, around 8bn tons of plastic (that's 800,000 Eiffel Towers) has been produced, only 9% of which has been recycled. It's easy to see how this figure has accumulated, with 2m plastic bags and 1m plastic bottles bought and used around the world, every single minute,” detailed Mr. Measures “It is statistics like these, which led to an overwhelming vote by members of the European Parliament, to ban all single-use plastics in Europe, by 2021.”

The ocean plastic problem is well-documented, and it is promising to see so much innovation around the issue develop, even outside of Purecog. But the broader push into the Fourth Industrial Revolution doesn’t just start and end with recycling -- industrial efficiency is the name of the game.

Other initiatives at the edge of regenerative, sustainable technical solutions harness newly developed methods for more efficient extraction of oil and natural gases, which has an important impact on the green energy initiatives and understanding the long-term trajectory of energy production. For example, advances in oil sampling from another Pure CE brand, Peregrine Analytics, enables unique, real-time snapshot fingerprinting of the chemical constituents in oil pipelines, maximizing efficiency and reducing the risk of negative environmental impact. Peregrine technology can also be applied to the analysis of blood and water, while R&D continues on the fingerprinting potential for other substances. Similar initiatives to produce cleaner energy include the development of biofuels from algae and ongoing theoretical research into the eventuality of fusion energy.

The First Industrial Revolution was born with the concept of vastly increasing energy output at lower costs, not the reverse. And successful innovation is typically a random confluence of capital and entrepreneurship meeting opportunity in a certain market, usually not the product of forcefulness in the desired situation. Regardless, at the core of these epochs of technological advancement will continue to be what Abraham Lincoln articulated so well all those years ago.

Thanks to technology, we can now shop for almost anything online, 24/7: and it will be delivered right to your doorstep.

We love to shop for clothes more than anything else. We now consume about 80 billion new pieces of clothing collectively every year, which is 400 percent more than the amount we consumed just around two decades ago. While we enjoy the convenience, we often overlook the environmental impact of our impulse purchases of something we’ll probably only wear once.

Fashion waste is reaching a tipping point. It is the second-largest polluter in the world, just behind oil, and is not sustainable.

The fashion industry realizes this detrimental effect and ways to address the issue are evolving from within the industry. A significant driver was the signing of the U.N. Climate Change’s Fashion Industry Charter in late 2018. Forty-three leading fashion brands, including Adidas, Burberry and Hugo Boss, retailers, suppliers and other companies, committed to work together to address the climate impact of fashion across its entire supply chain.

Industry players are launching initiatives to better drive sustainability and promote a circular economy ecosystem in their supply chain, whereby resources are kept in use for as long as possible. The idea is to recover and regenerate products and materials at the end of each service life. Sustainability is now one of the most important goals in the fashion industry for manufacturers, suppliers and brands as they gear toward more eco-friendly fibers and production methods.

Sustainable fashion has become an emerging trend. Environmentally friendly clothing is increasingly considered trendy. Online searches for sustainable fashion have had an upsurge: According to Forbes, Lyst has reported a 47 percent increase in shoppers looking for items that have ethical and style credentials with terms such as “vegan leather” and “organic cotton.” Several brands that have a strong stance on sustainability made the “most searched for” roundup for the first time. Consumers are more eco-conscious, and they want their purchases to reflect their values.

Zara, Levi’s, Stella McCartney and Mara Hoffman are just some of the fashion brands starting to emphasize eco-friendly fashion in their collections. In 2016, Zara incorporated Tencel branded lyocell fibers in its “Join Life” eco-collection to provide consumers with sustainable alternatives. Early this year, U.S.-based designer Mara Hoffman received the “Leading the Change Award” during a New York Fashion Week event as a recognition of her sustainable initiatives with her namesake label. To drive the circular economy, Mara Hoffman has partnered with Lenzing to incorporate sustainably sourced plant-based cellulosic fibers into its collections.

Certified as compostable and biodegradable, the fibers are produced in a closed-loop production process and can fully revert back to nature. Often, “it takes a village to raise a child,” and, likewise, for building an eco-friendly environment. It is important for all industry players to work together to drive eco-responsible practices and to ensure a sustainable development of the textile and fashion industry in the long run.

It has also become apparent that for the fashion industry to flourish in the future, it must redesign business and innovation models in order to create better economic, environmental and societal outcomes. Brands need to think about how to shift from the “take-make-waste” model that characterizes fashion today by embracing circular economy principles. Preserving the environment cannot be done alone; it requires a combined effort from everyone.

While the textile industry is gearing towards improving its production processes and supply chain transparency, as consumers, we can all also contribute in this “sustainability relay” by changing our consumption habits and stepping up to “green up” our wardrobe.

One way to start, is by learning how to read clothing care labels and learn about the raw materials our clothes are made of. Each component — whether it’s synthetic fibers, polyester or nylon — has a different impact on the environment. By learning more, we can develop better judgments on how eco-friendly clothing [truly] is. Once there is greater understanding about fabric [blends and origins], start to shop for eco-friendly brands. When shopping, always ask yourself, “Is this sustainable or not? Is it a must-have purchase? Do I need it?”

To make sustainable shopping decisions, bear in mind [the importance of] sustainable fibers. Innovation has allowed a wide variety of materials to be used in making clothing, such as wood-based fibers, hemp and lotus, and even your breakfast staples, such as coffee and bananas, which also make great textiles fibers.

Another tip is to learn the right way to dispose of your clothes: Can you find a way for them to enter the circular economy? Consider donating them to local charities, sell to a vintage store or even do-it-yourself clothing to give it a new lease of life. We can also take better care of clothing to increase its useful life. Lastly, spread the word to your friends. Get them inspired and motivate them to join in the eco-movement and do good together.

All phases along a product’s life cycle are interlinked. Every subtle action, be it the efforts from manufacturers, brands or consumers, can ultimately have a significant impact on the environment. As an advocate of sustainability, Lenzing is supporting the #Make It Feel Right campaign to raise consumer awareness on the meaningful impacts we can make by choosing eco-fashion products. Let us all take part in this meaningful movement for sustainable fashion and do what is right for our planet.

452,Struggling media could get lift from Competition Bureau digital review: group,"Facebook, one of the biggest players in the space, said in a statement that it was committed to working with and being accountable to governments across the world. Google, another giant of the space, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Local advertising once paid for local news production, said Hinds, but since the entrance of Google and Facebook around the new millennium that circular economy broke.

“The traditional advertising market has been totally decimated by the rise of the digital players.”

About $6.8 billion in advertising dollars in 2017 went to Facebook and Google, according to the Canadian Media Concentration Research Project’s most recent report. That’s out of a total $13.8 billion spent across all commercial media, the report found, adding the two tech titans are carving out an enormous role in a shrinking advertising market.

The companies benefit from a tax system that advantages foreign suppliers, said Hinds. When companies purchase an advertisement in a local paper, they pay a tax, he said, but that doesn’t apply when they advertise products or services on digital platforms.

Current regulations also allow news aggregators, like Google, to take parts of articles produced by other organizations without payment and repurpose them, he said.

Canadian media struggled to adapt to this changing landscape with major newspapers seeing revenues slip and carrying out mass layoffs.

Since 2008, 235 local media outlets closed with a further 46 shuttering as a result of mergers, according to the Local News Research Project’s August report. Meanwhile, only 94 new local outlets opened, with 17 more produced through mergers during that same time.

Phillip Crawley, Globe and Mail publisher and CEO, welcomed the review in a statement.

“We believe that a review would be an important first step in ensuring there is healthy competition in digital markets. Other jurisdictions like the EU and Australia have already started looking at the practices of dominant digital players, so it is right for Canada to follow suit. “

Torstar Corp. and Postmedia Network Inc. did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Hinds hopes the call for information leads to a broader investigation that could eventually create regulatory or legislative change.

He points to an inquiry by the bureau’s Australian counterpart that examined the impact of digital companies, predominantly Google and Facebook, on advertisers, media and consumers as a good example for how to tackle the problem.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission released a more than 600-page report in June with 23 recommendations that included developing and implementing a platform-neutral regulatory framework for all companies that produce or deliver content in the country, and providing stable and adequate funding for public broadcasters.

“They’ve come out with some very, very solid recommendations and a pathway to a new model,” said Hinds, adding he thinks there’s an opportunity for Canada to do the same.

But that’s not necessarily what the Competition Bureau plans.

The information gathered could lead to investigations, said Brad Callaghan, an assistant deputy commissioner at the bureau.

Those investigations would be carried out confidentially, he said, and it doesn’t intend to publish a report similar to the Australian one.

The bureau can’t comment on whether any of its possible investigations could lead to broader changes, he said, adding its work is investigative and enforcement oriented.

Callaghan couldn’t say whether the public consultation would benefit traditional media companies.

“Our work is really based on the information that’s available to us and it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to predict the way that something would play out down the road,” he said.

However, should the bureau find any evidence of wrongdoing, it wouldn’t hesitate to take action, which could mean bringing a case before the Competition Tribunal.

That process could be lengthy as the public consultation ends November 30 — though the bureau notes it’s always open to hearing from people or businesses.

And while the process is now underway, Canada still lags well behind other countries, said Christopher Waddell, program director for Carleton University’s bachelor of media production and design program.

“It feels like we’re about four or five years behind the rest of the world.”

The European Union has been exploring this issue for a long time, he said, dating back to a case that began in the late 1990s against Microsoft. The case concluded in late 2009 with Microsoft agreeing to give users a choice of which web browser to use rather than requiring them to use its Internet Explorer browser, and paying more than a billion pounds in fines.

The European Commission also recently announced it opened a formal antitrust investigation into Amazon, while the U.S. Department of Justice has opened one into major online platforms.

“They’ve been going on in other places for a long time,” said Waddell. “We don’t seem to have caught on to the potential anti-competitive practices that may exist until, I guess, now.”",United States,2019.09
454,Mespack Partners with Dow to develop fully recyclable flexible packaging solutions,"This collaboration allows the development and commercialization of pouches made of mono-material films, permitting converters and brand owners to meet their sustainability commitments of increasing recyclability of flexible packaging. This solution will be on display at PACK EXPO Las Vegas in Mespack’s Booth C-4118.

Dow will showcase Mespack’s hf/f/s machine at its Freeport, TX, location of Pack Studios, where the line will help accelerate and support projects for recyclable stand-up pouches with customers and brand owners in North America. With 86 billion stand-up pouches produced every year, this new recyclable flexible packaging solution is an on-trend, customer-driven innovation that will play a key role in the circular economy. The technology map for the recyclable pouch covers applications from baby food, condiments, detergents, shampoos, body lotions, and more.

“It is important to Mespack that we support our customers in the adoption of recyclable, compostable, and biodegradable materials to the flexible packaging industry, which is why we are so excited about this collaboration,” Guillem Clofent, Managing Director for Mespack said. “Mespack has a strong drive to reverse the environmental impact plastics and other non-biodegradable materials have on our planet. By partnering with leaders like Dow, Menshen, Velcro, and Venvirotech we hope to create a revolution in packaging sustainability.”

Dow Pack Studios brings together leading equipment manufacturers, packaging designers and prototyping specialists in order to quickly and efficiently drive the commercialization of new and improved packaging innovations. Mespack’s 180 FE hf/f/s machine will be installed at the Freeport Pack Studio in the first quarter of 2020, where it will be ready to test customer film and showcase the environmentally friendly solution.

“The wonderful thing about this solution is that with the appropriate engineering, our installed base of equipment can be retrofitted to utilize this new recyclable material,” said Santi Alberich, marketing manager for Mespack. “Every day another CPG company is committing to utilizing 100% recyclable material. We love that we are helping our customers and the environment at the same time.”",United States,2019.09
456,Book your passage to a European design fair,"Bodkins to Brexit. Avoid the angry crowds in Parliament Square and escape instead to a world where soft furnishings trump hard borders. Apart from the scenes around Westminster, which look increasingly like a Breughel, you’ll find the entire city turned into an enormous gallery for the London Design Festival – taking place from September 14th to 22nd.

It’s packed with pop-up venues featuring dynamic and innovative design projects and last year attracted more than half a million visitors from more than 75 countries. Lord knows how many will be allowed in next year so maybe now’s the time to go.

Much of it is based around London’s Victoria & Albert Museum, that august repository of art and design, which is home to everything from ancient Chinese ceramics to Mary Quant miniskirts.

Since its launch in 2007, the festival has commissioned celebrated designers to create sensational temporary structures. The first was Zaha Hadid’s Urban Nebula, a polished concrete snakelike bench erected at the Southbank Centre.

There’s more seating this year, with British designer Paul Cocksedge’s Please Be Seated, a series of concentric circular benches you walk under to sit on at Finsbury Avenue Square. Expect even more benches, and cartoonish street furniture, at Walala Lounge, Camille Walala’s installation at South Molton Street in the West End.

If you’re as happy to listen as to look, check out the programme at the Global Design Forum, taking place at the V&A throughout the festival and including a series of ticketed talks, workshops and debates.

Headliners include Japanese architect Kengo Kuma; fashion maverick Vivienne Westwood and graphic designer Astrid Stavro. And don’t miss Sam Jacob’s Sea Things, which explores the challenges of plastic in today’s world.

Get your house in order in Paris

Beg, borrow or steal (okay don’t steal) a ticket for Maison et Objet, Paris’s international trade fair for interiors professionals. The mammoth trade-only event is dedicated to lifestyle, decoration and design, and takes place twice yearly, in January and September, in the mammoth Parc des Expositions at Nord Villepinte.

It runs until September 10th, so you’ll need to be quick, but make sure to put in the groundwork first. With upwards of 3,000 exhibitors from all corners of the globe, you’re going to need to plan your visit with military precision.

This season’s Maison et Objet pilgrimage coincides nicely with Paris Design Week (through September 14th) so, even if you can’t get yourself a professional accreditation to get into the exhibition, you can still enjoy one of the world’s biggest design gatherings, with a programme of events aimed at interested amateurs as much as international professionals. Of particular interest is Le Off, its exhibition showcasing new design talent.

Paris Design Week is famous for its “promenades” – themed tours entitled “art & design”, “upcycling” and “work!”, the last of which brings together new ideas about shared workspaces. “Projet” is a tour of interior design professionals, while ‘savoir-faire’ is all about craft. There’s a “food design” tour as well, taking in restaurant concepts and stores specialising in the culinary arts.

Head to Helsinki for Habitare (September 11th to 15th) the largest furniture, design and interior decor event in Finland. Last year, 56,000 people visited the expo, which focuses on young designers in particular.

The theme this year is “Mindspaces”, so expect lots of multi-sensory experiences. Participants will also explore the nexus between reality and augmented reality, and tease out issues around privacy, the circular economy and happiness.

The design fair coincides with Helsinki Design Week, the largest design festival in any of the Nordic countries. Some 170,000 visitors attended last year to explore fashion, architecture and urban culture.

The festival offers 250 events, including ones for both design professionals and the general public. It also includes Children’s Design Week. Events take place in museums, markets, seminar halls and “secret” shops, so it’s a great way to explore the city too.

Among the highlights this year is The Value of Clothing, an interactive fashion installation consisting of wearable pieces of art created by Dusty Marjut Uotila, which visitors can borrow. The aim of the exercise is to open up a greater understanding both of the process of making a garment and its real value.

Helsinki Design Week includes sustainable packaging projects too, looking at the urgent need to develop alternatives to oil-based materials such as polystyrene, as well as new ways of reducing wood waste in construction.

Keep it lit in Valencia

Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences put what was something of a Spanish backwater firmly on the tourist map when launched in the late 1990s and early noughties. It has stayed there pretty much ever since, with Calatrava and Candela’s futuristic designs – an architectural complex that includes a giant aquarium, science museum and concert hall – in themselves reason enough to go.

Feria Habitat Valencia, the city’s International Fair of Furniture and Lighting, simply provides fresh impetus. It takes place from Tuesday to Friday, September 17th to 20th, at the city’s main convention centre and attracts more than 400 exhibitors. These span furniture, lighting, ceramics, textiles, kitchen design, home tech products and garden accessories.

If high fashion and cutting-edge design leave you feeling low and dull, make a beeline to Brussels instead. Brussels Design Market ( September 28th and 29th) is the largest vintage design market in Europe. Founded 15 years ago as a simple flea market, it has grown in size and stature, and is still devoted to furnishings made between the 1950s and 1980s. Once over the shock of realising that the 1980s qualifies as vintage, which means it’s well on its way to antique, you can embrace the nostalgia fest twice yearly – it’s on in spring too.

About 100 exhibitors and more than 7,000 visitors typically attend each event, which takes place in Sheds 3 and 4 of Tour & Taxis, Belgium’s best known venue. The fair is home to an eclectic mix of goods, with stall holders coming from across Europe and the UK.

Expect lots of ceramics, glass, metal, wood and Bakelite collectables, plus opportunities for iconic finds such as Pierre Paulin ribbon chairs and Frank Reenskaug rocking chairs. Shed 4 is the Expo Shed, where exhibitors set up full-scale showrooms. Shed 3 is a good old fashioned “brocante”. Both fill up with dealers, collectors and design enthusiasts as the entire event is a 20th-century treasure.",United States,2019.09
458,Majority of CEOs now focus on sustainability – survey,"Majority (80%) of the Chief Executive Officer (CEOs) expect to change their production/service model in the next three to five years to promote more sustainable practices.

This shift in focus towards sustainability surfaced as Isla Lipana & Co./PwC Philippines (PwC), in the PwC MAP 2019 CEO Survey, asked the CEOs about their views on sustainability and the changes that they need to make to address the issues that we are facing.

The survey, conducted by PwC for the 17th MAP (Management Association of the Philippines) International CEO Conference that will be held on 10 September 2019 at the Makati Shangri-La Hotel, reflects the conference’s theme, “The Future of Business: Sustainability. Development. Impact.”

MAP President Riza Mantaring said that the conference “focuses on the playing ground for competitiveness and sustainability in the future, which is in the arena of doing good, not just looking good; in purpose, not just profits; in driving social change, not just shareholder value.”

Atty. Alexander Cabrera, PwC Philippines’ Chairman and Senior Partner, expressed optimism as the number of CEOs who use sustainable practices in the companies is on the rise.

“While most are still using the traditional practices related to energy use and recycling, a good number have plans of shifting to a circular business model as profitability and sustainability are no longer mutually exclusive,” he said.

“A profitable business is not necessarily good business if it does not lead to ‘good’ growth, which is sustainable and empathetic.”

He urged that sustainability should be embedded in all of business activities and decisions.

While majority of the CEOs fully support sustainable business practices, they identified high transition costs, inadequate technology, and economic viability as the main factors that are preventing them from fully adopting sustainable practices.

Benjamin Azada, PwC Philippines’ Consulting Managing Principal, admitted: “Transitioning to a circular model brings in costs related to management, research and development, and infrastructure. Our business leaders, however, should realize that the circular economy is a long-term strategy that helps address the serious environmental and business risks that we are facing.”",United States,2019.09
462,I Wear This Dress Trend at Least 3 Times a Week,"The item that takes up the most space in my wardrobe (outside of a ridiculous shoe collection)? Printed dresses. But not just any old printed dress can slide past the uptight bouncer on the door—they have to be inspired by vintage shapes and patterns. My back catalogue includes a mix of new and old, and I definitely have enough for every day of the week (maybe even a fortnight or quarter), so it's rare to see me in wearing anything but a patterned midi.

Although there's little I enjoy more than a rummage around a thrift store, I've found that for ease—and that covers everything from fit to washing requirements or time spent searching and mending—it's good to be able to lean upon a range of dress-heavy brands that actually specialise in vintage-look styles.

Owning the ""real deal"" when it comes to '60s and '70s garms will always be the preference, and I'm a strong supporter of the circular economy, but there are other benefits to buying a more recent creation: For one, fabric development has moved on, and sometimes I'd rather buy a piece that isn't rendered in nylon (which can feel unbreathable or smell like it's never quite laundered someone else's sweatiest day away).

This ""vintage but new"" category has become something of a successful niche over the past few years. Just think of all of the booming brands women like me go to for this kind of flattering, timeless dress: Rixo, Réalisation and Ghost are just a few names enjoying an extended period in the fashion spotlight.

Keep scrolling to see the best vintage-inspired dress brands, who is wearing them and the loveliest styles to invest in now.

466,Researcher: Bio-based materials can help with ‘bad image’ of plastics,"In preparation for the world’s leading plastics show in October — K 2019 — the German mechanical engineering association (VDMA) is featuring a series of interviews with officials within its plastics and rubber division as well as its key members.

In an interview, Hans-Josef Endres, head of IKK Institute for Plastics and Circular Economy at Leibniz University of Hanover discussed the “bad image” of plastics, saying bioplastics could potentially help restore the image.

“Bio-based plastics are climate-neutral as each plant absorbs as much CO2 in its lifetime as it emits when it is burned or it decomposes,” he said.

With more than 230 members from Germany, Austria, Switzerland and France, VDMA will be centring its focus on circular economy and closed loop concepts during K 2019, in Düsseldorf, Germany, Oct. 16-22.

Q: Plastics have a bad image. Can bioplastics contribute to changing attitudes?

Endres: Bioplastics can have an impact on the image because they have advantages as regards the raw material as well as their disposal. Plastics have their bad image not only because they are related to petrochemistry, but also on account of their longevity. From the product point of view this is an advantage, but in terms of waste it is seen as a drawback. In truth, the situation of bioplastics is no better. On the contrary: In the public, the negative image of petrol-based plastics is often transferred to bioplastics, although they have advantages as they are compostable and also recyclable. Consumers do not differentiate.

Q: But bio-based plastics are criticized because they use up food resources, correct?

Endres: This criticism is too sweeping. The greenhouse effect also consumes acreage, and renewable raw materials are also used in the energy sector. Moreover, when we talk about raw materials for bio-based plastics we do not only mean those that are the basis for food but also cotton, rubber or linoleum as well as increasingly agricultural waste materials. But let’s set that aside for the moment. If you manufactured the 350 million tonnes of plastics produced every year completely from bio-based materials, you would need about 5 percent of the available acreage.

Q: There are bio-based plastics and bio-degradable plastics. Which are better?

Endres: It depends on their application. Bio-based describes only the origin of the raw material used to produce the polymer. Plastics are bio-degradable when microorganisms can metabolize the polymer structure in biological processes, completely independently of the raw material origin. For example, you can also make biodegradable plastics from crude oil and durable plastics from renewable raw materials. The very first plastics people made were all bio-based because back then we did not have crude oil.

Q: Why should you produce bio-based plastics if it is not biodegradable?

Endres: One might also ask why produce bio-based plastics if you can make them petrochemically? The benefit is a reduction in CO2. Every plastic material is disposed of at the end of its useful life — by burning or, in case of many bio plastics, by composting. Bio-based plastics are climate-neutral as each plant absorbs as much CO2 in its lifetime as it emits when it is burned or it decomposes. In addition, the demand for plastics is rising. Soon we will no longer need 5 but perhaps 10 percent of the crude oil reserves to produce plastics. For this reason, the mineral oil industry could more easily do without the plastics industry as a customer than vice versa; at present plastics still need petrochemical raw materials.

Q: What is the current focus in the research of bioplastics?

Endres: A major research area is the development of so-called drop-ins. These are bio-based plastics which are identical in structure with their petrochemical counterparts, for example, polyethylene or PET made from bio-alcohol. Technically they offer the same properties as conventional plastics but ecologically they are better as they are bio-based, that means renewable.

Q: In their plastics strategy, the EU focuses on recycling. Is that a problem for bioplastics?

Endres: Bioplastics can also be separated in the waste stream, recycled and made into new products. If they are composted or even burned, it is still natural recycling of the carbon by means of photosynthesis. When we recycle petrochemical plastics, the carbon is recycled technically. Drop-ins can also be recycled easily together with their petrochemical counterparts. Apart from this we have novel bioplastics, such as PLA. PLA must — just like any other plastics material — be separated from the waste stream. That means recyclability depends on the amount of available material. PLA is easily identifiably in the waste stream; it can be recycled, but due to the small amount it is currently not worthwhile to include a special sorting stage for PLA.

Recycling of PET, for example, only developed with the rising amount of PET.

Q: Research is also taking place in the field of biocomposites. What is their advantage over other material composites?

Endres: The case of carbon fibers shows the dilemma of composite materials. Carbon fiber composites [CFC] has been optimized over many years, but researchers did not take into account the end of the life cycle. Carbon fiber materials have very good performance characteristics, but it is difficult to dispose of them. In addition, the production of carbon fibers is very energy intensive. A car made of CFC components weighs clearly less and consequently consumes less fuel or energy. But the car needs to drive 150,000 kilometers for the CO2 resulting in its production to be offset. In the case of CFC the environmental pollution is shifted to the phase of fiber production and its unresolved disposal. This is where the advantages of biocomposites come in. They are also suited to produce lightweight materials. But here we have a material component with a bio-based raw material origin. At the same time, a natural fibre can be burned much more easily, CO2 neutrally. At the end of its life cycle the situation is much better than in the case of carbon fibres.

Q: What is your view of German circular economy in the international context?​​​​​​​

Endres: Several countries are moving in the same direction. Canada, for example, is also increasingly geared towards circular economy and wants to reduce the multitude of approved packaging plastics. But there, waste disposal logistics systems have not yet been properly established. In some Asian countries, awareness of circular economy is also rising. However, in the U.S. most plastic waste is dumped. Some European countries including Germany have a certain pioneering role in the field of recycling of plastics packaging. Germany already introduced dual systems more than 20 years ago. Germany has a technological edge in this field but has so far not really made use of it. Only now, with growing political and public pressure is the sector coming to life.",United States,2019.09

469,How synthetic biology can help build sustainable cities | Greenbiz,"Sustainability is in vogue, with businesses and cities jostling to improve their public image and produce goods and services using renewable sources. Yet cities exponentially swell and carbon emissions continue to increase. Global CO2 emissions rise nearly every year (about 36 billion tons in 2014), with the bulk of these derived from solid and liquid fuels.

Scientific and economic solutions to curtail these emissions have been proposed for decades, with some success along the way. But 21st century problems necessitate modern solutions, and businesses — the major contributors to carbon emissions — are not typically willing to promote sustainability at the cost of profits.

Fortunately, synthetic biology — an engineering approach to biology that creates and uses tools to design and build functions in cells — offers a means to implement sustainable manufacturing processes that can reduce costs while producing materials, fuels and chemicals that are superior to existing products on the market.

The engineering and adaptability of genetically modified organisms holds the solution.

In 2000, two research letters appeared back-to-back in the journal Nature. Confined to the final pages of the January issue, they heralded a paradigm shift in biology.

In these letters, scientists reported the first successful genetic circuits operating in living cells. Modeled on electrical circuits, the scientists constructed two types of biological circuits in living organisms using entirely synthetic DNA, programming the cell to perform predefined behaviors not found in nature.

While synthetic biology has come a long way in the last two decades, its greatest test, industrial scale manufacturing for a circular and sustainable economy, is only just beginning. A skilled group of physicists, bioengineers and molecular biologists soon flocked to the discipline, eager to program cells that could perform untapped functions. In the years that followed, engineered cells were processing and recording information, executing complex behaviors (such as counting and forming patterns) and converting cheap starting materials into valuable compounds and medicines.

In April, the field of synthetic biology graced the cover of The Economist, broadly conveying both its promise and perils. While synthetic biology has come a long way in the last two decades, its greatest test, industrial scale manufacturing for a circular and sustainable economy, is only just beginning.

Humans have exploited microbes for thousands of years. By supplying bacteria and yeast with simple sugars, they have long produced tasty foods such as bread, wine, beer and cheese.

But synthetic biologists are rerouting the metabolic pathways of these same organisms so that they consume carbon waste, such as carbon dioxide and methane, rather than sugar. By changing their food supply, the cells still can produce a repertoire of products, albeit with less waste and expense.

Some industrial cities, mainly in Asia, already take carbon dioxide and methane waste from factories and use it as a feedstock to manufacture a milieu of commercial products. Bioplastics, including pesky PET, are being degraded by engineered organisms. Microbes that produce nitrogen are even being used as a synthetic fertilizer to reduce our dependence on ammonia, the production of which is energy intensive and wasteful.

Synthetic biologists are rerouting the metabolic pathways of these same organisms so that they consume carbon dioxide and methane rather than sugar. As our ability to reliably and rapidly engineer organisms improves, living cells increasingly will be used to produce goods at industrial scales. Synthetic biology solutions can be implemented in many sectors of cities and municipalities to address current challenges in sustainable fuel production, waste and carbon emissions recycling, improvement of crop yields and for the production of high-nutrient foods.

These applications will have broad benefits regardless where human communities arise, and the same technologies that will help sustain us on earth also will support our journey to inhabit the stars.

Aboard the International Space Station, orbiting earth at nearly five miles per second, engineered seeds are growing into plants that soon could manufacture specific proteins, including antiviral antibodies, on-demand. NASA is also exploring synthetic biology to convert carbon dioxide to valuable organic materials on Mars and in deep space, as crude oil and other carbon sources will not be readily available. Other scientists are actively exploring ways to leverage synthetic organisms to produce food in space or to help terraform Mars’ atmosphere.

The realization of these seemingly far-flung dreams is brought closer by the businesses engaged in synthetic biology R&D. More companies join the biological revolution every day, eager to improve their products while reducing cost and waste.

Industrial synthetic biology is already making a dent in the circular economy.

If cells can be engineered to convert carbon to fuels and medicine, so too can they be modified to convert waste products — such as those billions of tons produced annually — to do the same. But plausibility rarely translates to lasting results. Take the city of Chicago as an example.

In 2015, residents and activities in Chicago generated 32 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (PDF). Reducing these exorbitant emissions is no small feat, and it is unlikely that a single remedy will provide a full solution. But synthetic biology can, and already is, making cities such as Chicago more sustainable by converting carbon emissions to valuable materials.

LanzaTech is an industrial-level synthetic biology company that harnesses carbon waste and converts it to transportation fuel using engineered organisms. It opened its first industrial facility outside of Beijing last year, which collects emissions from a steel factory and generates more than 16 million gallons of ethanol per year. Soon, the company will expand to four additional facilities, reducing emissions comparable to removing hundreds of thousands of cars from the road each year.

Chemical giant DuPont is also actively shifting its R&D towards synthetic biology solutions that can mitigate pesky chemical manufacturing issues through its Industrial Biosciences division. It already operates large, active research programs to reduce food waste, produce fuels renewably and manufacture biomaterials with market-driven solutions using genetically engineered organisms. Earlier this year, DuPont began construction on a new European headquarters for its Industrial Biosciences division in the Netherlands, with the aim of expanding global impact.

Other companies are exploring synthetic biology as a means to reduce carbon emissions in agriculture, a sector that makes up nearly 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Other companies are exploring synthetic biology as a means to reduce carbon emissions in agriculture, a sector that makes up nearly 10 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Results are incredibly promising.

Pivot Bio, based out of Berkeley, California, announced its successful development of a nitrogen-producing microorganism that can replace synthetic fertilizers. The production of ammonia is energy-intensive and wasteful, contributing many millions of tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere every year. Pivot Bio’s engineered strain will reduce the agricultural industry’s reliance on synthetic fertilizers, without impacting crop yield. In the latest growth trial, the microbe outperformed synthetic fertilizer (PDF) by 7.7 bushels per acre.

The ""meatless meat"" industry also has been expanding in recent years, leveraging the capabilities of engineered organisms to recreate the taste of real meat without the cow. Impossible Foods, creators of the famous Impossible Burger, use engineered yeast to produce heme, the major protein found in blood, to give plant-based burgers the taste of red meat.

Other companies, such as Spiber and Checkerspot, have their sights locked on producing high-performance materials from rudimentary carbon sources.

Spiber is a Japanese company that produces synthetic spider silks, foams and films by designing proteins that assemble into pre-defined patterns and structures at the molecular level. Farming silk from spiders is excruciatingly time-consuming. Now, the company can modify natural silk fibers and design new material functions in a matter of days with synthetic biology. While normal silk contracts in water, for example, Spiber has created altered versions that are hydrophobic, expanding their utility for outdoor apparel. Spiber previously partnered with The North Face to produce high-performance ski jackets made from bioengineered materials.

Pushing beyond textiles, Checkerspot, based out of Berkeley, California, engineers microalgae, a type of photosynthetic organism found in water, to produce oils that are difficult to manufacture using chemistry alone. These include oil and water-repellant coatings and even a palm oil replacement. Large areas of rainforest are cleared to produce palm oil, destroying ecosystems and exacerbating carbon emissions.

In all of these examples, nature is the breadboard and scientists are only limited by their imagination. A nearly infinite array of chemicals and materials can be produced from living organisms, with CO2 and other carbon sources, such as methane, as the fodder.

Imagination is not implementation. Despite the remarkable progress of synthetic biology over the last two decades, widespread public acceptance remains elusive. Gene editing continuously dominates headlines — a trend that is not always positive. Opposition to genetically modified (GM) crops remains especially fierce. Of those Americans that have ""heard a lot"" about GM foods, nearly half see them as health risks, despite the widespread adoption of GM foods in agriculture over the last several decades.

While synthetic biology has had less media coverage than GM food specifically, accurate and timely dissemination of information will prove crucial in swaying public acceptance, particularly as engineered organisms manufacture medicines and other consumables in greater volumes. Engineered E. coli have been used to produce human insulin since 1978 amid little public backlash, but there is no certainty that future medicines, clothing lines and fuels produced using synthetic biology will be so readily accepted.

While a circular economy has long been imagined, it only recently has become fully implementable. For this next stage of the fight, synthetic biology — along with economic incentives and political sway — will usher cities and economies, on earth and in space, toward their inexorable destinies.

471,More CEOs adopt sustainable business models – survey,"MANILA, Philippines — More chief executive officers (CEOs) in the Philippines are acknowledging the need to adopt sustainable business models, according to a survey by PwC Philippines and the Management Association of the Philippines (MAP).

Based on the results of the PwC MAP CEO Survey 2019, 80 percent of CEOs said they are planning to change their business model in the next three to five years to promote more sustainable practices.

About 83 percent of CEOs said they currently adopt sustainable practices in their business, while only 33 percent said they have formal plans of supporting their transition to a circular economy.

The circular economy is a system that seeks to keep products and materials in use for as long as possible, minimizing the amount used, extending their lifespan, and maximizing reuse and recycling of waste.

Among the sustainable practices CEOs seek to adopt in the future are lesser consumption of natural resources and materials; use of a product for different functions; and repair of a defective product so it can be used for its original function.

While majority of the CEOs fully support sustainable business practices, they identified high transition costs, inadequate technology, and economic viability as the main factors that are preventing them from fully adopting sustainable practices.

“Transitioning to a circular model brings in costs related to management, research and development and infrastructure. Our business leaders, however, should realize that the circular economy is a long-term strategy that helps address the serious environmental and business risks that we are facing,” PwC Philippines consulting managing principal Benjamin Azada said.

Azada also emphasized that this year’s survey results show the growing awareness for climate change and environmental damage issues among CEOs as 82 percent of respondents identified it as potential threats to an organization’s growth.

“What’s driving the move to circular economy worldwide is really customer behavior. In other countries, the reason why companies are being compelled to a circular economy and adopt more sustainable practices is because customers, the public, are demanding it. So there’s no choice for them not to do it,” Azada said.

“As that pressure grows and the clamor becomes louder, we’ll see more companies adopt them,” he added.

Meanwhile, PwC Philippines chairman and senior partner Alexander Cabrera expressed optimism the number of CEOs who adopt sustainable practices would continue to rise.

“While most are still using the traditional practices related to energy use and recycling, a good number have plans of shifting to a circular business model,” Cabrera said.

“A profitable business is not necessarily good business if it does not lead to ‘good’ growth, which is sustainable and emphatic,” he said.

Cabrera also said that while companies have expressed plans of moving toward the circular economy, it’s going to be a challenge for them to look for support services for this.

He emphasized that the implementation of incentives for companies that provide circular economy services such as refurbishing or recycling should be in place to help the shift of corporations to more sustainable practices.

The PwC MAP survey had a total of 127 respondents from large, medium, small and micro companies.

The survey, conducted by PwC for the 17th MAP (Management Association of the Philippines) International CEO Conference that will be held on Sept. 10 at the Makati Shangri-La Hotel, reflects the conference’s theme, “The Future of Business: Sustainability. Development. Impact.”",United States,2019.09
472,Dow and SCG form partnership to promote plastics recycling in Thailand,"Dow (Midland, Mich.; www.dow.com) and SCG Chemicals Co. (Bangkok, Thailand; ) signed a collaboration agreement to develop new complete recycling solutions to add value to plastic waste and prevent them from ending up in the environment. This agreement is an attempt to create a circular economy for plastic in Thailand.

“Our industry and society as a whole must do a better job of capturing and reusing plastic by scaling investments in collection, waste management, recycling technologies and new end-markets,” said Jim Fitterling, chief executive officer of Dow. “Dow continues to join forces with partners across the globe to more effectively reuse and recycle plastic waste. Working together with companies like SCG we can create a world where no plastic ends up in the environment.”

The agreement was signed today upon the shared vision to close the loop of plastics waste management for the reduction of plastic leakage to the environment.

The products anticipated from this collaboration are outputs of mechanical recycling, feedstock recycling as well as renewable feedstock which include but are not limited to recycled resin, recycled products made from plastic waste, petrochemical feedstocks from plastic waste and renewable plastic resins.

“This collaboration not only represents our joint commitment in taking action to solve the problems through technology and making real changes but also provides us with new business opportunity, enhancing sustainability and bringing about practical solutions for recycling and upcycling of plastic waste in Thailand,” said Roongrote Rangsiyopash, president and chief executive officer of SCG.

“Circular economy is an economic opportunity as much as a solution to a pressing environmental issue,” said Jonathan Penrice, president of Dow in Asia Pacific. “We will build on Dow’s unique materials science and application knowledge and our 50-year experience in Thailand to develop solutions that maximize the value of plastics in the country.”

This collaboration is aligned with the Thai government’s ambition to drastically increase the recycling rate of plastic waste in the country by 2027. Plastic waste in the environment is considered a critical environmental issue which Dow and SCG have innovated around in the past, such as developing certain technologies to incorporate materials derived from transformed plastic waste in polymer modified asphalt roads. This solution will add value to low or no value plastic waste such as multi-layer plastic packaging and contaminated plastic waste.",United States,2019.09
473,Dow signs up to chemical recycling •,"Chemical giant Dow has struck a deal with the Fuenix Ecogy Group for the supply of pyrolysis oil feedstock, made from recycled plastic waste. 

The feedstock will be used to produce new polymers at Dow’s production facilities at Terneuzen, The Netherlands.

Dow says the polymers produced from the pyrolysis oil will be identical to products made from traditional feedstocks and can be used in similar applications, including food packaging.

 The agreement helps to deliver Dow’s ‘circular economy’ strategy of integrating recycled content and renewable feedstocks into its production processes. It also contributes to Dow’s commitment to incorporate at least 100 000 tonnes of recycled plastic in its product offerings sold in the EU by 2025.

‘We believe plastics are too valuable to be lost as waste and should be part of the circular economy,’ says Diego Donoso, business president for Dow Packaging & Specialty Plastics. 

 ‘With partners in South America, we have supported the development of construction materials made with recycled plastics for schools and in Southeast Asia, Mexico and the United States, we have built roads made with recycled plastics. This partnership with Fuenix is an important next step in moving us closer to the future we envision, which is the “c” of circular polymers.’

Sirt Mellema, ceo of Fuenix, based in Weert in The Netherlands, adds: ‘This partnership offers us the opportunity to scale up our technology. Our ambition is to ensure the value of plastic waste is fully used to create new, circular plastic while significantly reducing the global use of virgin raw materials and CO2 emissions.’

481,Assess flame retardants with care—Response,"Osimitz et al. suggest that we mischaracterized all halogenated flame retardants (FRs) by classifying them as one class of hazardous compounds. We agree that there are differences among FR classes and subclasses. However, over the past two decades, we have repeatedly observed a pattern of regrettable substitutions, in which one harmful FR was replaced by another that was later found to be potentially harmful (1, 2). In each case, it took years for toxicologists to prove the harmful effects of the substitute. Meanwhile, the production of the harmful FRs continued and high volumes of these chemicals were released into our environment, resulting in human exposure to millions of people (3–5). Once ample evidence was available, a new substitute appeared on the market and the process repeated itself. Therefore, we urgently ask regulatory authorities to breach this cycle and be much more active in restricting the production of hazardous FRs.

Osimitz et al. propose FRs that use polymeric compounds with high molecular weight as a way forward. We mentioned the only one that has been identified, the butadiene styrene brominated copolymer, in our Perspective. Other polymeric FRs are still considered confidential business information, preventing most scientists from characterizing their toxicity and exposure potential. Indeed, such polymers are not bioavailable. However, they pose a clear disadvantage in the circular economy, as they are difficult to recycle due to the high concentration of bromine in the polymer (6). In addition, we do not know what will happen with those compounds later in their life; will they fall apart and degrade to more harmful halogenated substances? When these materials end up in a landfill or if they are burned, they present a risk for the formation of hazardous polybrominated dioxins and furans (6).

We agree that there may be one or two organohalogen FRs that are not considered toxic, but there are many more non-halogenated FRs that are considered safer, as we emphasized in our Perspective. The European research project ENFIRO generated a report documenting a series of safer alternatives, such as zinc stannate, melamine polyphosphate, and aluminium diethylphosphinate for many applications (7). In addition, most halogen-free FRs perform better in smoke suppression and decrease the amount of hazardous gases such as benzene and toluene released from polyvinyl chloride during combustion, which may save more lives (8).

There is a rational argument for using available non-halogenated alternatives such as metal-based or melamine-based FRs. Ultimately, testing for harmful effects of these chemicals before use should be carried out by industry. Chemical FRs should be “benign by design” (9).",United States,2019.09

483,Popenomics,"T few more incongruous places for a seminar on the future of business than the Sacred Convent of Assisi, in Italy. From Schumpeter’s cell high in the convent’s outer walls, the view over rural Umbria was so beautiful it was like looking at the world through God’s eyes—not those of Mammon. The convent houses the nearly 800-year-old tomb of Saint Francis, the most poetic of holy men, who thought money was worth less than asses’ dung and inspired a mendicant order. On a night-time visit business-school students surrounded his tomb, as Franciscans in black robes charmed them with stories of their austere daily lives. The only gripe was that early friars failed to foresee that the thick medieval stonework would one day interfere with Wi-Fi.

The week-long seminar on business, work and the circular economy, in early September, had divine overtones. Organised by some of Italy’s leading universities, it laid the groundwork for a meeting between Pope Francis and entrepreneurs, academics and students in Assisi next March to discuss the “Economy of Francesco”, in homage to the saint. The pope’s aim is to draw on the ideas of the young, as well as on veterans of development such as Amartya Sen, an Indian economist, and Jeffrey Sachs, an American one, to create a more sustainable and humane economy.

Many businessmen—even Catholic ones—roll their eyes. They recoil at too much pontification on the shortcomings of private enterprise. Yet Pope Francis has a knack for catching the zeitgeist. On everyone’s lips in Assisi was the decision by 181 chief executives in America’s Business Roundtable in August to reject the idea that maximising shareholder value was their main goal. Stefano Zamagni, an economist at the University of Bologna (who teases modern capitalists with the pithy “a rising tide lifts only the yachts”), saw it as a watershed event. He acknowledges that it could have been a “social-marketing” ploy to keep big business’s critics at bay. But, he asks, “Who am I to judge?”

It is a good time for reflection. Both capitalism and the Catholic church are suffering crises of faith. The reputation of big business has been damaged by the global financial crisis, inequality and environmental harm. The church is reeling from the fallout of the sexual abuse of children by priests. Both are casting about for ways to rebuild their reputations. It is intriguing that each thinks that re-evaluating economic principles may be the way forward.

The starting-point in Assisi was that business and the Catholic church go back a long way together. Though Saint Francis ditched his life as son of a well-heeled merchant for a tunic of coarse wool, his followers helped lay the foundations of a market economy in the Middle Ages by establishing the rule of law and a role for credit. In Umbria Franciscans set up the first pawn shops in the 1460s. Luca Pacioli, who first wrote on double-entry book-keeping, was a Franciscan friar. In the past century so-called Catholic social teaching explored different economic doctrines and grew more pro-capitalist from the 1980s—in tandem with the rise of the Anglo-American concept of shareholder value.

Things are changing. Pope Francis, an Argentine, is the first pontiff to come from the world’s less-developed south. His language on the economy is often incendiary, referring to it as “unjust at its root”. He blames big business, more than governments, for crony capitalism, while ignoring the role firms have played in helping lift many out of poverty through globalisation. He is scornful of financial markets, downplaying how important they are to economic activity. Some businesspeople view him with the same mistrust they would Jeremy Corbyn or Bernie Sanders.

But in two ways, business folk should heed his message, particularly those who care about the long term. His “Laudato Si’”, an encyclical published in 2015 on climate change, sums up as eloquently as anything written so far the pressure from runaway growth on resources—and humans. It calls business “a noble vocation”, especially if it creates jobs. It celebrates new forms of technology, provided human responsibility develops alongside. But it notes that unbridled economic expansion is squeezing the planet dry. The rich may have to forsake some natural resources so that the poorer world can develop. It sounds radical. It is also common sense.

The pope makes an argument about individual morality, too. A balanced life is one of self-restraint. To illustrate what he means, attendees at the Assisi seminar were shuttled to Brunello Cucinelli, a €1.9bn ($2.1bn) maker of cashmere garments. Its eponymous founder keeps a bust of Marcus Aurelius, the Roman emperor-philosopher, outside his office and talks passionately about ethics. In May he invited a dozen or so “young Leonardos”, including Amazon’s (55-year-old) Jeff Bezos, to his hilltop home to discuss humanity’s future. No doubt he told them about “gracious growth”: his preference for revenues to rise by no more than 8-10% a year, and margins to stay at 16-17%. That, he says, is enough to sustain workers, shareholders and the environment.

Easy for Mr Cucinelli to say, you might think. Few companies can hope for such results, at least outside Silicon Valley. But many Catholics wary of Pope Francis would agree with the garment-maker’s general point that business and morality should go hand in hand. Philip Booth, a Catholic economist from Britain, likens separating ethics from economics to separating ethics from sex—and teaching about sex purely in biological terms.

Make it Assisi as you can

Where things get more contentious is in recommending a course of action. Faced with climate change and inequality, the temptation is to call for draconian top-down measures to throttle economic activity. If the “Economy of Francesco” leans in that direction, it will fail. But if it stresses bosses’ commitment to behave as responsible citizens, corporate or otherwise, it may have a positive effect. At a time when the world is an unholy mess, even asking basic questions about the purpose of business has some virtue. ■",United States,2019.09

485,Leyla Acaroglu: the disruptive designer reshaping minds to change the world,"In September 2019, the UN Environment Programme will honour Champions of the Earth, outstanding environmental leaders from the public and private sectors, and from civil society who have had a transformative positive impact on the environment. Here we meet previous winners of this prestigious award and find out how they still are making a difference in their communities and across the globe.

Leyla Acaroglu traces her passion for disruptive design to twin epiphanies in her late teens: the realization that her survival was intrinsically linked to the health of the planet and the simultaneous conviction that she was incredibly privileged to be able to do something about that life-changing appreciation.

“I was really surprised that nobody had told me that everything is interconnected, including me. Every second of every day, I rely on the planet to survive and my health and well-being is directly linked to the natural environment,” the Australian said.

Just as she grasped her place in the natural ecosystem, another epiphany struck.

“I was pen pals with a young female refugee in one of the detention centres in Australia. She was my age and she had fled Iran and wanted to study. I was very moved by the reality of my freedom and her lack of freedom… It became very obvious to me that as a young female who was fortunate enough to grow up in Australia, I was able to agentize myself… and commit to something that was going to have a bigger impact than just my immediate needs.”

And so she did. Today, Acaroglu is a self-proclaimed “positive disruptor”, an educator, a designer, a social scientist and a powerful advocate for a new world order where the take-make-dispose logic of the linear global economy will be replaced with a circular and regenerative model.

In 2016, Acaroglu won the UN Environment Programme’s Champion of the Earth award for science and innovation for her work to bring about positive environmental and social change through innovation.

“Winning the award really helped establish some of the work I’ve been doing as a professional ‘positive disruptor’ and allows more people to see that there are different ways to engage with the big problems we face,” she said.

Among her many projects, Acaroglu devised the Disruptive Design Method to promote circularity in all aspects of product and service creation. She creates educational programmes on circularity, advises businesses on sustainability and has bought a farm in Portugal to regenerate and restore.

Through it all, she has held onto the empathy that inspired her younger self.

“A lot of the reason I do sustainability is because of the entrenched poverty and lack of opportunity faced by so many people,” she said. “I could never undo that experience of realizing that I had a voice to speak for other people… For every one of me, there are 10,000 potential mes that don’t have that opportunity.”

Acaroglu’s multifaceted expertise and boundless enthusiasm for sustainable living are exactly the qualities expected to be on display at a pivotal Climate Action Summit in New York on 23 September 2019.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres has urged world leaders, businesses and civil society to come to the summit with concrete ideas of how they will cut emissions by 45 per cent in the next decade and achieve net zero emissions by 2050, in line with the Paris Climate Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. What is required is a full transformation of global economies.

This is Acaroglu’s philosophy in a nutshell. But she recognizes that the status quo is a powerful force that can limit leaders’ potential to tackle problems effectively.

“It is important that we give people—at all levels of decision-making and power—the opportunity to change their minds, to think differently, to experience what it could be like if we do not just reinforce the status quo of diplomacy and of business,” she said.

One of the most pervasive and persistent examples of the status quo is the linear nature of the global economy.

“The linear production model is an addictive model and so nearly every business, even the ones that want to transfer to a circular economy, are addicted to a linear model of selling consumers goods designed for landfill,” she said, noting that a global reconditioning of business is required to turn this notion on its head.

It is an enormous ask but there are signs of progress with more dynamic leaders coming forward and daring to disrupt traditional ways of doing business.

Acaroglu cites recycling firm TerraCycle’s Loop system, a global shopping and reuse platform, as a positive movement towards a fully circular production system, and says many small and medium-sized enterprises are seriously committing to circularity. She is also delighted to see more design agencies seeking her advice on providing circular economy services to their clients.

This shift is partly the result of consumers demanding more sustainable products and services. Acaroglu is working with the UN Environment Programme on a sustainability lifestyle project called Anatomy of Action that aims to show that each individual can be part of the solution by making informed, deliberate choices about how they live and what they consume. This is one of many initiatives being undertaken across the UN System of funds, programmes and agencies as part of a larger social mobilization campaign called #ActNow. Over 170,000 actions have been logged on the ActNow platform. The activities raise awareness, ambition, and action on climate and hope to accelerate implementation of the Paris Agreement and sustainable living overall.

Acaroglu is passionate about the need to equip young people with the cognitive and creative tools necessary to take a leap into an alternative future. In 2014, she founded The UnSchool of Disruptive Design—a global experimental knowledge laboratory for creative rebels and change agents. If Acaroglu’s work inspires these budding innovators, they also galvanize her.

“The UnSchool and the work I do with these people who are coming to learn how to change in the world, is the biggest optimism shot I could get any day of the week,” she said.

In her bid to rework education, Acaroglu has designed a circular economy curriculum—the Circular Classroom—for Finland and is working on another for Southeast Asia. She is also a passionate advocate for disrupting the gender-based stereotypes of leadership. This thinking reflects calls by the United Nations for women to be included as key decision makers in the critical transformation needed to tackle climate change.

“The gender debate is not one-sided,” Acaroglu said. “What we need is for women to be given more space to show leadership and men to be given more space to be emotionally mature and intelligent. It’s a big problem and I would love to see it tackled because it directly affects our ability to solve problems.”

Her own environmental champions include Afroz Shah, the Indian lawyer behind the world’s biggest beach clean-up in Mumbai and a fellow Champion of the Earth, and designer Ron Finley, the ‘gangsta gardener’ on a mission to bring urban gardening to South Los Angeles and beyond.

For Acaroglu, leadership through action is key but inspiring others to step up becomes more difficult when the prevailing narrative is one of despair. This idea that our climate crisis is too profound and too complex to address is sapping the energy of younger generations, Acaroglu says. Yet again education and understanding are key. Learning to hope may be the most important lesson of all.

“When you understand that the world is this dynamic, interconnected, chaotic mess of opportunity and challenges, then you are equipped with the tools to see that you can turn challenges into something else. That resilience, the ability to be flexible in the mind and see the future as being different to the present, that’s something we need to make sure all of our young people have,” she said.

“Now is the time to take all of that technology and all of that power and that collaboration and figure out how to be a force that is giving back to the planet that created us rather than continually extracting. That’s the challenge of my lifetime and I hope to inspire future generations to be able to take on that challenge.”",United States,2019.09

487,AptarGroup's Deal With PureCycle Offers Sustainable Packaging,"AptarGroup, Inc. ATR recently entered into a partnership with PureCycle Technologies, as it looks to integrate Ultra-Pure Recycled Polypropylene (UPRP) into dispensing applications.



Invented and licensed by Procter & Gamble PG, PureCycle’s ground-breaking, patented recycling process removes color, odor and any other contaminants from plastic-waste feedstock to transform it into virgin-like UPRP resin. Interestingly, this process makes recycled plastics more accessible to companies willing to use a sustainable, recycled resin.



AptarGroup brings UPRP into its dispensing systems portfolio through partnering with PureCycle. Further, UPRP aims to satisfy customers’ needs for sustainable packaging, particularly in the food and cosmetics markets. Hence, the strategic affiliation with PureCycle supports AptarGroup’s vision for a circular economy, where materials and products are recycled without being reduced to waste.

 

While accessing UPRP resin, AptarGroup will propose solutions to help its customers achieve their sustainable packaging goals. Further, the partnership ensures more opportunities for AptarGroup for a circular-product life cycle.

Per the Transparency Market research, the global polypropylene market is valued at more than $80 billion and is on track to reach $133.3 billion by 2023. Furthermore, the Association of Plastics Recyclers (APR) has identified that North America has major demand for high-quality recycled polypropylene.

 

AptarGroup is committed to create top-quality, sustainable products and thus, has been partnering with several sustainability organizations for sustainable products within the packaging industry. The company’s all-plastic recyclable solutions are made with post-consumer recycled resin and available in North America and Europe. Moreover, the company continues to explore additional opportunities for sustainable resins. Also, AptarGroup will support its customers’ goal to achieve 100% reusable packaging by 2025.

 

Recently, AptarGroup entered into a partnership with Loop — TerraCycle’s global circular shopping platform — which will enable customers to purchase their products for reusable packaging.



AptarGroup remains committed toward expanding its business through acquisitions to broaden the scope of technologies, geographic presence and product offerings. In sync with this, the company acquired CSP Technologies — a leader in active packaging technology based on proprietary material science expertise. This June, AptarGroup acquired Nanopharm and Gateway Analytical, which will likely help expand its service portfolio that supports pharmaceutical and biotech customers.

488,Conscious Capitalism: Are You Driven By More Than Just Money?,"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

The ""business for good"" movement is one of the most important advances of the last 100 years, and we’re still in the beginning stages. We’re steadily moving the concept of shared value from the periphery to the core of businesses, connecting company success with social progress. This is a fundamental shift from the previous doctrine that the purpose of a company is solely to generate profit, and is far from an overnight change.

Most are now aware of the growth and need for purpose-driven companies. They are a response to consumer demand, as buyers seek out brands that help them make a positive impact in the world. Startups and market newcomers are at the forefront putting purpose and impact at the core of their brands. Impact brands are growing far faster than the rest, which explains why legacy brands have been purchasing these companies faster than ever.

So where do entrepreneurs take the movement from here?

Learning to leverage our technology resources to achieve society's highest goals is a good start. For example, consider startups building the access economy. These ventures are creating far more efficient and sustainable systems for deploying our resources given the trajectory of possession overshoot we are on. From Airbnb and Poshmark to peer-to-peer transportation and fashion brands focused on the circular economy such as Rent A Runway, these models are a tremendous example for entrepreneurs. The movement towards access and away from ownership, however, flies in the face of the economic model we’ve previously fostered that rewards private consumption as growth.

For example, if an economy consisting of 50 cars retained by 50 owners suddenly switches to a sharing system of only 10 cars for 50 individuals (since cars are typically idle 80-plus percent of the time), our economy would contract by 80 percent. Creating efficiency, in this case, to support a goal of homeostasis with our planet and improving human health, is not rewarded in a system driven by private consumption. So, we as entrepreneurs, the rulebreakers in business, need to continue doing exactly that, by redefining the concept of successful businesses to align with public health and environmental sustainability.

Secondly, we should focus on using business to transform our culture for the better. In the advertising industry, I’m always looking at the ways brand messaging is affecting people at both a psychological and sociological level. Are they promoting dissatisfaction with ourselves, preying on people’s fears of missing out and instilling a sense of incompleteness? Brands have overwhelmingly taken this approach since the Industrial Revolution radically increased production capacity, spurred by the likes of Paul Mazur who spearheaded modern-day advertising as a way to shift people towards a society of needs: “People must be trained to desire, to want new things even before the old have been entirely consumed. Man’s desires must overshadow his needs.” It’s no wonder our world suffers from low self-esteem and confidence while we simultaneously see the rapid disintegration of the fabric of our societies and the collapse of the environment we depend on for life.

As entrepreneurs we must reshape the relationship of business to people, using it as a tool to create connection and community, promote empathy and help people find their own sense of purpose in the world. Take Bombas for example, a simple sock company started in 2013 that gives a pair of socks to a person experiencing homelessness for every pair a customer buys. It’s nothing radical, but that simple premise makes everyone who buys a pair of Bombas feel a little more connected and a little more inspired by helping someone in need in a world that is increasingly disconnected and lacking meaning.

There is no silver bullet to how we reorient business towards serving the needs of humanity. But it is increasingly important as trust in business as an institution declines. Frameworks like B Corporations and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals are great benchmarks but are incomplete as a measuring stick for the ways we define success in business. These initiatives, by themselves, do not fundamentally change what is and isn’t valued in the market. As entrepreneurs, we need to continue pushing the envelope. We will ruffle the feathers of those with entrenched interests along the way, but in doing so we can transform business to serve the greatest needs of humanity and restore balance within our planet. Entrepreneurs, by our very definition, are more risk-tolerant by nature and willing to buck prevailing norms than other varieties of leaders. For this reason, there is great potential that lies in the ability of entrepreneurs to be leading the charge.",United States,2019.09
490,Avery Dennison Teams with Plastic Bank to Further the Circular Economy,"When the Ellen MacArthur Foundation made the startling prediction that by 2050 there could be more plastic in the world’s ocean than fish (by weight), it made big news. And for good reason. But along with the headlines, came action plans by corporations both big and small.

For Avery Dennison, the news confirmed that the material science and label company was on the right track with its aggressive sustainability goals, which include creating products that have a positive environmental impact far beyond the company’s own operations.

Already, it derives 40 percent of its revenue from sustainable solutions like polybags made from recycled plastic or renewable, bio-based sources.

“While we are well on our way to achieving our 2025 ambitions, we are still aggressively pursuing ways to increase the recycled content in our products, improve their recyclability and enable the circular economy,” said Michael Colarossi, vice president, product line management, innovation and sustainability for apparel solutions for Avery Dennison.

To further its progress, the company has teamed with Plastic Bank, an organization that makes post-consumer plastic waste a currency residents of some of the poorest communities in the world can use to purchase necessities and even pay for opportunities like school tuition.

Essentially, the organization has created an environmental and social win-win. To date, it reports recovering more than 10 million pounds of ocean-bound plastic and helping to supplement the income of over 4,000 impoverished families.

For Avery Dennison, Plastic Bank’s dual focus is a perfect fit. “We don’t see addressing single-use plastic as a ’cause;’ we see it as an imperative. We are also committed to positively contributing to the communities in which we operate,” Colarossi said.

Both companies are quick to point out that plastic isn’t the problem—it’s how we make, use and dispose of it that needs to be rethought.

For Avery Dennison that means creating products like Printed Fabric Labels, which are made from recycled polyester, require less energy and water usage, and are themselves recyclable.

In addition to repurposing the plastic waste the charity recovers into a yarn source for its labels, the company is licensing the technology to its competitors, which creates a revenue stream that’s funneled back into Plastic Bank.

This so-called Social Plastic® ecosystem is the circular economy at work. And Avery Dennison is constantly looking for ways to step up its efforts even more to head off irreparable damage.

“Plastic pollution is directly responsible for the deaths of millions of marine animals and seabirds every year, not including the immeasurable losses from habitat destruction. Microplastics contaminate the water supply and food chain of every living being on Earth, having been discovered as remotely as the Arctic Central Basin,” said David Katz, founder and CEO of Plastic Bank. “The ocean plastic problem also inhibits the ocean’s ability to act as a carbon sink, which exacerbates climate change, and virgin plastic production leaves an enormous carbon footprint to begin with.”

Thanks to the growing realization of the harm single-use plastics can have on the environment, Avery Dennison believes corporations and end consumers alike are more open than ever to supporting solutions to the problem—even if they cost more.

In the case of recycled content PFLs, Colarossi said there’s a “minimal” upcharge over conventional labels but the mission is what will really sell them—and the more they’re used, the greater the probability of bringing the cost down.

Colarossi anticipates momentum to grow behind PFLs because they have a great story and because today’s shopper is educated about the connection between their purchases and the products, processes and people behind them.

“More and more consumers are becoming aware of some of the environmental and social challenges that the apparel industry faces, and they are starting to speak with their wallets. As they do, we have seen a dramatic increase in apparel brands seeking ‘eco-friendly’ products, especially within the last 18 months,” Colarossi said. “Not only is it the right thing to do for our planet, but it is becoming a significant reputation and financial priority for apparel brands all around the world.”

To date, Avery Dennison offers a sustainable alternative for most of its products, and it’s on track to generate 70 percent of its revenue from these products by 2025.

“Solving the ocean plastic problem will require a joint effort from people and industry,” Katz said. “Leaders like Avery Dennison are critical to the Social Plastic® revolution because they empower their customers to create change simply by choosing Social Plastic®.”",United States,2019.09
491,Marshall eyes circular economy as Nova's first director of sustainability,"With the importance of a circular economy on the rise, Nova Chemicals Corp. has named Sarah Marshall as its first director of sustainability.

Marshall has been with Calgary, Alberta-based Nova, a major North American polyethylene resin maker, since 1997. In her new role, she's responsible for leading efforts to achieve Nova's vision for sustainability.

Marshall discussed her new role in an interview with Plastics News.

""There's been a lot of focus on plastics in the environment from the public and the media,"" she said. ""Polyethylene brings a significant amount of value through lightweighting and by being cost-effective. That's the message we want to get across.""

Nova has been involved in Responsible Care efforts in Canada since 1985. The firm earlier this year became a founding member of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, a group of almost 40 global firms that have pledged $1.5 billion to help solve the problem of plastic waste on a global scale.

""We're committed to the goal, but we have a long way to go,"" Marshall said.

In her new role at Nova, Marshall will oversee the firm's corporate investments in supporting collaboration and promoting ocean health. She'll also serve on industry association boards and committees.

Nova officials said that Marshall is well positioned for that role because of her former tenure as chair of the board of directors for the Canadian Plastics Industry Association (CPIA).",United States,2019.09
496,"Meet CHEP: The Unsung Leader in Circular, Data-Driven Transport Solutions","The market leader in wooden pallets is a company called CHEP, which has 300 million assets in over 55 countries. It’s become something of a quiet hero in the burgeoning circular economy.

Reusing wood pallets can significantly reduce logging, which cuts down on GHG emissions and saves money. All of CHEP’s assets are rented, collected and reused; this saves a lot of virgin material, but the company also knew more could be done.

In June, CHEP’s parent company, Brambles, launched “Zero Waste World,” an initiative that will increase circularity and efficiencies of CHEP and its customers. It aims to decrease waste by increasing its range of reusable supply chain packaging options (which CHEP President Laura Nador explored in a keynote at SB’19 Detroit). The company will collaborate with customers that are shipping products in opposite directions to transport and reduce empty truck miles. By carefully tracking its assets, CHEP and Brambles leverage their data to reduce inefficiencies.

We caught up with Jonathan North, Zero Waste World North America Program Lead at Brambles, to learn more.

Your company handles transportation solutions including providing wooden pallets, containers and crates. What role does this play in a circular economy?

Jonathan North: The CHEP business model is inherently circular. Our investment in high-quality, returnable assets (pallets, crates and containers) is a direct contributor to the circular economy, where these assets are reused and shared many times. We further prolong the life of these durable products through rigorous inspection, repair and washing procedures, which reduces the overall demand for raw material.

Do customers come to you first to save money or first to reduce their footprint?

JN: We believe that environmental and economic benefits go hand in hand. Typically, in our business model, more sustainable solutions cost the end user less money, so we can satisfy our customers’ supply chain needs from an environmental or an economic point of view. Having said that, it seems that the pendulum is now shifting more towards the environmental argument, which the Zero Waste World program strongly reinforces.

How are you using data about the flow of your containers around the world to help customers reduce resource use?

JN: We have access to a substantial amount of information about where and how goods are shipped throughout North America. This supply chain data, in combination with strong collaborations with our customers, helps us to identify opportunities to optimize these flows. We can now specifically focus on reducing waste, eradicating empty transport miles and cutting out other inefficiencies that help reduce resource use.

For companies that wish to reduce their footprint from logistics, what are some of the first places they should look?

JN: One major opportunity is to identify empty transport miles in the supply chain. This is one of the focus areas in Zero Waste World. Industry statistics indicate that there are as many as 50 billion empty truck miles driven each year in the US, equivalent to 28 percent of the total distance they travel. That represents a substantial opportunity for reducing a very important and relevant footprint.

Can you give us an example of how you collaborated with one or more customers using your data to reduce empty travel miles or increase efficiency?

JN: CHEP and JBS, a leading processor of meat and poultry, collaborated to eliminate almost 900,000 empty truck miles from its supply chain; and in doing so, also eliminated 3.3 million pounds of CO2 emissions. We are continually looking to collaborate with our partners to identify similar opportunities to increase the utilization of transportation equipment, benefiting both the bottom line and the environment.",United States,2019.09
497,Packaging culture and the circular economy,"Packaging culture is rapidly turning into a trend. In some places, you can now eat your food along with the package. Designers are finding as many alternatives to plastic as possible: bowls made of mushrooms, bags from cassava starch. But are we ready to accept them?

They’re part of the “circular economy” that eschews linear “take, make, waste” models leading from manufacturing plant to supermarket, consumer to landfill. The circular economy instead promotes reuse, repair and recycle (R3) thinking.

It ultimately creates a path that’ll cut single-use plastics, end mindless consumption and tackle climate change, helping save the planet.",United States,2019.09
498,"""We're looking at a change of our total business"" says IKEA sustainability chief Lena Pripp-Kovac","IKEA has committed to becoming a circular business by 2030, by eliminating waste and reusing resources. A year into the project, sustainability head Lena Pripp-Kovac tells Dezeen how they're getting on.

The Swedish furniture giant announced last year that it plans to make all its products according to circular principles by 2030, meaning that they can be reused, refurbished or recycled. It will use only renewable or recycled materials across its entire range.

Called People and Planet Positive, the strategy was launched in June 2018, with the first report following earlier this year. Lena Pripp-Kovac, who is head of sustainability at IKEA, is the person responsible for making the transformation happen.

""The aim is to remove waste,"" Pripp-Kovac told Dezeen in an exclusive interview. ""It's a big journey but it's also quite exciting because it's possible.""

""People need to sleep, people need to eat and people need to play and provide for their families,"" she continued. ""How do we do that without being wasteful?""

One of the world's biggest companies, IKEA last year generated 38.8 billion euros in retail sales at 422 stores in more than 50 countries and online. It accounts for 0.1 per cent of all global greenhouse gas emissions, if you include everything from sourcing materials to customers' use of products in their own homes.

The entire range of around 12,000 IKEA products will need to be reconsidered in line with the strategy. Pripp-Kovac's role covers the product and food range, as well as supply, production and franchising.

A circular business is one that eliminates waste and pollution while restoring natural systems. If the entire global economy could become circular, then human society could thrive without depleting the earth of its resources or destroying ecosystems.

Circular-economy champion Ellen MacArthur, founder of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, explained the difference between today's linear economy and the circular alternative in a recent interview with Dezeen.

""[Today's] linear economy is a straight line, no matter how efficient you make it,"" MacArthur explained. ""If you make a car with less material, if you make a car using less energy, you're still using stuff. You're still consuming materials.""

""Whereas within a circular model, from the outset you design in a way whereby that product comes back into the system: the components are recovered, the materials are recovered.""

IKEA's move comes at a time when big business is waking up to the idea of circularity, with the eco-innovation programme leader at Adidas telling Dezeen that the circular economy is ""the solution"" and The Ellen MacArthur Foundation aiming to persuade 20 million designers to commit to circularity.

Adopting circular design is ""good for business"" says Adidas eco-innovation leader

""It is turning from the linear to the circular, of course, but the major purpose is to have a completely new take on providing more for more people, but with less resources,"" she said.

""It means that you can't just reduce the materials only, you need to reuse them, you need to start to recycle them. And you need to phase out very unsustainable processes.""

IKEA set out its goals – which are in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 – and how it plans to achieve them, in a sustainability report published last year.

""We're looking at a change of our total business,"" said Pripp-Kovac.

""It requires that you prepare the enablers to become a circular business,"" she continued. ""It's not just at the end of the process that you become circular, you really have to look, number one, at what are the materials you're using.""

The company will review its milestones year-0n-year over the coming 11 years, with the latest report due to be published early next year.

""We want to do it with facts. You want to know what it all actually means,"" said Pripp-Kovac. ""Does the new material prolong the life of a product? Does it change our consumption behaviour?""

Currently, 60 per cent of IKEA's collections are made from renewable materials and 10 per cent contain – but are not solely made from – recycled materials.

Making the changes will require ""big movements"". IKEA has committed to reducing its carbon footprint, whilst growing the business and without purchasing carbon offsetting certificates.

""There's something seriously wrong with IKEA's most sustainable store""

To achieve this, the company will need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 15 per cent across the whole IKEA value chain, in absolute terms, by 2030. This is the equivalent of cutting the climate footprint of each product by 70 per cent.

""I think the most important part is to really look at this as a change. It's not just increasing recycled materials, or putting a bin outside the store. That's just a starting point, but what happens after that?"" said Pripp-Kovac.

As the materials that make up IKEA products are the company's largest source of CO2 emissions at 36.4 per cent, Pripp-Kovac sees sourcing as a key area to tackle.

""The whole change of the materials is huge for us; making sure that we are able to use recycled materials in the best way and also being able to source differently,"" she explained.

""There are definitely things that we will need to work together with others on, such as the amount of recycled materials that are even available today,"" she continued.

""Our suppliers are the most innovative ones in finding new solutions.""

At the start of the project, the company mapped all its global waste materials, which they see as their future resources. It also made a ""roadmap"" for each material that it uses, to identify areas of improvement.

For example, wood is the primary raw material in much IKEA furniture, so it has been planting fast-growing, renewable poplar plantations in Slovakia since 2016 as a more sustainable source of timber. It is developing a more sustainable glue, which is an essential component of the particle board in many IKEA products.

To meet fire regulations, much of the company's wooden furniture must be coated with a fire retardant, that until now has been fossil-based. With an innovation partner, IKEA has developed a biodegradable, cellulose-based alternative that is recyclable.

One of the top priorities in this first year, according to Pripp-Kovac, has been the ""big shift"" of moving to recycled polyester.

""Some of the bigger moves during this year have been in polyester, as we are aiming by 2020 to have all our textile products made from recycled polyester, which is quite a big volume,"" she said.

Surprisingly, the transportation of products contributes a relatively small amount of their carbon footprint at just 3.9 per cent.

""Yes, transport is important, but we also know that it is a few per cent of our total footprint,"" said Pripp-Kovac. ""So if we do everything good in transport, which of course is on our agenda, still we will never reach our climate goals.""

How customers travel to the stores, which are usually outside the town centre, and the energy required for home deliveries, make up a much larger proportion at 15.5 per cent.

Some targets will be implemented well before 2030, such as the elimination of single-use plastic products from the IKEA home furnishing range globally by January next year.

Prolonging the life of products and materials is something that designers at IKEA are now putting at the forefront of the design process.

""Sometimes when we talk about making sure that we prolong the life of products we talk very much about the end of it,"" said Pripp-Kovac.

""I think the idea of circular really makes the point of saying that it is already in the design phase, when you start to think that you have to incorporate the whole life-cycle into what you do and how its owned and what's going to happen with it,"" she continued.

""It's also important you put it in the context of an economy, you can't be a circular economy as a big company by yourself. You need to have a network and fit into the society in order to have a circular economy.""

According to Pripp-Kovac, changing people's behaviours is as important as designing with circularity in mind, if the move from a linear to a circular economy is to be successful.

""It's a huge shift. We're all changing and I think society is changing,"" said Pripp-Kovac.

""If you want to create something new, you have to be optimistic about the possibilities to change, but the challenges are very daunting.""",United States,2019.09

504,SCG pushes mainstreaming of circular economy | Bernard L. Supetran,"LEADING Thai cement firm Siam Cement Group Public Co. Ltd. (SCG) pushed anew for the adoption of earth-friendly systems and technologies into the mainstream at the recent SD Symposium in Bangkok to help drive Thailand and Southeast Asian region in attaining sustainable development and curbing the environmental crisis.

Themed, “Circular Economy—Collaboration for Action,” the one-day forum gathered over 1,500 participants and 45 stakeholder groups from the government, private sector, community undertakings, experts and producers of earth-friendly products.

Circular economy is the use of resources in the value chain and increased efficiency of waste management, raw materials, expired products and energy to return to the resources circulated in the system using appropriate processes.

“SCG is committed to the Circular economy and started last year with ourselves. Now we are collaborating full force and we have generated more than 40 partnerships. Most important, we started to have a lot of communities that have declared themselves as a zero-waste community. We want to make this kind of change to ensure that we have a sustainable future, not only for Thailand but also for the Asean economy,” said SCG President and CEO Roongrote Rangsiyopash.

He said that since its founding in 1913, SCG has been driving sustainable development in Thailand and the Asean region by promoting balance between society, environment and business.

“More public awareness and behavioral transition in manufacturing and consumption to regenerative practices must occur along every value chain. Only with cooperation can the circular economy become a reality,” he added.

Rangsiyopash pointed out that the key areas for collaboration are on sustainable business particularly with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), the United Nations (UN), and the Thai Chamber of Commerce, as well as cooperative efforts on ocean waste, better living quality of people in communities and industrial waste management.

Initiated in 2010, the Thailand SD Symposium has created an extensive collaborative network in the country, the Asean region, and international organizations which foster the operations in various sectors for the attainment of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

The annual forum featured talks from the Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW), the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA), Circular Economy for Flexible Packaging (Ceflex), and Swedish furniture retail giant Ikea on accelerating the circular economy.

The event also included breakout sessions on Thailand Waste Management Way Forward, Transformation to the Circular Built Environment, and Partnerships for Circular Economy, with industry experts which tackled sector-specific measures.

The symposium concluded with the presentation of the four-point Strategic Proposal Presentation for Thailand Waste Management by SCG Vice Chairman Sumet Tantivejkul to Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha for appropriate action.

The action plan includes infrastructure overhaul to support waste management, promoting the business sector to manufacture products conducive to recycling, raising of public awareness to reduce waste generation and increase recycling, and strict law enforcement.

“I am very pleased to see the efforts of all sectors brainstorming to seek a solution. The government will work on improving infrastructure and make it more conducive to businesses’ transition, coupled with encouraging consumer’s behavioral changes. Therefore, the business sector must focus on improving the manufacturing process as well as developing the business models that integrate innovations,” Chan-ocha said.

The said action plan will complement the Thai government’s National Solid Waste Management Master Plan (2016-2021), and Roadmap for Plastic Waste Management (2018-2037).

“The country development based on the circular economy under the integrated network of all sectors will boost the country’s competitiveness and economy expansion with less dependence on resources. This is to improve lives and society without passing a burden to our children. I, as the government leader, will bring what you share and brainstorm today to the relevant government agencies for further implementation, as well as raising awareness among the public together to put it into action,” he added.

SCG has adopted the circular economy principles and put it into “SCG Circular way” practices by committing to the optimum usage of resources ranging from production to consumption and recovery processes.

In 2018, it has converted about 313,000 tons of industrial wastes into renewable raw materials and 131,000 tons into fuel substitutes. It also aims to reduce the production of single-use plastics from 46 percent to 20 percent, and increase the proportion of recyclable plastic packaging to 100 percent by 2025.

As part of its environmental commitment, greenhouse-gas emissions during SCG’s seven events of SD Symposium totalling to 296 tons of carbon dioxide had been offset by carbon offset projects comprising the bioenergy project and the waste heat reuse for cement production.

The company’s road to sustainable development formally started in 1991 with the adoption of its Environmental Conservation and Sustainability Policy, and subsequent programs have made it a corporate social responsibility and sustainable business direction, culminating in 2010 with the SD Symposium which highlighted multisectoral collaboration.

Established in 1913 by a royal decree of King Rama VI to produce cement, SCG has since grown continually and diversified into cement-building materials, chemicals and packaging in Southeast Asia. It is the largest and oldest cement and building material firm in Thailand and the region, and was ranked in 2016 by Forbes as the country’s second-largest and the world’s 604th-largest public company.

In 2011, it was named by FinanceAsia as among Asia’s Best Companies, which included Best Corporate Social Responsibility Award and Best Corporate Governance Award.",United States,2019.09
507,Legislative act could create catalyst in reduction of statewide plastic waste,"A new set of bills could largely reduce the production of single-use plastic in California by 2030 if passed.

Senate Bill 54 and Assembly Bill 1080, collectively called the California Circular Economy and Plastic Pollution Reduction Act, are identical companion bills that aim to reduce single-use packaging and product waste in California by 75% by 2030. The two bills were proposed by Sen. Ben Allen, who represents parts of southern and western Los Angeles county, and Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, who represents southern San Diego.

These bills come in the wake of a global plastics crisis, a spokesperson from Allen’s office said in an email statement. The spokesperson said Allen believes banning one product at a time is not working, and a comprehensive approach targeting the most problematic products will be more effective.

The bills mandate California’s Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, known as CalRecycle, to enact a scoping plan by 2023.

The scoping plan aims to investigate the logistics of implementing the bill by communicating with stakeholders about feasibility and participation. CalRecycle also needs to develop economic strategies incentivizing green production and discouraging distribution and improper disposal of single-use packaging and products, as well as determine the strength of the state’s waste management infrastructure, according to the latest version of the bills.

CalRecycle would then be responsible for enacting and enforcing regulations that require producers to reduce single-use packaging and ensure it is either recyclable or compostable by the beginning of 2024.

The bills were introduced December 2018 but have since undergone changes after discussion between legislators and interest groups.

UCLA faculty and students are optimistic about the bills and believe them to be a necessary push toward protecting the environment.

Julia Stein, supervising attorney for the Frank G. Wells Environmental Law Clinic and project director for the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA School of Law, said despite this conflict, she thinks the bills are likely to pass.

However, the target goal of 75% waste reduction by 2030 might be changed as CalRecycle determines the goal’s feasibility with current state infrastructure, she added.

“There’s no question that it will have an impact on reducing plastic waste, I think the question is how big that impact will ultimately be,” Stein said.

Magali Delmas, a professor and the director of the UCLA Center for Corporate Environmental Performance, said she hopes this bill will encourage entrepreneurs to create and promote plastic alternatives. Those alternatives will make the transition both easier and more economically desirable for businesses, she added.

“We have a very vibrant entrepreneurial economy in California in particular,” she said. “If making these changes were easy, we would have done it already. That’s why we need regulations to provide the right kind of incentive for people to change, to look for these solutions and make them more economically viable.”

Ethan Elkind, director of the Climate and Business Program at UC Berkeley School of Law and at UCLA School of Law, said achieving the waste reduction goal proposed by the bill is necessary for protecting not only the health of the environment, but of humans as well.

“We also have a major problem with plastics in the ocean – not just the explosion of garbage, but also microplastics,” he said. “These plastics start to break down, and they’re being ingested by marine life, including marine life that we humans are eating. That’s a real public health problem.”

Delmas said she hopes the mentality around recycling will change as a result of this bill.

“We think of recycling as kind of an engineering system,” she said. “We don’t really know how things happen, we don’t know where things go, how they are recycled, and we are in some ways left out of the system.”

She added she hopes this bill spurs public involvement with recycling and helps educate people on how they can become part of the system.

Sithara Menon, chair of the UCLA chapter of the California Public Interest Research Group and a third-year biology student, said she was excited the bills took strong action on businesses to make environmentally responsible decisions.

“It’s cool to see that we know a lot of these problems we’re seeing in the environment like pollution are coming from things we don’t need and shouldn’t be using,” she said.

Menon added she will also be coordinating efforts on campus to reduce waste with the eventual goal of getting UCLA to stop using single-use plastics and plastic containers.

“We know that the UC system is committed to going zero-waste, so we’re hoping that we can get UCLA to lead the way on this by committing to stopping using single-use plastics on campus,” she said.

Ms Sturgeon confirmed to MSPs that she would ""seek agreement to the transfer of power that will put the referendum beyond legal challenge"".

As she unveiled her government's plans for the year, she said the parliament had a clear, democratic mandate.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has indicated his opposition to a second vote on Scotland leaving the UK.

Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament it ""now seems inevitable that there will be an early UK general election"".

She added: ""Let me be crystal clear today - the SNP will put Scotland's opposition to Brexit and our right to choose independence at the very heart of that contest.""
• Look back on Nicola Sturgeon's address to Holyrood

Ms Sturgeon said the referendum bill that was introduced to Holyrood earlier this year was about to resume its parliamentary progress.

The bill is expected to be passed before the end of the year and the first minister has previously said she could hold a referendum in the second half of 2020.

The UK government would need to transfer power - through a Section 30 order - to allow a second referendum to be held but it has so far rejected such an agreement

Ms Sturgeon told MSPs her government intended to offer the choice of independence within this term of parliament, which ends in May 2021.

Scottish Conservative interim leader Jackson Carlaw said it was ""typical"" that the first minister's programme for government statement ""both began and ended with independence"".

""It really is the be-all-and-end-all for her nationalist government."" he said.

""The people of Scotland have had enough of this. They simply want Nicola Sturgeon to give it a rest.""

The first minister's speech detailed the 14 bills and other measures the Scottish government intends to bring forward over the next year.

The ""centrepiece"" of that would be work to tackle the climate emergency, she said.

Ms Sturgeon promised a ""Scottish Green New Deal"" that would start to create the right conditions to kick-start investment and make a ""significant impact"" on greenhouse gas emissions.

Its commitments include £500m for improved bus priority lanes to tackle congestion and increase usage.

It would also see further electrification of the railways and increase low carbon heating in new homes.

Ms Sturgeon told MSPs in the Scottish Parliament that while the Westminster government was shutting down, the Scottish government was ""stepping up"".

In April, Ms Sturgeon declared a ""climate emergency"" in her speech to the SNP conference.

She later said the Scottish government would legislate to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2045.
• More than £500m in improved bus priority infrastructure
• Putting the Highlands and Islands on a path to becoming the world's first net-zero aviation region by 2040 (trials of low or zero emission flights will begin in 2021)
• reduce emissions from Scotland's railways to zero by 2035 through the continued electrification of the network, as well as battery-powered trains and exploring the potential of hydrogen-powered trains
• An additional £17m to support the demand for ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEVs).
• ensuring that from 2024, all new homes must use renewable or low carbon heat.
• The Scottish National Investment Bank's ""primary mission"" will be helping Scotland's economy reduce carbon emissions to net-zero.

Legislation that will allow charges to be applied to single-use coffee cups will be brought in under the Circular Economy Bill, the first minister added.

The Scottish Greens said the programme for government ""lacked the ambition, scale and courage"" required to tackle the climate emergency.

The party's co-leader Patrick Harvie said: ""Scotland needs a Scottish Green New Deal which recognises the purpose, scale and bravery required of an emergency response.""

One insult, one apology: Holyrood is back

The Holyrood head count thus far today? One insult (at least). One apology. Tame, of course, by comparison with the visceral, permanent feud that is Westminster. But give them time.

I write ""head count"" advisedly. The topic was tonsorial. Raised, very unwisely, by Jackson Carlaw, he who once again finds himself the interim leader of the Scottish Conservatives.

Under teasing attack from the first minister, Mr Carlaw retorted: ""At least I've got a full head of my own naturally coloured hair!""

The chamber, Tories included, squirmed and glanced furtively at their neighbours. Did he just say that?

Meanwhile, other measures in the programme for government include:
• bringing forward the date for the first Scottish Child Payments to Christmas 2020
• making the first Job Start Payments in spring 2020
• announcing the first wave of new or refurbished schools via a £1bn school investment programme

Other bills include one that will enable councils to introduce a tourist tax.

To help improve mental health care, the first minister said her promise to install 350 counsellors in schools - a commitment made last year - would be achieved by this time next year.

The Scottish government will also work with councils on a ""community wellbeing service"", with this supported by £17m of additional funding, she said.

In addition, £10m will be made available in each of the next two years to try to deal with the ""public health emergency"" caused by drug abuse.

There was a record 1,187 drugs deaths in Scotland last year.

Another bill will see men and women able to have civil partnerships rather than marriage in Scotland.

Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said that the government had taken its eye ""off the ball"" because its primary focus was on independence.

He said: ""Communities shouldn't lose out because of the SNP's constitutional obsessions. Liberal Democrats demand better for our public services.""

511,SIDS Launch Initiative to Tackle Chemical and Waste Management | News | SDG Knowledge Hub | IISD,"27 August 2019: Representatives of Caribbean island States have launched an initiative that aims to address chemical and waste management in small island developing States (SIDS) globally, with a focus on countries in the Caribbean, and the Pacific and Indian Oceans.

The ‘Implementing Sustainable Low and Non-Chemical Development in Small Island Developing States (ISLANDS)’ programme was formally launched in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, on 27 August 2019.

The USD 450 million initiative seeks to implement regional and national solutions for preventing and managing waste and pollution in SIDS. In the Caribbean region, for example, it aims to eliminate over 9,000 metric tons of contaminated material and more than 150,000 metric tons of marine litter.

In the Caribbean, the five-year programme will bring together governments and other stakeholders to develop and implement regional legislation on chemicals and waste management, including the elimination of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), highly hazardous pesticides, and the sound management of e-waste and end-of-life vehicles. It will also, : improve control on the import of products; support the design of sanitary engineered landfills and sustainable food production systems; and promote sustainable consumption through circular economy approaches.

The capacity of SIDS to safely manage and dispose of toxic and polluting substances is under pressure from growing populations, rapid development and increasing amounts of imported goods. As of 2019, SIDS produced an average of 2.3 kilograms (kg) of waste per person per day, much of it from the tourism sector, which is 48% higher than the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average.

Speaking in advance of the ISLANDS launch, Saint Lucia’s Minister for Sustainable Development, Gale Rigobert, called for SIDS-appropriate sustainable technologies for waste treatment. While noting her country’s reliance on tourism for prosperity, she said that a business-as-usual (BAU) approach with respect to waste management and disposal practices will lead to economic losses of around USD 28 million per year due to damages from the toxic substance and waste accumulation in the environment.

Rolph Payet, Executive Secretary of the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm (BRS) Conventions, said the initiative is timely as the world is increasingly focused on illegal traffic in waste and the accumulation of plastic, especially in oceans. He acknowledged the unique challenges related to waste faced by SIDS due to their remoteness, scarcity of land and access to appropriate technology, as well as challenges resulting from economies of scale for waste management, including recycling.

The project, for which the Global Environment Facility (GEF) is providing USD 61 million, is being implemented with support from the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).

Participating countries include: Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, the Cook Islands, the Dominican Republic, the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Fiji, Guyana, Kiribati, Maldives, the Marshall Islands, Mauritius, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Samoa, Seychelles, Solomon Islands, Suriname, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, Comoros and Vanuatu.

514,Is it always circular to turn a product into a service? | Greenbiz,"This article is adapted from GreenBiz's Circular Weekly newsletter on the latest circular economy news, running Fridays. Subscribe here.

As more companies begin to explore alternatives to the linear ""sell it and forget it"" business model, Product as a Service (PaaS) is gaining traction.

One of the five core business models to enable circularity identified by Accenture, the PaaS umbrella includes rental, leasing, pay-per-use and pay-per-service models of providing items that traditionally have been purchased outright — and usually landfilled by consumers when no longer needed. When a company retains ownership of a product — whether it’s a sofa, sweater or shipping container — it is incentivized to extend product life-cycles through repair or upgrade. And it’s held accountable for a product’s end-of-life management.

In practice, users — no longer called consumers in this context — theoretically will buy fewer things, especially when they don’t plan to own them indefinitely (I’m looking at you, high school prom dresses), leading to higher asset use and less need for virgin resources. For example, given that the average power drill is used for only a short duration during its useful life, the potential for purchasing performance rather than ownership is hard to ignore.

But just because a product is offered as a service doesn’t make it circular.

Take electric scooters: this popular form of micromobility has a macro circularity problem. Take electric scooters: As GreenBiz transportation senior writer and analyst Katie Fehrenbacher wrote this week, this popular form of micromobility has a macro circularity problem.

According to a recent report by BCG, the average lifespan of a publicly accessible e-scooter is just three months. This means a significant increase in average greenhouse gas emissions per ride and a decrease in the overall environmental benefit of this alternative to individual car rides. Similarly, the popularity of ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft has exacerbated urban congestion and accounts for a 50 percent increase in traffic between 2010 and 2016 in San Francisco alone. And let’s not forget about the disturbing photos of Chinese bikeshare graveyards.

If a circular economy aims to design out waste and pollution, keep materials at their highest and best us and regenerate natural systems, these examples aren’t exactly the poster children for circularity.

Passing the circularity litmus test requires a holistic understanding of resources and material flows. It’s not only about switching one type of customer relationship for another, or a laser focus on product end-of-life management.

It’s about applying these principles across industries and value chains, considering the actual impact of new business models rather than the allure of a pivot itself.",United States,2019.09
516,thredUP partnerships open the door to secondhand shopping at major retailers,"Whether it is a handbag from the 1970s or a leather motorcycle jacket circa 1999, what’s old is new again, and online retailer thredUP sees the circular economy movement as a thriving opportunity. The consignment retailer and secondhand shop recently kicked off RAAS, or Resale-As-A-Service, a project to attract traditional department stores to get on board with more sustainable fashion.

“The closet of the future … is going to look very different than the closet of today,” said James Reinhart, CEO and co-founder of thredUP. “If you think back 10 years ago when we started, you had none of these direct-to-consumer brands. There was no such thing as rental. There were no subscription companies. In just these 10 years, we’ve had a radical shift in how people shop and buy apparel. And I think that shift is going to continue.”

The retailer collects around 100,000 pieces of secondhand items daily and says resale is growing 21 times as fast as the larger retail market; it could be a $51 billion market by 2023. Shoppers propelling the growing circular economy are Millennials and Gen Zers — the 18- to 37-year-old population — who are purchasing about 2.5 times more than any other age group.

Big box stores, like JCPenney and Macy’s, have seen their sales yo-yo in recent years and have signed on with thredUP. In doing so, the retailers have three options: store pop-up, online collaboration or a loyalty program.

Some experts believe department stores will lean toward pop-ups, because they tend to attract more shoppers. As reported by Forbes, pop-ups offered by thredUP will be between 500 and 1,000 square feet and “feature new items on a weekly basis, offering brands that aren’t already in a typical Macy’s or JCPenney. There will be 100 pop-ups by Labor Day.”

According to Reinhart, the loyalty program has been the top option, where shoppers can purchase items from thredUP’s retail partners and also receive a “clean out kit.” Buyers use this kit to send in pre-loved clothing items to thredUP — thredUP retains the markup on resold items, consumers get credits and bonuses with the retailer and the retailer sees improved customer retention. It’s a win-win-win.

thredUP has reportedly received more than $300 million in total funding for the project. It’s possible that thredUP’s RAAS initiative may help grow the circular economy and give struggling department stores a brighter future.",United States,2019.09

518,SB’19 Montevideo: The Road to a Healthy World Is Paved with ‘Transformative Promises’,"Jaqueline Pels takes us ""from an era of change ...""

First, Jaqueline Pels, director of the think tank Espacio Negocios Inclusivos (Space for Inclusive Businesses) at Universidad Torcuato Di Tella in Buenos Aires, kicked us off by explaining what it would take for us to move from an era of change to a change of era — and why that is needed.

Whereas an era of change is comprised of incremental changes, a change of era is characterized by radical transformation. She cited examples in a number of categories:
• Geopolitical — elimination of certain codes that don’t apply anymore (ex: US vs Communism/Cold War)
• Technological — we’re moving from an industrial era to a knowledge era; we’re not sure yet what tech will emerge and which will disappear
• Financial — with the rise of cryptocurrency and other alternate currencies such as Facebook’s Libra, what will be the role of government in the economy?

A change of era, Pels explained, has three features:
• Uncertainty: Easier to know what will not happen than what (ex: Christopher Columbus was so certain about where he was going, and yet …)
• Systemic vs sequential thinking: we need to see/understand how elements interact
• We need to be patient — this will take a long time

In essence, we need to tuck in and break away from dichotomic thinking, as we prepare to shift into La Era del Proposito — the “Era of Purpose.”

From there, a major theme of the day was emerging models for healthier economies — some of which are already proving their worth.

Maria Jose Gonzalez, an environmental engineer and public sector consultant, explored ways in which Uruguay is making what she calls “a necessary conversion” — to that of a circular economy.

As Gonzalez pointed out, our current situation — a combination of worsening resource scarcity + waste management issues + environmental pressures + climate change — is one that answers its own question if we look to nature as a model. She is coordinator of Proyecto Biovalor — a 4-year project of the Uruguayan government exploring the transformation of waste generated from agricultural, agro-industrial and small population centers, into energy and/or other value-added products, in order to develop a sustainable model of low emissions. Gonzalez pointed to a project turning grape must — a waste byproduct from wine production (in this case, tannat) — in Uruguay into a nutritious, versatile flour as a perfect example of circular economy in practice.

Alejandro Sewrjugin discusses ""Blockchain: toward an economy based on purpose, with a human perspective""

Speaking of future economies, cryptoeconomist Alejandro Sewrjugin is founder of PHIEconomy — an organization bringing together technology and economics to create a cryptoeconomic new theory of value — argued that through use of new currencies such as blockchain, we can create an economy of purpose from a human perspective

He used Julia Roberts’ commanding turn as Mother Nature in Conservation International’s “Nature Is Speaking” series to remind us that “we need to leave our egos behind and stop taking things for granted, reconsider why we do what we do every day.”

What happens if we go from a resource-based economy to a people-based economy, one governed by empathy? We need to incorporate human technology

We need to radically transform our notion of value to redefine our economic system (as Einstein said: we can’t solve problems with the same thinking that created them) — the SDGs are a good guide, Sewrjugin said.

We all chase money, Sewrjugin said, but we’ve never questioned its value — we just trust the issuers (government). Blockchain, on the other hand, is a public, decentralized system — a secure, traceable, person-to-person exchange with no intermediaries. Its purpose was to create a system to connect people outside the banking system — the first real, human-backed currency.

He pointed to a host of alternative currencies that have emerged — including SolarCoin, CureCoin, the Royal Bank’s Learning Coin, VeganCoin, FoodCoin and the LGBT Token — eschewing mainstream financial institutions in the name of addressing different human issues.

Towards the end of the day, Maria Laura Tinelli — director at impact investment firm Acrux Partners — turned the topic once again to new economic models, and how impact investment is co-creating a new version of capitalism.

Everyone always remembers Adam Smith talking about the ‘invisible hand of the market’ in The Wealth of Nations, she said, but that concept was mentioned once; he also says a system can’t grow if there is an imbalance of elements, in which one part of the system harms another. In other words, a merely economic view is of no use.

Fortunately, more than 2,400 institutional investors around the world have adopted ESG issues into their analysis — the GIIN estimates $502 billion in investment opportunities, and that’s growing 17 percent per year.

Rather than The Wealth of Nations, Tinelli suggests that Smith’s The Theory of Moral Sentiments — which investigates the flip side of economic self-interest: the interest of the greater good — be required reading.

Coca-Cola's Soledad Izquierdo describes water issues the company is working to address: ""3 in 10 people don't have access to clean drinking water; 6 in 10 people lack sanitation services.""

Soledad Izquierdo — VP of Public Policy, Communications and Sustainability; South Latin Business Unit at Coca-Cola — shared how the soda behemoth has redesigned itself as a comprehensive beverage company, and its progress to date on the three pillars of its sustainability work:
• community, particularly women’s empowerment — as Izquierdo pointed out, we still need 77 years for women to reach financial equality; Coca-Cola want to empower 5 million women by 2020 — they’re at 3.7 million. The company is also raising awareness with consumers re sugar intake, and adding more healthy alternative beverages with low to no sugar.
• packaging — Coca-Cola is responsible for helping to solve the plastic pollution crisis; PET represents 60 percent of plastic pollution. The company’s ‘World Without Waste’ goals include recycling all of its packaging by 2030, and redesigning packaging with as little material as possible; great progress in Uruguay — a new type of bottle has been in use there for a while
• water — climate change is adding to the water- and sanitation-access problems around the world. Coca-Cola has committed to ensuring efficient water use in production; protecting water basins, improving water capture and ecosystems and, improving storage and water quality wherever it operates.

Then, Karen Vizental — VP of Sustainable Business and Communications for Latin America and Southern Cone at Unilever — discussed how purpose-driven brands grow, from one of the companies that probably knows best: For the past few years, Unilever’s growing stable of “Sustainable Living Brands” has been demonstrating the business case for embedding sustainability into brand propositions. Unilever’s now 28 Sustainable Living Brands, which include 7 of the company’s top 10 brands, continually outperform the rest; in 2018, they grew 69 percent faster than the rest of the business, compared to 46 percent in 2017;

As new CEO Alan Jope has been quoted as saying: “It is not about putting purpose ahead of profits; it is purpose that drives profits.”

How to communicate ‘better,’ better

Goodvertising guru Thomas Kolster acknowledged that, while many brands are doing better — in terms of using their power for good and communicating about it — many are now also falling into what he calls The Hero Trap (the subject of his new book, coming out at the end of the year), in which advertisers still focus their messaging on how well they’re doing vs focusing on the consumer and what the brand can change for them. As Kolster asserted, no brand is greater than what it can make people achieve (mic drop).

Brands no longer have the power; people do, he said. 43 percent of young people today believe individuals, rather than companies, will be most effective at solving today’s social and environmental challenges. And while that may be true, there’s still a huge gap between intention and action: 65 percent of people say they want to buy better products, but only 26 percent do. So, why rely on companies to make everything better, when we’re not following through? We need to focus on changing ourselves and our own behavior — we don’t have to start out perfect, just continually improving.

Which goes back to brands: Kolster no longer believes in brand ‘purpose’ — he believes in transformative promises. He now asks brands four questions:
• What do you do?
• How (in what unique way) do you deliver your product or service?
• Who can you help people become?
• When do you enable this change?

He used a South African healthcare company with a program called Vitality, which incentivizes people to live healthier lives, as an example of a company that’s delivering on its transformative brand promise — and challenges more brands to start thinking in this way.

Later, Dr. Sirikul “Nui” Laukaikul, also known as The Brandbeing Consultant, introduced the Uruguayan audience to the concepts of a sufficiency economy and “karma marketing,” which incorporates Buddhist principles into brand strategy and messaging.

In her work with brands, she tells them that their brand is more than their reputation — it’s the central organizing thought for a business. If Buddhism is about knowing yourself (mindfulness), branding is about knowing your value (mindfulness of business)

As Nui pointed out, to live a Good Life isn’t easy — but to deliver the Good Life is even harder. Her definition of a “sustainable brand” involves the act of knowing yourself/your brand, understanding your values and learning to deliver it to others.

Karma = action. The Law of karma states that whatever one sows, one reaps. Good/bad karma leads to good/bad living — that is the law of consequence.

Where she characterizes conventional marketing as fundamentally manipulative, taking advantage of ignorance; karma marketing — or mindful/responsible marketing, where what you’re marketing creates some benefit for society — is an attempt to flip that and use marketing to create positive impacts.

She advised brands to start by appealing to consumers’ selfish needs to gain attention, then expose them to the true value of your brand/others/nature — first, understand their desires and then awaken them to reality.

We need to change our KPIs from ‘more’ to ‘moderation’ or balance, known in Buddhism as the ‘middle path.’ In a perfect world, brands would aim to deliver contentment — being happy with what you have.

Where 'purpose' is (or should be) headed

Later that afternoon, Nui and Thomas Kolster sat down for a “living room” chat (imagine your living room booked to capacity) about purpose and where it is (or should be) headed.

As Nui pointed out, purpose is why you exist. We don’t exist to make profit, we exist to help others — a principle rooted in Buddhism and any other philosophy you can think of. Purpose is a compass, she said — it will lead you to passion, to a destination. Purpose and passion are both critical for life — for people and for brands.

The whole point of life, she says, is to live a Good Life. It goes back to the sufficiency economy philosophy — based on moderation (you can have luxury, drink wine, etc; just in moderation), which should be a parameter for aspirations for a Good Life.

Whereas achieving profit makes you feel successful, helping people makes you feel valuable; if you work without a shared purpose, there’s no real impact.

Kolster, on the other hand, said where brands are concerned, “purpose” is a word that’s become too big for its own good. He says companies should find ways to make meaningful connections with their customers, rather than focus on finding/espousing their ‘purpose.’

They both agreed that it’s not enough to create a campaign — brands need to follow through and see the impacts/change made from their sustainability/purpose initiatives. And the human element must be the focus of all brand efforts going forward, including breaking down complex sustainability speak into simpler, more relatable terms.

Nui said in closing: “To deliver the Good Life, don’t just do it for the brand; but use the brand to empower others.”",United States,2019.09
520,3 Trends Reducing the CRE Carbon Footprint,"A new report issued by the Urban Land Institute’s Greenprint Center for Building Performance that measured and tracked the performance of 8,916 properties across 32 countries owned by Greenprint members shows a 17 percent improvement in energy use intensity over the past decade, among other metrics. These results keep these members on track to reduce carbon emissions by 50 percent by 2030, the report finds.

Read Also: How Fighting Climate Change Can Increase Profits

The Greenprint performance report spotlights three trends that are helping real estate owners reduce their carbon footprint while maintaining healthy revenue streams: the shift towards a circular economy, climate legislation and environmentally conscious investment.

Currently, we are living in a linear economy, also known as ‘take-make-dispose’ plan. Specifically, raw materials are used to make a product, which after use is simply thrown away. Include here the packaging, the product with the shortest life span.

The current linear economy has elements that have been made circular: raw material extraction, increased recycling, changing business models from product to service and new methods of financing. Sustainability does indeed exist in a linear economy, but its focus is to maximize the economic gain with a minimized environmental impact. Moreover, by circulating matter and energy through the economy, the demand for “new” input is decreased and the speed at which the entropy increases is delayed.

The circular economy is designed after the ‘reduce-reuse-recycle’ plan: materials extraction is reduced, products are made of reused parts and materials, and after discarding a product, materials and parts are recycled. Value retention can be achieved by keeping material streams as pure as possible during the complete value chain. A 100 percent closed-loop circular economy is not possible. The second law of thermodynamics demonstrates that matter has the tendency to dissipate, in other words, there will always be value loss.

Low-carbon construction materials can help mitigate a company’s embodied carbon. For example, using timber framing structures in lieu of or to significantly reduce the use of concrete and steel, both of which have high-carbon manufacturing processes. Buildings made of mass timber products such as cross-laminated timber have strength and stability comparable to steel and concrete while also storing carbon absorbed by the trees while growing.

An increasing number of cities have set energy benchmarking policies for buildings. In the U.S., for example, at least 31 cities have set rigorous climate goals that will affect building performance overall–from costs during development through operations and eventually, transactions. Of these, 15 cities require that structures meet performance targets or undertake additional actions like energy audits. This number is expected to grow as 287 U.S. cities and counties have signed onto the We Are Still In pledge to remain in the Paris Climate Accord.

Leading the way in addressing carbon emissions in real estate are California, New York City, Washington, D.C and the United Kingdom.

California’s Energy Efficiency Strategies Plan set goals for all new residential construction to achieve net-zero energy by 2020, all new commercial construction to be NZE by 2030 and 50 percent of commercial buildings to retrofit to NZE by 2030. Santa Monica took things a step further and enacted a net-zero building code in October 2016 and Berkeley mandated in July 2019 that all new buildings be all-electric.

New York City has passed Law 97, as part of the city’s larger 2019 Climate Mobilization Act and sets carbon emissions limit for the commercial buildings sector. By 2024 and 2030 deadlines, buildings must reduce their emissions below limits set by property type. Failure to comply with this legislation will result in fines estimated to be as high as $2 per square foot.

Washington, D.C.’s new Clean Energy DC law expands the mandatory benchmarking program to all buildings larger than 10,000 square feet and building energy performance standards are currently being developed. Buildings that fail to meet these standards by 2020 will have five years to improve their energy performance, follow a prescriptive improvement plan, or pay significant fines.

The United Kingdom passed a law in 2018 that targets commercial properties with an energy performance rating of F or G (on a scale from A to G, with G being the worst). These will no longer be re-leased. By 2020, the requirements will apply to both new and existing leases in residential properties, and by 2023, the same requirements will apply to commercial leases. Currently, about 18 percent of commercial properties and 10 percent of residential properties in England and Wales are in the F or G categories, which means that about $838 billion in asset value will be unrentable, according to the report’s analysts.

Real estate investors are increasingly asking real estate owners and asset managers for more information on their real estate funds’ environmental, social and governance programs before determining their investment strategy. ESG initiatives are perceived as material to long-term investment returns and as a consequence, an increasing number of real estate organizations are reporting on their portfolio’s environmental performance.

The most common initiatives are the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark, the Carbon Disclosure Project, Global Reporting Initiative and Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure. According to the ULI report, investor interest in ESG varies by geography, led by Australian investors and followed by European and U.S. coastal investors.",United States,2019.09
521,Finalist interviews: CEFLEX shares its perspectives on the eve of the Sustainability Awards ceremony,"The countdown is on for the live Sustainability Awards 2019 ceremony, where we will unveil the worthy winners of the most prestigious sustainability competition for packaging innovation.

In anticipation, we explore the 25 standout solutions that made it to the finals, handpicked by our independent, expert judging panel.

The winners in each category and overall 2019 Sustainability Awards winner will be announced at FachPack, Nuremberg, Germany on 25th September. Join us from 16:30 at FachPack’s PackBox Forum for sustainability discussion, networking, drinks and the big reveal.

We kick off (in no particular order!) by finding out more from a finalist in the Best Practice category: CEFLEX - Driving towards the Circular Economy for Flexible Packaging.

Congratulations on being selected as a Sustainability Awards 2019 finalist! Could you please introduce your successful initiative?

The CEFLEX initiative has set out to make flexible packaging used in Europe circular and sustainable. We are doing this by working with representative companies and associations from the whole value chain and together designing flexible packaging so that it is circular by design and better end of life collection, sorting and recycling systems and infrastructure to ensure that it is collected sorted and recycled AND that the recycled materials find sustainable end market applications where it can substitute virgin plastics.

What are the environmental challenges in packaging that your entry addresses, and how well is the market responding to them so far?

The main challenge is to make Flexible packaging even more resource efficient through better collection, sorting and recycling so that the materials stay in the circular economy. Better collection is also essential to prevent these materials leaking into the natural environment to potentially become marine litter. CEFLEX has developed D4ACE guidelines (Designing for a circular economy) which are being endorsed by the whole 130+ CEFLEX stakeholders and are already being implemented.

‘Sustainable packaging’ is a contentious concept, which means different things to different people, and anyone working in packaging understands that it’s easy to make things worse according to one environmental metric while making improvements according to another. In your opinion should there be a hierarchy among our sustainability goals?

In today’s world, for non-renewable materials like plastic derived from fossil sources need to be both circular and sustainable. This gives equal weight to the overall environmental impact as it does to ensuring the material management system is economically viable whilst ensuring that these non-renewable resources are circular, i.e. returned to the economy after they have been used.

Clearly, sustainability in packaging needs to be achieved by many stakeholders acting together, not by someone with a silver bullet. Thinking about the wider picture, what areas of innovation or action would you like to see across the value chain in the coming years to meet the demands of nature and society?

CEFLEX recognises the importance of broad representation from the entire flexible packaging value chain including end of life and is fortunate enough to be able to count on the support of more than 130 companies and associations who are participating in the CEFLEX initiative.

Whilst this number continues to increase, the CEFLEX “Vision”, “Roadmap” and deliverables such as the D4ACE guidelines will be made available to all value chain participants including those not formally participating in the project.",United States,2019.09

While apparel production has increased, the time clothing is worn has fallen, resulting in much waste which ends up in landfills,” Sri Lankan media reports quoted Hirdaramani as telling a forum for fashion industry students and officials from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in the United States recently.The group is part of a global project to redesign jeans to make their manufacturing sustainable by 2021.Hirdaramani said their efforts focus on garment durability, material health, recyclability, and traceability.The group employs about 20,000 people in factories across the island and provides apparel design, production and delivery services to some of the world’s top fashion and clothing brands.",United States,2019.09
526,K 2019 Preview: Blow Molding Exhibits Focus on Recycling & PET,"With a relatively small number of blow molding machinery exhibitors willing to provide advance information, it’s difficult to discern the major trends. However, two themes stand out from data available: First, “Circular Economy” or recycling, the overarching theme of the show, will be featured in blow molding exhibits, too. Second, exhibits of PET blowing systems apparently will far outnumber those for polyolefins, PVC and other thermoplastics.

“Circular Economy” is central to Kautex’s exhibit at K. An all-electric KBB60 machine will mold a three-layer bottle from Braskem’s “I’m green” HDPE derived from sugarcane. The middle layer will be PCR consisting of foamed Braskem “green” PE. These bottles produced at the show will be reclaimed by Erema at its “Circonomic Centre” in the area outside the exhibit halls.

KHS is being a touch mysterious in saying it will present a “new PET concept” based on a juice bottle as an example. The company revealed few details, saying only that “it combines individual environmentally friendly packaging solutions in one container and thereby supports the theory of circular economy,” adding that this new PET bottle, to be presented for the first time at the K show, was designed to have “the smallest possible ecological footprint.” At the same time, this “new approach ensures a high level of product protection and a longer shelf life, in particular for sensitive beverages.” Further, KHS says it has formed a partnership with an “environmental service provider” to pursue its “strategy of reduction, recycling and reuse.”

Agr International is known for its monitoring and control solutions for PET stretch-blow molding. At K, it will show “its latest and most powerful in-the-blowmolder vision system,” Pilot Vision+. In keeping with the Circular Economy theme, this system is said to be well suited to quality management of PET bottles with high recycled (rPET) content. It can manage up to six cameras for defect detection inside the stretch-blow machine. Color preform cameras can detect color variations, while the large screen displays defects categorized by mold/spindle and defect type.

Agr also highlights sustainability in showing its latest Process Pilot control system with advanced thinwall capability, introduced earlier this year. It’s recommended particularly for ultralight PET bottles, as it measures and adjusts material distribution on every bottle.

Among other exhibits of PET machinery, Nissei ASB will demonstrate its new “Zero Cooling” technology that promises an average of 50% higher productivity as well as higher quality PET bottles. They key is using the second of four stations in its rotary injection stretch-blow machines for both cooling and preform conditioning. Thus, cooling of one shot overlaps with injection of the next shot. Ability to use thicker preforms with higher stretch ratios—without sacrificing cycle time—reportedly leads to stronger bottles with fewer cosmetic flaws (see May Keeping Up).

Meanwhile, FlexBlow (a brand of Terekas in Lithuania) will introduce a special “Beauty” series of its two-stage stretch-blow machines for the cosmetic containers market. It is designed to offer versatility for a variety of container shapes and neck sizes in short-run production. Complete changeover from oval narrow-neck bottles to shallow wide-mouth jars is said to take 30 min. Further, FlexBlow’s special pick-and-place system reportedly can feed any wide-mouth preform, even shallow shapes, while minimizing scratches on the preforms.

1Blow of France will be running its most popular compact two-stage machine, the two-cavity 2LO, with three new options. One is a Preferential & Offset Heating Technology Kit, which adds flexibility for producing “extreme oval containers”—even in opaque colors, and significantly offset-neck bottles once thought impossible to make by the reheat stretch-blow process. Second, a tiered-access system limits operator access to particular control functions—as little as on/off and screen-viewing access—while granting technicians full access. Third, in-machine leak testing is now available through cooperation with Delta Engineering. Delta’s UDK 45X leak tester uses high voltage to rapidly detect and reject containers with micro-cracks, while saving floor space and capital cost.

Jomar, a leading maker of injection-blow machines, is making an entry into non-stretched PET with its TechnoDrive 65 PET machine at K. Based on the high-speed TechnoDrive 65 unit introduced last year, this 65-ton model is aimed specifically at PET but can easily convert to run polyolefins and other resins with a change of screw and some minor adjustments.

Features tailored for PET include a more robust screw motor, high-pressure valves and built-in nozzle heaters. Some injection-blow machines require a fourth station to process PET. It’s used to temperature-condition the core rods. But the new three-station Jomar machine accomplishes this task in the ejection station, reportedly minimizing cycle times. Since injection-blown PET bottles average about 1 mm wall thickness, this machine is said to be suited to jars, vials and bottles for pharmaceuticals or cosmetics, rather than beverage bottles. At the show, it will mold eight 50-m perfume bottles.

For production of unusually shaped technical items, such as automotive ducts and appliance piping, ST BlowMoulding of Italy will highlight its new ASPI 200 accumulator-head suction blow molder, a smaller version of the ASPI 400 model shown at NPE2018. It’s designed to process both polyolefins and engineering resins for either complex 3D shapes or conventional 2D parts. Its hydraulic pumps have energy-saving VFD motors. To see the machine in action, the company offers to bus visitors from the fair to a training and service center in Bonn, Germany.

For packaging, both Graham Engineering and Wilmington Machinery will display their latest wheel machines—Graham’s Revolution MVP and Wilmington’s Series III B.

Industry 4.0 will also get its due at K. Kautex will be emphasizing its “new digital solutions in customer service.” It previously introduced remote troubleshooting, but is now augmenting it with ability for teams of experts to examine directly a malfunctioning or underperforming machine in a virtual environment. Kautex has also set up a new customer portal for ordering replacement parts. Kautex Spare Parts will allow users to check availability and prices and post orders.

For training purposes, Kautex’s virtual-machine control simulators have been enhanced to require operators to react appropriately to process changes. An error-free part is displayed only if the machine settings are correct.",United States,2019.09
527,"K 2019 Preview: Resins & Additives for Sustainability in Cars, Electronics & Packaging","The “Circular Economy” will be the dominant theme at the K 2019 show, Oct. 16-23, in Düsseldorf, Germany. Leading suppliers of materials and additives have all upped their focus on sustainability, evidenced by their adoption of a variety of new technologies—including new product formulations that lead to circular solutions (i.e., recycling) and reduce plastic waste. It underscores their commitment to the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals to address pressing issues—including energy and greenhouse gas reduction, solutions to environmental degradation, water conservation, and material efficiency.

Actions undertaken by materials suppliers include chemical recycling, advanced mechanical recycling, incorporation of biobased feedstocks, recycle-content resins with performance equivalent to their virgin counterparts, as well as plastic formulations that are easier to recycle and/or are lighter in weight yet offer optimal performance, ranging from packaging to automotive and electronic parts.

Consistent with the “circular” theme, additives suppliers are addressing sustainability with colorants and additives that are more environmentally friendly or have bio content, allow for easier recyclability, and reduce material waste.

Visitors can expect to see new engineered thermoplastics that meet key trends in automotive, including electrification of vehicles and automated driving, E&E, packaging, and healthcare.

Industry partnerships characterize several efforts being undertaken by materials suppliers. Recently reported industry collaborations include LyondellBasell and producer of renewable hydrocarbons Neste, which announced the first parallel production of bio-based PP and LDPE at a commercial scale; and Dow and BioLogiQ, which are evaluating potential synergies between the latter’s NuPlastiQ plant-based biopolymer and Dow’s PE resins.

SABIC will address using bio-renewable and recycled feedstocks and designing lightweight packaging to extend shelf life of food, as well as solutions for reuse and recycling of industrial packaging through innovative processes and partner collaborations

The company is reportedly first in the industry to scale up a chemical recycling process for transforming mixed plastic waste back to new polymers, enabling downstream customers to develop high quality, recyclable product designs.

New solutions from SABIC for lightweighting are Cohers S ethylene-octene plastomer for film to enhance heat sealing, clarity, toughness and elasticity; and PP-UMS (ultra-melt-strength) to trim weight through foaming in automotive, packaging and building/construction.

Borealis is now owner of two recycling companies: mtm, a German recycler of rigid packaging, produces PCR-PP & PE for injection molding (e.g., paint pails—100% rPP and caps for non-food use—25% rPP); and Ecoplast, Austrian recycler of flexible package for reuse in film (e.g., 100% PCR garbage liner). The company will showcase its Borcycle recycling process, jointly developed with recycling machinery maker Erema. It is said to optimizes each step in the recycling process to produce higher quality recycle than is typical.

Through mtm, new and improved recycled products will be highlighted by Borealis, including Borcycle MF1981SY, 80+% rPP plus 10% talc and Borealis Queo metallocene low-density PE plastomer (octene copolymer) as an impact modifier. This the first of a range of rPP grades, which boast a good stiffness/toughness balance, and targeted for use in visible black parts, such as small appliances.

The company will also show significant improvements to existing recycled Purpolen polyolefin grades, also made by mtm, including: PP Y40, an rPP with improved flow—raised to 40 g/10 min for injection molding thin-wall parts with long flow paths for pails, thick-wall packaging and appliance parts. PE FF is a fine-filtered PE (0.950 density) boasts reduced gel level and quality comparable to virgin for general-purpose applications. And PE Y01 is 100% PCR with low MFR and low gels for extrusion of pipe or blowing large bottles.

Nova Chemicals will highlight six new virgin PE grades (LL and MD) capable of accepting 20% or more recycle and also said to be themselves “more friendly to recycling.”

Ineos Styrolution is exploring various avenues toward achieving circular styrenics solutions. This includes PS chemical-recycling technology and the launch of new recycle-content PS grades.

Ascend Performance Materials will discuss new customized recycle-content nylon 66 to meet increasing demand.

BASF will highlight its certified-compostable ecovio resins, which now comprise a portfolio for applications from mulch films to fruit and vegetable bags and organic waste bags, which can be used throughout the entire food cycle.

Other engineering thermoplastic suppliers, like Lanxess, Covestro and Solvay are all working toward establishing closed-loop material cycles in the manufacture and application of their materials. A number of pilot projects are underway with customers and other industry partners.

Similar actions are taking place in additives. Milliken’s Plastics Additives group will highlight its partnership with Chicago-based PureCycle Technologies to advance closed-loop recycling of PP. Using technology developed and licensed by Procter & Gamble Co., PureCycle plans to open in Ohio by 2021 its first plant employing a patented recycling method that restores virgin-like quality to waste PP.

Clariant is expanding its EcoTain label, currently awarded to more than 200 products that show outstanding sustainability advantages, to include EcoTain Partnerships that will foster collaboration between at least three partners in the value chain to create concrete sustainability and business impacts and advance environmental protection and the circular economy. At K 2019, Clariant will issue an open invitation to companies to come together and collaborate on one particularly challenging aspect of recycling.

BASF will highlight UV stabilizers and pigments that have good performance in recycled plastics and/or sorting of recycled plastics.

Songwon will show how technological expertise enables the development of materials that can help customers tackle a wide variety of environmental issues, including stabilizers that make plastics more durable, allowing easier recyclability and reducing waste.

BASF will launch Ultramid Advanced T2000, the latest addition to its PPA portfolio. Based on nylon 6T/66, it is said to combine excellent mechanical and dielectric strengths at high temperatures, a combination particularly crucial for E&E connectors. This PPA reportedly shows improved impact strength on par with standard nylon 66 and lower water uptake than standard aliphatic nylons. Comprising about 10 grades, T2000 is also a versatile candidate for automotive metal replacement such as water-outlet valves, water pumps, fuel-system components, actuators, transmission sensors and clutch parts.

Covestro will present a new interior concept for the “future car,” which it says will be a multifunctional, mobile living and working space. Covestro will highlight “smart materials” for new interiors, including new Makrolon PC grades and blends said to enable a range of glass-like surfaces and functional colors, critical for integration of innovative displays, sensors, cameras and ambient lighting systems.

Covestro will also showcase Makrolon PC films for printed 3D, large-scale cover plates for integrated displays. The films also serve as carrier for printed electronics in touchscreens for cars, whose use will increase drastically, Covestro says, with increasing digitalization and networking, as well as the trend towards autonomous driving. Seamless integration of displays is also supported by the firm’s new generation of Makrolon AI PC materials.

PC resins and blends are also candidates for 5G technology. Covestro will show a series of technical and design 5G antenna prototypes for small cells in the frequency range of 3.5 GHz and 28 GHz. Covestro will also show new films

for 5G smartphones. A Makrofol SR PC/PMMA multilayer film (with acrylic as the outside layer) combined with a new manufacturing process results in cellphone back covers that look like glass but are not fragile. This crystal-clear, 3D-formable and 5G-compatible film meets requirements for transmission at high radio frequencies with wavelengths in the millimeter range and is engineered for optimal design freedom to create fashionable mobile phones with decoration technologies such as UV patterning and non-conductive vacuum metalization.

Lanxess’ High Performance Materials (HPM) business unit will be launching a range of materials for electric mobility. The use of the color orange to identify live, plastic-sheathed components is becoming well-established in electric vehicles, but it is a challenge to develop orange compounds that exhibit high color stability over the long term. New HPM nylon 6 and PBT compounds for high-voltage applications will be colored in the highly vivid RAL 2003 (Lanxess color code 200849) tone. Another color variant is almost ready to be introduced.

Among the first to feature this new orange color are the glass-reinforced, halogen-free flame-retardant nylon 6 compounds Durethan BKV20FN01, BKV30FN04 and BKV45FN04. The latter meets UL 94V-0 at thickness of 0.4 mm. Also new is the hydrolysis-stabilized, glass-reinforced PBT Pocan BF4232HR. Colored orange, it also achieves 94V-0 classification at 0.4 mm. Other new HPM products prevent electrical corrosion upon contact with live metal parts; and there are halogen-free, flame-retardant materials for battery cell holders and cover plates.

In terms of lightweight design, Lanxess is working primarily on thermoplastic composites based on its Tepex prepregs. At K, look for a seat shell and highly integrated front-end carrier, both said to exhibit excellent crash resistance.

Also new from Lanxess are nylon and PBT compounds for cost-effective blow-molding of components for air management in turbocharged combustion engines and/or liners for vehicles powered by hydrogen and natural gas.

Ascend Performance Materials will highlight several new Vydyne nylon 66 grades, including high-temperature nylons for automotive; the company’s first long-chain nylon 66 grades for extruded fuel and brake lines; and flame-retardant grades for electrical applications.

Borealis will feature new grades of Fibremod Carbon compounds for automotive, including CG210SY, 20% carbon fiber in PP with improcws surface and dimensional stability; and CD211SY, a high-flow “hybrid” of 10% carbon fiber, 10% talc in PP.

SABIC has been working with leading automotive OEMs toward development of “breakthrough” plastic and metal replacement solutions. At K 2019, SABIC will feature new concepts for vehicle electrification involving conductive PC and PP.

INEOS Styrolution will unveil an expanded line of StyLight styrenic copolymer composites for automotive, ranging from seat structures, door carriers, and front-end modules to body panels and exterior and interior parts with a carbon fiber look. Also new is a high-flow ABS for auto interior and exterior parts, electronic housings, and medical devices like inhalers.

Polyplastics will showcase new Duracon polyacetals (POM) for automotive, including grades for injection molded fuel-system components. Also new is a high-flow/high-rigidity acetal with MFR around 14, suited to wide range of molding conditions. Yet another new grade is said to combine high strength with good creep and sliding properties.

New from Polyplastics for electric vehicles are Durafide PPS and Duranex PBT targeted for peripheral engine parts such as power-control units to deliver high insulating properties, reduce water absorption, and meet harsh operating conditions.

Kraiburg TPE will unveil new compounds with optimized odor and emission behavior for auto interiors and consumer products, and TPEs with enhanced UV resistance and adhesion to plastics like ASA and PMMA for auto exteriors. Also on tap at K will be custom-engineered thermoplastic hybrids (TEHs) that provide superior chemical and thermal resistance.

DSM, active in additive manufacturing (AM) for over 25 years, will outline opportunities for AM at automotive OEMs--from producing vehicles in low volumes to incorporating individual customer requirements and tastes, and also production of spare parts. The latter is an area with huge potential, as it could help reduce inventory, typically at least 7% of an automotive OEM’s liquid assets, and also result in cost-cutting and carbon-footprint reduction.

BASF has extended its Ultradur PBT portfolio with what is said to be the first PBT for extrusion, B6551 LNI; and the first for thermoforming, B6560 M2 FC TF. Up to now the melt strength of PBT was not sufficient to make it a preferred product for extrusion. By connecting and branching the polymer chains via tailor-made additives, BASF gained very high melt strength. This reportedly makes B6551 LNI well suited for pipes, profiles and mandrels. And B6560 M2 FC TF competes for extrusion of films and thermoforming of packaging or technical parts.

Kraiburg TPE will launch two custom-engineered compound series with significantly better migration control than common TPEs. They are particularly suited for closure systems, valves and seals for packaging with direct contact to foods that contain fat.

Wacker will be presenting its new Elastosil LR 5040 liquid silicone rubber (LSR) series. Even without post-cure, this LSR shows excellent mechanical properties and meets strict regulatory requirements for sensitive applications in the baby care, food and medical technology. Wacker will present a live injection molding demo with the new LR5040 on a KraussMaffei machine.

Solvay will show its new thermoplastic composites for aerospace, automotive, and oil and gas. Beyond lightweighting, these materials reportedly feature exceptional heat and shock resistance, strength, toughness and chemical inertness.

Also new from Solvay is reportedly an industry-first high-temperature PEEK. Also showcased will be unique applications of the company’s long-fiber thermoplastic (LFT) materials, such as the world’s first all-polymer recyclable e-bike.

Evonik Industries, which this year marked the 40th anniversary of its Vestamid nylon 12 elastomer (PEBA), will introduce a new member of the product line--a popular, trusted material, especially in the athletic equipment industry. It boasts transparency and gloss levels that give designers far more freedom than they have ever had with PEBA.

Solvay is launching Alve-One foaming solutions, an innovative generation of high-performance and cost-effective chemical blowing agents based on “100% safe” ingredients for a range of resins, including PVC, EVA and polyolefins. These formulations reportedly have no negative impact on human respiratory health and are safe for workers to handle without compromising efficiency and performance in plastic foaming.

A next-generation Tinuvin NOR HALS light and heat stabilizer will be highlighted by BASF. The company will also unveil new pigments, including two new Lumina Royal effect pigments: Russet enables new vibrant, high-chroma red shades and provides greater formulation flexibility; and Amber, which promises strong sparkle for attractive bronze, orange, golden and red effect shades.

Also new from BASF, Microlen Piano Black is said to enable the deepest and most enduring black and outstanding dispersion for high-end plastic design. And there are new black and red pigments recommended for recycling and other demanding applications. Due to its high heat and chemical stability, Sicopal Red K 3050 FK reportedly stands up to the most demanding applications, including engineering plastics. Building on the Sicopal Black technology, this new addition boasts best-in-class near-infrared (NIR) reflective properties, and addresses the current industry need for recyclable black plastics that can pass through infrared sorting at materials recycling facilities.

Lanxess’ Inorganic Pigments business will present a black pigment that reflects the infrared portion of sunlight 20% more effectively than conventional black pigments. Plastic roofs and facades offer a wealth of potential for use in reducing temperatures inside buildings.

With a partner that makes NIR scanners , Clariant developed new black colorants that can be identified by NIR sorting devices. These blacks can be used for various polymers and applications such as packaging and E&E.

Also notable from Clariant are pigments designed for coloring biodegradable plastics, and new halogen-free flame retardants that retain performance after the material is recycled.

Clariant will also launch a new patented oxygen-scavenger masterbatch for PET in food and beverage packaging. It is reportedly based on a new molecule that goes beyond existing solutions for PET in protecting content shelf life and taste.

Songwon is making its entry into the flame-retardant arena with synergists that reportedly can reduce flame-retardant loadings in both halogen and non-halogen formulations.

Milliken will be launching a new Hyperform HPN nucleating agent. HPN 715 is said to offer new opportunities for PP to replace more expensive engineering resins in demanding applications. It boasts an optimized balance of various key factors, while also providing higher HDT. This allows PP to be used in microwaveable containers, vehicle under-hood components and household appliances.

Perstorp will showcase its new Pevalen Pro, a renewable polyol ester, non-phthalate plasticizer for producing flexible PVC with a lower carbon footprint. Second-generation Pevalen Pro allows for up to 40% renewable content in flexible PVC and is a direct replacement for standard Pevalen with no compromise on quality and performance, making it very easy to switch, the company says.

Tolsa will showcase new Adins flame-retardant additives, such as Adins Clay synergists that reduce smoke production and improve heat release with halogen and halogen-free flame retardant systems.

Tolsa also has a new grade that uses TiO to improve the performance of intumescent systems for PP and coatings. It further stabilizes the char at dosages of around 1-2%. Key applications include transportation, pipe, coatings, and wire and cable. Another new grade is Adins Clay Sil1 for PVC and silicone formulations, said to deliver reduced heat release and smoke suppression. It serves as an alternative to antimony trioxide.",United States,2019.09
528,Pope urges politicians to take 'drastic measures' on climate change,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis challenged governments on Sunday to take “drastic measures” to combat global warming and reduce the use of fossil fuels, saying the world was experiencing a climate emergency.

Francis issued his appeal, a written message for Sunday’s World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation, ahead of the United Nations Climate Action Summit this month in New York, a follow up to the 2016 Paris Agreement to curb global warming.

Calling the U.N. summit “of particular importance,” he added:

“There, governments will have the responsibility of showing the political will to take drastic measures to achieve as quickly as possible zero net greenhouse gas emissions and to limit the average increase in global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius with respect to pre-industrial levels, in accordance with the Paris Agreement goals.”

Francis has made many calls for environmental protection and has clashed over climate change with skeptics leaders such as U.S. President Donald Trump, who has taken the United States out of the Paris accord.

“We have caused a climate emergency that gravely threatens nature and life itself, including our own,” the leader of the world’s 1.3 billon Roman Catholics said in the message for the prayer day, which is marked by various Christian Churches.

“Our prayers and appeals are directed first at raising the awareness of political and civil leaders,” he said, adding that governments should “renew commitments decisive for directing the planet towards life, not death”.

He listed constant pollution, continued use of fossil fuels, intensive agricultural exploitation and deforestation as being among the man-made causes of global warming and said the Amazon, where fires are raging, is “gravely threatened”.

“Now is the time to abandon our dependence on fossil fuels and move, quickly and decisively, towards forms of clean energy and a sustainable and circular economy,” he said.

Other phenomena, such as the melting of glaciers and the presence of plastic and microplastics in the oceans “testify to the urgent need for interventions that can no longer be postponed,” he said.

“Egoism and self-interest have turned creation, a place of encounter and sharing, into an arena of competition and conflict,” he said.

Francis, who wrote an encyclical in 2015 on environmental protection, said now was the time for people to reflect on their lifestyles, urging them not to make “thoughtless and harmful” decisions” on food, consumption and transportation.

“Too many of us act like tyrants with regard to creation,” he said.

Protection of the environment is expected to be a main these of the pope’s trip to Africa, which starts on Wednesday.",United States,2019.09
529,Pope challenges governments to take 'drastic' climate change measures,"Pope Francis Pope FrancisPope calls for cooperation on coronavirus vaccine development, international sharing The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - Trump, Congress close to deal on new coronavirus bill Pope calls for inequalities to be abolished after 'time of trial' MORE on Sunday called on world governments to take “drastic” action on climate change.

According to Reuters, he said that governments will have a ""responsibility"" at the United Nations Climate Action Summit later this month to show “the political will to take drastic measures to achieve as quickly as possible zero net greenhouse gas emissions and to limit the average increase in global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius with respect to pre-industrial levels, in accordance with the Paris Agreement goals.”

“We have caused a climate emergency that gravely threatens nature and life itself, including our own,” he said in a written message for the World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation, the news service noted.

Francis reportedly said that governments should “renew commitments decisive for directing the planet towards life, not death.”

He also said it is time to abandon fossil fuels and move toward clean energy and “a sustainable and circular economy.”

Francis has repeatedly focused on the environment. He criticized the U.S. in 2017 for pulling out of the Paris climate agreement.

On Sunday, his weekly public address was delayed because he was trapped in a Vatican elevator, Reuters noted.

He told the crowd in St. Peter’s Square that he was stuck in the elevator for 25 minutes before firefighters freed him.

“A round of applause for the fire brigade,” he said, according to the news service.",United States,2019.09

531,K 2019 Preview: Green's the Theme in Extrusion & Compounding,"Many extrusion and compounding machine builders are keeping their K 2019 plans under wraps, perhaps hoping to create a “wow” factor as attendees walk the halls in Dusseldorf next month. What follows is a rundown of new technology news gleaned by Plastics Technology though early August.

Sustainability and the Circular Economy will be a prevalent theme throughout the show. In blown film, that will be reflected in technology to produce thinner films more consistently, sometimes using biobased materials such as PLA. Reifenhauser says film processors that upgrade lines with its EVO Ultra Flat Plus technology, an inline stretching unit integrated in the haul-off that was introduced at K 2016, can downgauge PLA films by as much as 30%. What’s more, because with Ultra Flat Plus the film is stretched while it’s still warm, the line can be run at speeds comparable to those of PE film production. This is significant because, according to Reifenhauser, PLA’s inherent lack of stiffness generally slows production speeds.

Reifenhauser will also debut a laser-measurement system that is said to precisely record the topography of the web so that production parameters can be optimized automatically . ""Until now, each film manufacturer had to rely on the experience and precision of its own production technicians,” explains Eugen Friedel, sales director at Reifenhauser Blown Film. “By developing the laser measurement system, we can offer our customers more process reliability regardless of the operator. The optimization to preset parameters happens automatically in a closed control loop.""

Another trend in blown film that falls within the sustainability theme is polyolefin-dedicated (POD) multi-layer lines to produce film for standup pouches and other products that typically consisted of PE and PET laminations. Reifenhauser reports that its EVO Ultra Stretch, a machine-direction orientation (MDO) device, is being deployed by a processor making breathable backsheet films for a personal-hygiene product. Like the Ultra Flat unit, the MDO is positioned in the hauloff.

On the matter of POD lines, India’s Rajoo will run a seven-layer blown film line called Heptafoil that can switch between barrier film production and all-polyolefin processing at outputs up to about 1000 lb/hr.

In other blown film news, Davis-Standard (D-S), by virtue of its acquisitions of Gloucester Engineering Corp. (GEC) and Brampton Engineering, will be promoting its Italycs 5 blown-film control system as an upgrade for processors with lines managed by the GEC Extrol control systems. The Vector air ring, introduced by Brampton at K 2016 and displayed at NPE2018, will also be showcased. New air-control technology reportedly can improve the uncorrected film starting gauge by as much as 60-80%. The air ring also is said to provide stable air velocity, resulting in consistent cooling to minimize variations in gauge across the film width.

Also on the matter of air rings, Addex Inc. will launch Phase II of its Intensive Cooling technology at K 2019. “Intensive Cooling” is what Addex calls its “revolutionary” approach to bubble cooling. Addex’s patented design change from the common aerodynamics of present-day blown-film air rings reportedly yields dramatic increases in stability and output. Addex continues to tweak the system for even greater gains when combined with Addex’s proprietary auto-profile and IBC systems.

Addex has numerous air rings of this design in blown-film plants for both high- and low-melt-strength processes. The most popular configuration replaces the conventional dual-flow ring’s low-velocity, diffused-flow lower lip with a very high-velocity, upwardly directed and focused air stream, which is mounted flat to the die to create an entirely new lock point, about 25 mm above the die lip. The technology is sold as part of Addex’s industry-standard Laminar Flow air ring, and also in concert with Addex’s auto-profile and IBC systems. Addex guarantees a minimum of 10- 15% average increase in output rate, depending on materials being run; actual outputs have many times been much greater. It is not uncommon to see a 30% increase in output, especially for stiffer materials, and in one particular case the output increase was a whopping 80%, Addex reports.

Kuhne Anlagenbau GmbH will showcase a 13-layer Triple Bubble line producing biaxially oriented films for high-barrier food packages such as standup pouches, and high-barrier shrink film for fresh meat or cheese packaging, among other applications. The unique feature of these films is that they will be 100% recyclable. The line will be in operation at Kuhne’s plant in Sankt Augustin.

In flat film, Bruckner will introduce two completely new line concepts for the production of BOPE films (biaxially oriented polyethylene). Film processors can choose between lines with a working width of 21.6 ft and an output of 6000 lb/hr, or a working width of 28.5 ft and an output of 10,000 lb/hr. The new lines also have the flexibility to produce BOPP films.

Outside the packaging realm, Bruckner will display a new high-temperature concept for BOPP capacitor film; lines for producing “stone paper” based on 60% CaCo -filled BOPP; systems for making BOPET film for optical applications; and a line for producing biaxially oriented polyimide for flexible optical displays.

Amut will be running an ACS 2000 cast line for stretch film. It features Amut’s Q-Catcher control system, which permits previously saved process parameters to be repeated, allowing for film to be reproduced run to run with exactly the same mechanical properties. The line on display will feature five extruders in a seven-layer configuration. The line can be run at up to about 2790 ft/min and 2866 lb/hr. Film thickness ranges from 6 to 25 μ. The ACS 2000 will also feature Amut’s Essentia T Die.

Graham Engineering will showcase a Welex Evolution sheet extrusion system equipped with XSL Navigator control. While the equipment on display at K 2019 will be for thin-gauge PP, the Evolution system can be customized for widths from 36 to 90 in., gauges from 0.008 to 0.125 in., and throughputs up to 10,000 lb/hr. Monolayer or coextrusion systems are available, with up to nine extruders.

In addition to a customized roll stand, the Evolution system can also be equipped with screen changers, melt pumps, mixers, feedblocks and dies. Additional features of the line on display include a proprietary roll-skewing mechanism for thin-gauge applications, maintaining quick roll change and electric gap adjustment under full hydraulic load without interrupting production.

Kuhne will be running two Smart Sheet extrusion lines with brand-new features in Sankt Augustin during K 2019. One is for producing PET sheet; the other for thermoformable PP/PS/PE barrier sheet.

The PET line will process post-consumer reclaim (PCR) using a Liquid State Polycondensation reactor that is able to accurately control the IV value of the melt—which can be even higher than that of the original material. It will produce FDA- and EFSA (European Food Safety Authority)-compliant sheet for food packaging.

The barrier line will produce seven-layer thermoformable sheet structures for applications requiring long shelf life with what Kuhne says are tight tolerances and excellent layer distribution. The main extruder in the line is a Kuhne High Speed (KHS) extruder, which is said to reduce energy, floor space, noise, spare parts and maintenance requirements. This extruder is used for the core layer and will process regrind as well as virgin resin. The line is also furnished with a Kuhne feedblock.

Reifenhauser will be showing a feedblock of its own. The REIcofeed-Pro allows material streams to be adjusted automatically during operation.

A high-speed extruder for PET sheet will also be prominent at the Battenfeld-Cincinnati booth. Its STARextruder 120 was developed specifically for processing PET. In the extruder’s central planetary roller section, melted material is “rolled out” into very thin layers, producing an enormous melt surface for degassing and devolatilization. The STARextruder can be used to process both non-predried new materials and any kind of recycled materials, as confirmed by the FDA approval it has received.

Graham will show a variety of American Kuhne extrusion systems for medical tubing, including Ultra MD systems, compact modular extruders, and other systems such as a tri-layer tubing line. This line consists of three compact modular extruders and the XC300 Navigator control with integrated TwinCAT Scope View high-speed data-acquisition system.

Davis-Standard will display elastomer extrusion lines for both medical and automotive applications. This includes technology for producing medical-grade silicone tubes, wound drains and catheters, as well as elastomer capabilities for manufacturing hydraulic and automotive hoses and automotive seals. A new crosshead die, The Model 3000A, is said to reduce scrap and speed startup times. The crosshead offers preferred features such as a tapered mandrel and highly engineered flow paths to ensure consistent flow through all speed ranges, as well as a thrust bearing on pin adjustment to adjust wall thickness without interruption.

Also on display at the D-S booth will be extrusion systems for automotive fuel and vapor tubes, micro-drip irrigation laterals, heating and plumbing pipe, blown fiber micro-duct, medical tubes, offshore flexible pipe, custom pipe and tubing, and wire and cable.

On a profile line, Davis-Standard will showcase DS Activ-Check, billed as a “smart” technology that enables processors to take advantage of real-time predictive maintenance by providing early notifications of potential machine failures. Machine operators are alerted to issues before they happen, reducing unplanned downtime while also collecting valuable data. Users receive notifications via e-mail or text, and continuous monitoring of machine status is available on smart devices and remote PCs. Key parameters monitored include extruder gear reducer, lubrication system, motor characteristics, drive power unit, and barrel heating and cooling. The benefits of Activ-Check will be demonstrated on a profile line using Microsoft Windows 10 on an EPIC III control system.

For tight-tolerance pipe, Battenfeld-Cincinnati will be showcasing three products: its fast-dimension-change (FDC) pipe head that enables automatic pipe dimension changes during production, plus two new spider NG PVC pipe heads. The first of these tools have already been deployed at customers’ sites, and are said to be providing low material consumption and narrow tolerances. In the three-layer head, the middle layer of the pipe is guided by a mandrel-holder geometry, while the geometry of the outer layer has been completely revised. A benefit of the new geometry is its reported excellent flushing behavior, said to be a key feature in particular for manufacturing PVC pipes with a foamed middle layer, highly filled compact pipes, or pipes with a regrind middle layer. At the K show, both new spider pipe heads will be teamed with compatible extruders.

The new DTA 160 direct-cutting machine is set to be one of this booth’s biggest downstream innovations for pipe manufacturing. With the new cutting unit, both polyolefin and PVC pipes can reportedly be cut to exact length quickly, precisely and cleanly. A particular highlight of the new chipless unit is that it works entirely without hydraulics. Most importantly, this means that it weighs around 60% less than a conventional system. This enables the cutting unit to move much faster and makes it possible to work with short lengths as a result.

In compounding, Coperion will display two significantly redesigned ZSK Mc18 extruders with 45- and 70-mm screw diam. and a specific torque of 18 Nm/cm3. Optimized mechanical and electrical features provide better operating comfort and even greater efficiency. Both twin-screw extruders will be equipped with ZS-B “easy type” side feeders as well as ZS-EG “easy type” side devolatilization. Both the ZS-B and ZS-EG significantly reduce the time needed for maintenance tasks, thanks to the “easy” design that enables quick removal from and re-installation on the process section for cleaning or screw changes. Instead of three-part covers, these extruders are now equipped with single-part heat insulation covers, which are said to be very easy to handle and can be detached without removing the cartridge heaters.

The ZSK 70 Mc18 will be on display with a K3-ML-D5-V200 type vibratory feeder and an accompanying ZS-B easy with a K-ML-SFS-BSP-100 Bulk Solids Pump (BSP) feeder. The smaller ZSK 45 Mc18 will be equipped with a gravimetric K2-ML-D5-T35 twin-screw feeder and an accompanying ZS-B easy with a K-ML-SFS-KT20 twin-screw feeder for high-accuracy feeding at low feeding rates.

With the dual-bearing SP 240 strand pelletizer, Coperion Pelletizing Technology will exhibit one model from its SP series, which has been completely reworked for greatly simplified handling. Its new cutting-gap adjustment technology makes fine adjustments simpler, faster and more precise; adjustments can be done by hand, with no tools. Furthermore, it markedly reduces maintenance downtime.

KraussMaffei (formerly KraussMaffei Berstorff) will debut four new and larger sizes of its ZE Blue Power Series. From a process-engineering standpoint, the four large extruders (98, 122, 142 and 166 mm) are identical to their smaller sister models. This reportedly ensures consistent scale-up for development and processing of new formulations. The larger extruders also offer the same screw and barrel modularity. A wide range of 4D and 6D barrel sections and various side feeders and degassing units are available.

Exchangeable oval liners provide a cost-effective alternative for extremely wear-intensive processes. KraussMaffei made some minor design modifications to allow for the large size of the new extruders: The housing elements are connected by means of screw unions instead of clamping flanges, cartridge heaters are replaced by ceramic heaters, and their shape was slightly changed.

The combination of large free volume and high specific torque is said to enable “universal application” of the ZE BluePower for compounding engineering plastics and even highly filled formulations. Thanks to the 1.65 OD/ID diameter ratio, the free volume is increased by 27% over KM’s previous ZE UT extruder series. In addition, the ZE BluePower features a 36% higher torque density of 16 Nm/cm3.

Farrel Pomini will feature a Compounding Tower display at its booth, with a live demonstration of its Synergy Control System. The latter features feed-system control from the operator touchscreen; integrated control of upstream and downstream support equipment; automatic startup of downstream processes; automatic shutdown under normal and fault conditions; and remote monitoring and support capability. It is expandable to a supervisory (SCADA) system.

Farrel Pomini’s parent company, HF Mixing Group, will show its new Advise 4.0 Mixing Room Automation solution at K 2019. Advise 4.0 is a modular and scalable system that covers every process within a mixing room—from raw-materials storage to manual and fully automated weighing of small components, the mixing process, downstream equipment, and storage of mixtures. Separate applications for particular areas and machines can be selected according to requirements and merged together into a single automation system. Standard interfaces enable easy connection to ERP systems and laboratory equipment.",United States,2019.09
532,Five Questions: Tyler Bandemer takes out Loveland’s trash,"When Loveland residents push their trash and recycling carts to the curb this week, they’ll be leaving their sold waste, figuratively, in the hands of Tyler Bandemer, the man who has been in charge of the city’s Solid Waste Division for the past eight years. Bandemer is responsible for seeing that the city’s waste is disposed of properly and efficiently. With Bandemer in charge of the operation, the city has led the state in residential recycling rates. Today, he talks about his job, which keeps Loveland looking and smelling beautiful.

And, readers, remember: Trash pickup is delayed a day this week.

Why did you get into the solid waste work?

I have always had an interest in landfills and the overall processing of garbage and waste materials. Simply put, my curiosity ultimately led me to a career in solid waste.

Do you still find yourself out on a garbage truck, running routes?

Although I have personally never been a route driver, I did have a part-time job in college riding on the back of a trash truck for the University of Wyoming. That was my first experience in the solid waste field. I do help out in the field occasionally running our downtown glass collection route from the bars and restaurants and helping with deliveries of carts to our customers.

How much trash do your crews pick up in a week, and how does that compare to similarly-sized cities?

On average, we will collect approximately 430 tons of trash (material going to the landfill); 144 tons of recyclables; and 509 tons of green-waste materials a week. If you combine the weight of all three waste streams, our numbers are likely very similar to any other city. However, when you break the numbers down by waste stream, our trash tonnages are likely lower than most cities because of our diversion programs. Many cities do not have a green-waste diversion program and that material ultimately ends up in the landfill.

What’s the most unusual item you’ve seen in a load of trash, and where do you draw the line on what you won’t pick up?

It’s not so much the odd or unusual things we see (even though there are plenty), it’s more so that people tend to throw out perfectly good stuff along with throwing a number of recyclables away (cardboard, aluminum, plastic and paper) when their recycling container is sitting right next to their trash container. We draw the line with collection of anything considered a hazardous material or e-waste, as these cannot go into the landfill.

Loveland is known for its high recycling rate. Why do you think residents here are so good at that?

Our program was designed with both the environment and the customer in mind. If we make it easy for the customer, providing a simple and accessible outlet to recycle, our customers are more likely to participate, helping us get the “good stuff” out of the trash and putting it back into the circular economy, saving landfill space. This ultimately can help us to avoid mining and harvesting virgin materials like bauxite for aluminum, oil for making plastics, and trees for paper and cardboard, just to name a few. Our single-stream curbside recycling program provides our customers an easy way to place their household recyclables together in one collection bin at the curb. For items that cannot go into the curbside recycling bin, the Recycling Center at 400 N. Wilson provides an outlet for customers to get rid of their green-waste and recyclables (accepting over 20 items). In addition, our curbside green-waste collection system provides our customers an easy means of getting rid of their grass and leaves, at the curb, if they do not want to deliver them to the Recycling Center. Although our residents continue to do an excellent job of recycling, we do ask that folks “recycle right” and do not ever bag their recyclable materials and only place approved items in their recycling containers. Contamination has become a major problem with recycling programs nationally, causing increases in processing costs.",United States,2019.09
533,Addressing water scarcity,"The threat of water scarcity may not be a top concern for those who have readily available freshwater to meet their daily needs. But for about two billion people who currently live in areas experiencing high water stress and the approximately four billion who suffer from water scarcity at least one month a year, it is a stark reality. These are the numbers approximated by UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization; en.unesco.org) in its report, “The United Nations World Water Development Report 2019: Leaving No One Behind.” While the Earth’s surface is approximately 70% water, only about 2.5% of that is freshwater, and less than half of that is readily accessible freshwater. UNESCO says that global water use has been increasing by about 1% per year since the 1980s and is expected to increase at a similar rate until 2050. This means an increase of 20–30% more water being used compared to today. Industrial and domestic water use are the main drivers for the expected rise in demand. While agriculture draws the largest water demand at about 69% of worldwide annual water use, industrial use accounts for 19% and domestic use about 12%.

A recent report by Raconteur (www.raconteur.net) in association with the World Economic Forum and British Water, called “Future of Water,” highlights water supply challenges. In the report, Alexander Lane, DuPont Water Solutions’ commercial director said, “Eighty percent of the water that is produced is released back to the environment. That’s already a source of reasonably well treated water that should be tapped, rather than just letting it go down the drain. We need to shift our thinking from linear to circular: reduce usage firstly, yes, but also then look at ways we can recycle and treat the water we have.” Thinking in terms of a circular economy is indeed a growing focus of many companies in the chemical process industries (CPI), and water stewardship is an important part of this effort.

Much work is underway to improve technologies for more efficient water use, better water and wastewater treatment, and understanding and measuring the chemistry of water treatment. See, for example “A Solvent-Extraction Approach for Desalination of High-Salinity Brines” in the September issue of Chemical Engineering (p. 6), “A New Membrane for Forward Osmosis” (CE, April 2019, p. 7), “Industrial-Grade Salt Recovery from Zero-Liquid Discharge Process” (CE, February 2019, p. 7), an article that addresses how breweries are looking at water management (CE, November 2018 pp. 14–17) and our current cover story on water chemistry (CE, October 2019, pp. 24–29).

And this month, an annual event that brings much needed focus to water-related technologies and issues is taking place in Chicago. Our preview of Weftec (www.weftec.org) on p. 27 gives more details. ■

Christopher Ross, VP of sales for Charles Ross & Son Company, passed away on July 31. Chris worked in his family business for almost 30 years and was a long-term reader and supporter of Chemical Engineering. One of his company’s most recent contributions to the pages of Chemical Engineering was the article “Beyond Simple Mixing,” which appeared in our August issue. We extend our sincere condolences to his family, friends and colleagues.",United States,2019.09
