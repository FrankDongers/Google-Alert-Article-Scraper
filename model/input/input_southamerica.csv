43,Start-ups redefining sustainability on the shortlist for circular award,"The Green Alley Award, presented by Landbell Group, is awarded to start-ups whose business ideas help advance the circular economy with new and original concepts. Created in 2014, the annual award ceremony has just released a shortlist for enterprise nominations.

Based in Mainz, Germany, the Landbell Group set up the first award in 2014 to highlight innovative start-ups working in the fields of digital circular economy, recycling schemes or waste prevention. Compliance scheme provider European Recycling Platform (ERP) UK, a Landbell Group subsidiary company, is sponsoring the event this year.

Narrowed down from 215 applicants in 30 European countries to just six, the finalists for 2018 offer a wide range of ideas for developing new sustainable materials, preventing waste or utilising digital devices to help create a circular economy.

“Each of our finalists has developed a clever, unique concept based on the idea of the circular economy,” said Jan Patrick Schulz, CEO of Landbell Group. “We are very pleased that the award has been so well received and that start-ups are strong and important drivers in such an innovation-driven sector as the circular economy.”

German company Superseven uses the Repaq brand to develop completely biodegradable packaging that can compete with plastic packaging. It has created foil packaging made of cellulose which is compostable and TUV-certified. The packaging also contains no pollutants, is suitable for food packaging and will not harm the environment, humans or animals.

A start-up from Austria, Refurbed revives used electrical and electronic equipment such as smartphones, tablets, monitors and even household appliances. Experts make the equipment new and improved, recycling the appliances whole instead of in parts, which costs consumers up to 40 per cent less.

Aiming for a world without wrappers, Minimum Waste (MIWA), from the Czech Republic, is a start-up with newly developed technology that enables food retailers and consumers to buy and sell produce without the packaging. Traders receive products from producers in containers from which consumers will then take the exact amount needed. The containers, once emptied, can be cleaned and returned to the producer to be used again.

This Italian company uses their solution ‘EcoAllene’ to overcome the difficulty of separating material mixes, such as waste products like sweet wrappers, which consist of a metal and a plastic layer. This patented production process creates a versatile new ecological plastic material which can be used in clothing, paving stones or household items.

‘Circular IQ’ is an application which collects and aggregates data across the entire supply chain, from materials sources to supplier contracts. Companies can monitor the sustainability of their products and create transparency for customers and buyers. This solution from the Netherlands attempts to provide the answers to sustainable purchasing questions for a wide range of producers.

This UK-based start-up is ‘re-thinking waste feathers’ and has developed an environmentally friendly and sustainable product to be used as insulation for packaging. The product, pluumo, uses excess feathers from the down industry that would otherwise be disposed of; these are stuffed inside certified biodegradable protective covers, also made from recycled materials.

Finalists will work on their business models in private talks with specialists from Landbell Group. After providing a live pitch in front of the jury, the winner will be announced at the award ceremony on 18 October in Berlin, and the winning start-up will receive a prize of €25,000 (around £22,360).

Sulapac, a Finnish start-up, took home the top prize in last year’s Green Alley Awards for its new alternative packaging for cosmetics products, which is both biodegradable and water and oil resistant. Its innovative design tackled the growing problem of marine plastic, which gave the enterprise its winning edge.

The jury is made up of representatives from Landbell Group and external experts including as the founder of the EU R2Pi project on Circular Economy Business Models, Alexis Figeac, and Suvi Haimi, the CEO of Sulapac.

74,Nearly 300 companies agree to eradicate plastic waste at its source,"A global commitment to eradicate plastic waste and pollution at the source has been signed by over 290 organisations. Led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF), it was announced at the Our Ocean Conference in Bali (29-30 October).

Produced in collaboration with the UN Environment, the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment has drawn signatories from many of the world’s largest packaging producers, brands, retailers and recyclers, governments and NGOs. Together, they represent 20 per cent of all plastic packaging produced globally.

Dame Ellen MacArthur said: “We know that cleaning up plastics from our beaches and oceans is vital, but this does not stop the tide of plastic entering the oceans each year. We need to move upstream to the source of the flow. The New Plastics Economy Global Commitment draws a line in the sand, with businesses, governments and others around the world uniting behind a clear vision for what we need to create a circular economy for plastic.”

The commitment has three main targets:
• To eliminate problematic or unnecessary plastic packaging and move from single-use to reuse packaging models;
• To innovate to ensure 100 per cent of plastic packaging can be easily and safely reused, recycled or composted by 2025; and
• To circulate the plastic produced by significantly increasing the amounts of plastics reused or recycled and made into new packaging or products.

The companies who have signed up include international giants such as Coca-Cola, Danone, H & M, Unilever, Mars and L’Oreal, to name just a few. The commitment hopes to create ‘a new normal’ for plastic packaging, with targets to be reviewed every 18 months and becoming increasingly ambitious. Businesses that have signed up will publish annual data on their progress to ensure transparency with the public and drive momentum.

With such a large commercial backing, EMF’s Global Commitment has the potential to change the statistic revealed in January’s Global Circularity Report: that only nine per cent of the world’s economy is circular.

EMF has been working on implementing a circular economy since its launch in 2010. In 2015, the foundation released its ‘delivering the Circular Economy’ toolkit, designed for policymakers wishing to make a transition from the linear to the circular economy.

Following the toolkit, EMF released its 2016 report, ‘The New Plastics Economy: Rethinking the future of plastics’, produced in partnership with the World Economic Forum (WEF). Here, EMF envisioned a new approach to plastic. This was based on creating ‘effective after-use pathways for plastic, drastically reducing leakage of plastics into natural systems...and decoupling plastics from fossil feedstocks.’

The report found that 95 per cent of the value of plastic packaging material is lost to the economy each year. This initiative from EMF stimulated 11 producers and retailers (such as Evian, Unilever and Coca-Cola) to announce or reaffirm pledges for circular economy plastic packaging.

EMF also held a Circular Materials Challenge, rewarding five innovative alternatives to plastic packaging with a $1-million circular economy prize at the World Economic Forum in January 2018.

105,Veolia and Unilever team up to tackle plastic waste,"A new cross-sector partnership will see three years of investment into new technologies to increase the recycling of plastics.

Waste management company Veolia and consumer goods company Unilever have signed a collaboration agreement on sustainable packaging, creating a partnership to build a circular economy for plastic across the globe.

Committing to working together, the companies say, is an acknowledgment that the issue of plastic waste is a ‘shared responsibility’ requiring ‘bold action across the value chain’.

As Marc Engel, Unilever’s Chief Supply Chain Officer, explained: “The scale of the plastic waste issue is getting worse, not better, with the production of plastics expected to double over the next two decades. We all have a lot more to do to address this critical issue and we hope that by partnering with Veolia, a world leader in waste management, we can take meaningful strides towards a circular economy.”

Beginning with a focus on India and Indonesia, the partnership will be developing and scaling up waste collection and recycling infrastructure, helping to direct recycled material back into the value chain. This will involve the companies working together to implement used packaging collection solutions, expand recycling capacity and develop new processes and business models.

Unilever is the world’s largest consumer goods company, boasting a huge number of well-known food, home care and personal care brands in its portfolio, including Dove, Persil, Magnum and PG Tips. The company has been taking steps to reduce its environmental impact, committing last year to making 100 per cent of its packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025.

Unilever is also a founding member of the UK Plastics Pact, helping to develop the wider 2025 targets that the Pact signatories are working towards: to eliminate unnecessary single-use plastic, to ensure that 70 per cent of packaging is recycled or reprocessed, and to have 30 per cent recycled content in all packaging within the next seven years.

Meanwhile, Veolia has produced a study in partnership with plastic recycling company RECOUP, which reveals that consumers could be willing to pay extra to see more recycled content in their products. However, the report acknowledges that recycling and recovery infrastructure needs to be vastly improved in order for recycled plastics to be made more affordable and widely available in the UK.

While Veolia previously said it will be investing £1 billion in the UK’s domestic infrastructure, its investments overseas through the new partnership with Unilever show an acknowledgment that inadequate waste management in developing countries contributes hugely to the amount of plastic that ends up in our natural environment.

In 2017, a widely quoted report revealed that up to 92 per cent of all plastic in the oceans comes from 10 rivers in Africa and Asia. However, the UK, Europe, North America and other large economies cannot escape their contribution to this plastic pollution as they continue to export their plastic waste overseas, often to countries that cannot properly deal with that waste – showing that plastic pollution is an international problem, requiring international solutions.

Laurent Auguste, Senior Executive Vice-President of Veolia for Development, Innovation and Markets, commented: “There is an undeniable need to transform the current way plastic packaging [at] end-of-life is managed in order to reduce significantly its environmental footprint. It will take a collaboration of a new kind between all the actors of the value chain.

“With this global partnership, Veolia and Unilever join forces in various geographies around the globe and, from the collection to the recycling, take a leadership role to redefine a responsible and sustainable future for packaging”.",Colombia,2018.10
113,Accelerator programme launched for London’s circular economy entrepreneurs,"An accelerator programme to support new companies in the circular economy field is now open for applications from innovative entrepreneurs.

The accelerator, the first of its kind in London, is run by the London Waste and Recycling Board (LWARB) through its Advance London programme, and is focused on finding and commercialising the strongest new circular economy start-ups in the built environment sector.

Each start-up must already have a working prototype and be ready to test their technologies in the market. In return, the accelerator will offer six months of free intensive support for up to 10 start-ups, as well as desk space provided in LWARB’s new offices, bespoke mentoring and access to an extensive partner network.

The UK is slowly emerging as a hotspot for green start-ups, as the home country for the winners of the Green Alley Award in both 2015 (Adaptavate) and 2018 (Aeropowder). With this new accelerator, Advance London hopes to enable the rapid scaling up of innovative projects, and will be working in partnership with The Carbon Trust and consultants Whole Earth Futures to deliver the programme.

The first cohort of start-ups will have ambitions to revolutionise the construction industry specifically. LWARB hopes to find entrepreneurs who will:
• Develop new technologies and business models that can advance modularisation;

Start-up businesses will also be selected on their potential for expansion and ability to contribute towards London’s low carbon, circular economy.

Wayne Hubbard, Chief Executive at LWARB, announced the accelerator launch at a meeting of the new global initiative, PG4 (Partnering for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030), which aims to stimulate the development of public-private partnerships to help achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

Hubbard said: “If cities are the engine rooms of the circular economy, start-ups are the spark. Start-up businesses are making an essential contribution to London’s transition to become a circular city, and this accelerator is part of LWARB’s strategy to provide support and finance to circular economy businesses from start-up to maturity.”

He addedd that time is a crucial factor: “The recent IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report has shown us the need for urgent action; this support programme forms a part of our response.”

The IPCC report, released on 8 October, revealed that unless there is an immediate response to stop global warming, and the earth’s global temperature rises by more than 1.5°C, climate change could cause irreversible damage to our planet.

The Mayor of London’s Environment Strategy and Economic Development Strategy both set out ways to implement a low carbon economy and develop start-up ecosystems. LWARB’s accelerator will help new entrepreneurs overcome some of the barriers to establishing products and services within their market.

Deputy Mayor for Environment and Energy, Shirley Rodrigues, also commented: “The Mayor is working hard to make London a world leader in efforts to promote a circular economy, which could provide London with net benefits of at least £7 billion every year and 40,000 new jobs by 2036.

“The IPCC is clear: action on climate change cannot wait and circular economy businesses of all sizes and sectors have a vital role to play. This accelerator is a great opportunity to nurture London’s start-up businesses and help our low carbon economy flourish.”

Entrepreneurs are encouraged to apply to LWARB’s accelerator programme through the Advance London website.",Colombia,2018.10
136,UK start-up wins top prize at European circular economy awards,"UK start-up Aeropowder won the 2018 Green Alley Award last week for its sustainable insulation material made from waste chicken feathers.

Global environmental consultancy company Landbell Group set up the Green Alley Awards in 2014, aiming to transform the waste and recycling industry by supporting innovative green start-ups. At the award ceremony in Berlin on 18 October, six European finalists presented a live pitch to the audience and a jury of experts, made up of representatives from award organisers Landbell Group and its partners in the circular economy.

After the expert panel consulted with one another, Aeropowder was announced as the winning start-up for its alternative approach to a frequently forgotten waste product.

Aeropowder uses waste feathers from the poultry industry, which are thoroughly cleaned and treated before being covered in a certified, compostable food grade liner. These components make up a material Aeropowder has called pluumo, which the company hopes can become a sustainable replacement to conventional polystyrene packaging, PE-foams or thermal foil.

Already popular in the UK, Aeropowder has had its whole stock bought by one butcher, who admired the sustainable packaging for the upmarket and environmentally-friendly edge it provided to his products over those of his competitors.

The start-up will receive a prize of €25,000 (around £22,360), which it promises will go towards a new machine to help the two-person company try to meet the high demand for its product. Aside from the cash prize and an upcycled trophy made of elements from roller shutters, Aeropowder will also have the advice of the Landbell Group on hand as it continues to expand.

Elena Dieckmann, co-founder of Aeropowder, said: “Winning the Green Alley Award shows us that we are going in the right direction. Feathers have incredible properties, as they are lightweight and robust, and insulate against heat and cold. We have requests from Spain, Germany and France; not only from customers but also from feather suppliers.”

Aeropowder was one of six finalists announced in September, whittled down from the 215 entrepreneurs in over 30 countries who applied this year.

“Once again, this year’s decision was not easy, and our finalists presented six strong and well-designed concepts,” said Jan Patrick Schulz, CEO of Landbell Group. “Aeropowder convinced us with their product pluumo, as they are repurposing materials which would otherwise be disposed of. We want to give the Green Alley Award to those innovative approaches that directly feed into the idea of a circular economy.”

This year there was also a crowd award from Seedmatch, Germany’s first platform for crowd investing. This was awarded to the German start-up, Superseven, which has designed a 100 per cent biodegradable type of packaging made from cellulose. This prize includes a one-day workshop with the Seedmatch team, teaching the start-up how to create their own crowd campaign, whilst also offering a crowdfunding campaign on Seedmatch or Econeer (its sister platform).

The growing success of the Green Alley Awards means it has attracted more partners over time; aside from Seedmatch, Landbell Group now works with Bethnal Green Ventures (a UK accelerator programme) and R2Pi (an EU Horizon 2020 project). This year, the event was also sponsored by the compliance scheme provider European Recycling Platform (ERP) UK, a Landbell Group subsidiary company.

2018 finalists The founders of the six start-ups

Aside from Aeropowder and Superseven, there were four other innovative start-ups hoping to change the way waste is handled.

Circular IQ, based in Amsterdam, has designed new software that would enable customers and buyers across the supply chain to monitor and optimize the circularity of their products.

Austrian start-up Refurbed is also looking at how digitalisation can be used to support a circular economy. It offers an online marketplace where high-quality refurbished products from smartphones to computer monitors can be sold on, as brand new, reducing the amount of new products that need to be manufactured.

Meanwhile, Italian company Ecoplasteam took a more hands-on approach, instead dealing with physical waste at the end of its life cycle. Ecoplasteam has created a new recycling technique capable of processing all the different components of aluminium packages together, which produces a new plastic and metal composite material.

MIWA, from the Czech Republic, introducing some unique technology to the concept of buying food in reusable containers. The company’s innovation would see food stored in capsules in supermarkets, ordered through an app by the customer and then packed in a reusable container for the customer to take home, bypassing the concept of single-use packaging altogether.

What is the future of the circular economy?

Resource spoke to Dr Thomas Fischer, Head of Market Intelligence and Governmental Affairs for the Landbell Group, to discuss how our attitude towards waste is beginning to change – and how start-ups can help.

He began by saying that “driven by public opinion and marine littering”, the circular economy concept has a great chance of taking off and replacing our current linear economic model.

But removing plastic packaging altogether isn’t the answer; as Fischer went on to point out, packaging is an integral part of life today. “You need it for food, to prolong shelf-life. So we will need more complex packaging – we need to strike a balance between preserving the function of something, like food, and preventing waste. Prevention must come first, and then we can create the right solutions for packaging.

“We need to design solutions for materials which are currently non-recyclable,” he continued, adding that this presents a large market available for more green start-ups to move into.

Through the Green Alley Award, start-ups are given a platform for recognition. “We raise awareness for them because of the publicity that surrounds the award and the finalists, [and] we also offer networking and expert sessions,” Fischer explained, pointing out that Landbell has built a clientbase for last year’s winner, Sulapac, a Finnish start-up creating sustainable packaging for cosmetics.

299,Scottish Resources Awards 2018 winners announced,"A young anti-waste campaigner focusing on the collection of compostable packaging was among the winners at this year’s Scottish Resources Awards.

The awards brought the curtain down on this year’s Scottish Resources Conference, which ran from Wednesday to Thursday (3-4 October), delivered by Zero Waste Scotland (ZWS) and conference partners CIWM and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).

Five award were up for grabs, recognising excellence and achievement in the Scottish resources and circular economy sectors before a gathering of representatives from businesses and organisations across the country.

Kate Chambers won the Young People Award, which was presented in partnership with The Vibes Scottish Environment Business Awards to mark Scotland’s Year of Young People.

Resource Futures consultant Chambers has previously spent two years with Vegware, an Edinburgh-based packaging company that produces compostable food and drink packaging, while also working on Close the Loop, a circular economy initiative that works to guarantee compostable packaging is collected with food waste and processed through industrial composting facilities.

Other winners included a wind turbine refurbishment centre, an algae-based energy production project and a school-based electrical goods recycling project.

The full list of 2018 winners are as follows:
• Best Partnership Initiative Award: ‘Love Your Gadgets’ – a consortium of Falkirk Council, LAMH Recycle, Re-tek, Valpak and XS Resources

Iain Gulland, Chief Executive of ZWS, picked up the Outstanding Contribution Award for his work furthering the circular economy in Scotland. “I’m thrilled and honoured to be recognised by so many of my peers at such an important industry platform as this,” he commented. “It means a lot to me, but this is an award for more than me as an individual – it’s an award for all my colleagues at Zero Waste Scotland, the many partners we work with and others who support us, notably in Scottish Government, without whom our vision to progress a Circular Economy in Scotland would not be possible.

“It’s great to see young people engaging with the fight against waste and making a real difference. Young people have the biggest stake in tackling climate change and all the young entrants should be lauded for their efforts to make Scotland more sustainable. Kate is a fantastic example of the work that’s being done across this country to find practical solutions to serious problems and to create opportunities in the circular economy. I hope that she – and all those who have picked up awards – will be an inspiration to others to do the same.”

Dr Nicki Souter, chair of the CIWM Scotland Centre, said: ""CIWM's mission is to support excellence and professionalism across the resources and waste sector. We are delighted to see that this year's award winners are making a real difference in important areas including food waste, reuse, and other circular economy initiatives and demonstrate a strong commitment to skills, innovation and partnership working.""

311,Scottish brewery turns unwanted bread into craft beer,"A Scottish brewery is putting circular economy principles into practice with a new craft ale made out of loaves of unsold bread.

Based on the Isle of Bute on the western coast of Scotland, Bute Brew Co’s 5.1 per cent ‘Thorough Bread’ beer is made from unsold loaves of bread from the local Co-operative store, with the bread replacing some of the malt that would normally be used in the brewing process.

The research and development that went into the brewing process was backed by the Scottish Government and EU funding, with Zero Waste Scotland (ZWS) providing the seed funding for the consultancy work that underpinned it.

Thorough Bread has already received praise from industry, having been shortlisted in the Innovation of the Year category of the Scottish Beer Awards and Best Eco Friendly category at the Scotsman Food and Drink Awards, both of which took place in September.

Bute Brew Co are not the only ones to have applied circular principles to the art of beer-making, with food waste campaigner Tristram Stuart launching his ‘Toast Ale’ back in 2016, which is made using discarded crusts and unsold loaves of bread.

Iain Gulland, Chief Executive of ZWS, described Bute Brew Co as “a perfect example of the way circular economy principles are being put into practice in Scotland”. He continued: “By turning leftovers into an opportunity, they have created a fantastic business opportunity while tackling waste at the same time. I hope their success will be an inspiration for other businesses to come up with their own circular economy business ideas.”



Aidan Canavan, owner of Bute Brew, added: “Our customers absolutely love this beer, and they love it when they find out how it is made too. ZWS were really supportive of our idea and the initial funding they provided helped make this possible. Thorough Bread has proven really popular and I’m proud that it’s a real community effort, with the bread coming from local stores.”

Thorough Bread is the latest circular initiative to come out of Scotland, which has placed itself at the forefront of circular economy thinking in the UK. Delegates have been gathered in Edinburgh for the Scottish Resources Conference, delivered by ZWS and partners CIWM and SEPA (the Scottish Environment Protection Agency) to discuss the future of Scotland’s circular economy and resources sector, with key speakers including Ian Schofield, Own Label and Packaging Manager at Iceland Foods, and Roseanna Cunningham MSP, Cabinet Secretary for the Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform.

Meanwhile, from 30 October to 1 November, Scotland will play host to the Circular Economy Hotspot, a major international event to showcase the nation's progressive approach to developing a circular economy and the best of its burgeoning circular businesses to a global audience.

ZWS has been a key driver behind Scotland’s push towards a circular economy, leading on delivery of the £73-million Resource Efficient Circular Economy Accelerator Programme, which aims to improve the economic performance of SMEs while simultaneously reducing the impact of economic activity on the natural environment. The organisation states that, across Europe, moving towards a more circular economy could generate £1.4 trillion of annual benefits by 2030.

In May this year, ZWS and the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce launched an initiative to help small and medium-sized enterprises identify and maximise circular economy opportunities. A range of activities are being held to help identify opportunities for local businesses and direct them towards available support and funding.",Colombia,2018.10
346,‘The line between used and new is blurring’: Fashion brands are buying in to pre-worn goods –,"In a shift from even a few years ago, fashion brands have begun actively seeking ways to participate in the “circular economy,” a term that reflects the trading, re-selling and borrowing of apparel and accessories that have previously been worn by someone else.

While neither the clothes nor the platforms are entirely new, the active participation from brands certainly is. But it’s not only because the sustainability conversation has become fashionable. Secondhand has largely lost its stigma, and brands are seeing business incentives to tap into the estimated $20 billion resale pie — a figure that doesn’t even include the rental market.

The latest such launch is cool eco-chic brand Reformation, which on Tuesday begins a partnership with resale site ThredUp that will give ThredUp resellers the option to be paid in a Reformation gift card — with an added incentive (through December, at least) of a payout that is 15 percent more than what ThredUp would normally pay. Normally, sellers to ThredUp can choose between PayPal cash or ThredUp credits.

ThredUp declined to share an average payout amount, saying it could range from $5 to $1,000, depending on what types of items the seller sends. Payouts are based on what an item can sell for; for example, if ThredUp is able to charge $50 for a piece, it will pay the seller 40 percent of that value ($20), or if it is a luxe item, the seller will get 50 percent, or $25. (The payout percentage increases with the value of the items.)

The program offers value for both Reformation and ThredUp: Reformation gains potential new customers and additional sales by attracting shoppers with a gift card, and ThredUp is able to drive more secondhand supply. (ThredUp pays out the value they normally would for the gift card, while Reformation covers the additional 15 percent.)

“Retailers are realizing that through this program, they can launch a loyalty program that is good for the planet and good for business,” said ThredUp vp of marketing communications and partnerships Karen Clark. “Sometimes they don’t need to be mutually exclusive — customers are incentivized to resell.”

The program, called UpCycle, will eventually be extended to other brand partnerships, but Reformation — which started with repurposed secondhand clothes, and still has a sustainability ethos — was a natural fit to test the format. “We started Reformation to create a sustainable way to be fashionable, and because we believe consumers have the buying and selling power to eliminate waste,” said Reformation founder and CEO Yael Aflalo, who added that UpCycle adds ways to shop responsibly.

Clark said that in the past year, ThredUp has seen a “surge of interest” from brands wanting to take an active role in fashion resale.

“Brands are saying, ‘We get that resale is accelerating, and customers are telling us they want ways to dive into this circular economy and have more affordable options — so how can we get involved?,’” Clark said. “A lot of the companies we have talked to that have tried to power their own program have a lot of trouble, because they don’t have the operational infrastructure to price and list hundreds of thousands of products a day.”

In 2019, Clark said, ThredUp will begin powering secondhand shopping experiences, meaning that brands will be able to offer their own clothing recycling programs using ThredUp’s technology and infrastructure, and will be able to offer used clothing next to new items.

“The line between used and new is blurring, and the closet of the future has a lot of used clothes in it,” Clark said, adding that a re-sell program keeps the inventory fresh without being fast fashion or compromising on quality. “Consumers are looking for retailers that are able to replenish inventory frequently and we have an endless supply chain. You don’t have to produce it and wait six months, because we are getting new clothes every day.” This model could be online — a brand sells previously worn pieces on the same site it sells new items — or through a physical store-in-store, with a section that is “powered by ThredUp,” for example, Clark said.

Brands such as Patagonia, The North Face and Eileen Fisher offer various versions of trade and reuse programs, but high-fashion brands might be next to catch on.

In September, Burberry announced it would stop destroying unsold inventory and would increasingly focus and expand on existing efforts to “reuse, repair, donate or recycle unsaleable products,” including a partnership with the Make Fashion Circular Initiative and a partnership with sustainable luxury brand Elvis & Kresse to turn leather “offcuts” into new products. At the time, Burberry CEO Marco Gobbetti said “modern luxury means being socially and environmentally responsible.”

This has been part of the Stella McCartney brand’s identity since its founding in 2001. It became the first brand to partner with luxury re-commerce site The RealReal to reward customers for consigning pieces: If a seller consigns a Stella McCartney item on The RealReal, she gets a $100 Stella McCartney gift card, and can only qualify for this perk once a year. Director of marketing Allison Sommer said there have been an equal number of these being rewarded month over month in the year since the program has existed, indicating increased awareness and adoption.

Since then, other brands have come calling.

“Sustainability is a fashionable topic,” said Sommer. “There’s a shift in the frequency in conversations around sustainability, plus from a business perspective, the number of outreaches from brands looking to partner with us or understand our ethos has definitely increased and shifted in tone. When I joined a few years ago, there was a lot of uncertainty into how we fit into luxury fashion, and all of a sudden, we are getting inbound requests from designers wanting to learn more about how our partnership with Stella is doing and how it is structured.”

On Monday, The RealReal introduced a “sustainability calculator,” which is a tool that works to quantify approximately how much greenhouse gas, energy and water is saved from each piece of women’s clothing that is consigned. Sellers have access to a personal dashboard that estimates how many car miles they’ve offset, how many seedlings they’ve planted and how much water has been saved, using attributes such as weight, fabric and type of garment.

Sommer predicted a “giant shift” in the next five years in how brands will approach circular fashion. “It’s just a matter of time before everyone has to and wants to have sustainability as a tenet of their brands and products,” Sommer said. “At this point, we don’t need to spend time convincing everyone — the customers are doing that themselves as luxury brands are struggling to keep the top funnel of customers.”

Rent the Runway execs have witnessed a striking about-face, as brands are eager to be available on the clothing and accessories rental marketplace.

Among the 50 new brands to Rent the Runway this fall are Marc Jacobs, Victoria Beckham, Iro, Golden Goose, Reformation and Philip Lim, totaling 500 brands available to borrow.

In a walk-through of Rent the Runway’s new San Francisco space in September, chief operating officer Maureen Sullivan said fashion brands now see the company as a marketing tool to help brands “unlock” new customers; about 98 percent of Rent the Runway customers have never worn the brand before when they rent a piece, she said.

This is a stark contrast to when the company started in 2009, when co-founder and ceo Jennifer Hymen struggled to convince brands that luxury rentals wouldn’t cannibalize a business. “When I joined three years ago, Jenn joked that it was the golden years. Now brands love us a partner,” Sullivan said.",Colombia,2018.10
358,Bryson Recycling celebrates 25 years cleaning up Northern Ireland’s waste,"Northern Irish social enterprise Bryson Recycling celebrated its 25th anniversary last week (26 September) and has pledged to stay at the forefront of delivering innovative recycling services to Northern Ireland.

Since its inception in 1993, Bryson Recycling has recycled over 675,000 tonnes of material – it recycled 212 million plastic items in the last year alone – and has grown beyond Northern Ireland to deliver its ‘Bryson Model’ to Donegal, Ireland, and Conwy, Wales.

It is now the largest social enterprise recycler in the UK, employing more than 280 staff and recently being awarded UK Social Enterprise of the Year, coming a long way since its first Cash for Cans scheme, which was operated by three government-funded trainees.

Bryson has been on the front line of innovation in recycling services, introducing the Kerb-Sort vehicle and the Wheelie Box to the marketplace, while also maintaining a local circular economy approach that sees over 80 per cent of the materials it collects in Northern Ireland sent to local reprocessing companies, supporting 1,000 jobs locally.

Northern Irish businesses Huhtamaki, Cherry Pipes and Encirc all reprocess materials collected by Bryson. This collaborative approach with reprocessors and a number of councils adds over £100m every year to the Northern Ireland economy and Bryson has ambitions to increase this by a further 50 per cent in coming years.

In 2003, Bryson’s commercial collection service was launched and now collects recyclables from over 500 businesses and schools, while it also operates a materials recovery facility that sorts materials collected from around 300,000 households in the arc21 group of councils in Northern Ireland.

Bryson’s recycling ambitions also have a charitable element, with its annual Recycling Rewards Campaign, which encourages more than 170,000 households over the course of a year to recycle as much as they can, with every tonne of glass, paper and plastic collected through Bryson’s kerbside boxes seeing £1 donated to a charity. This year’s charity is MACS NI, which supports children and young people who have experienced difficulties across Northern Ireland with services including supported housing, floating support and wellbeing support, focusing on housing, homelessness and mental health.

Speaking at the company’s 25th anniversary event, Eric Randall, Director at Bryson Recycling, said: “Homeowners are more aware of the damage that plastic products are causing to the environment. This year we have experienced a huge increase in the number of plastic items across our recycling services; we are now processing an extra 200,000 plastic items each day at our Mallusk site. This increased awareness about plastics, largely due to the shocking images showing the impact of plastics in our seas in David Attenborough’s Blue Planet, has encouraged people to recycle more and offered us the opportunity to boost recycling rates.

“The simple reality is that waste impacts everyone and the environment. Our model ensures good environmental outcomes by ensuring that goods are recycled locally, livelihoods are supported and the economy continues to grow.

“The future of recycling must focus on the quality of material collected and their local economic value. The impact of our model stretches beyond Northern Ireland. With many areas across the UK adopting it. We are confident recycling will be taken taken to the next level and Bryson will continue to champion and shape the local circular economy model.”

458,Innovative furniture reuse enterprise in Scotland making waves in circular economy,"A new furniture reuse enterprise has drawn praise from Scottish First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, for bringing the benefits of reuse and repair to housing associations and social landlords in Glasgow.

Total Homes Co-operative launched a service called Void Clearance last month, which collects household furniture which would otherwise go to landfill, before recovering and repairing the items. The furniture can then be sold on once more for an affordable price to the public, contributing to the circular economy with minimal waste.

Praised by the First Minister at the recent Circular Economy Hotspot event in Glasgow for the benefits it brings to housing associations and social landlords by saving costs and reducing waste, the co-operative is also supported by the environmental consultancy Resource Futures. This consultancy helps small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) such as Total Homes grow financially stable circular business models.

Resource Futures’ support was facilitated through two of Zero Waste Scotland’s (ZWS) schemes: the Circular Economy Business Support Service, which produces tailored support programmes for SMEs, and the Circular Economy Investment Fund, which offers financial backing that will help deliver circular economy growth.

Pauline Smith from ReConnect Glasgow, a founder of Total Homes, said: “We could see that house clearances often ended up producing a substantial amount of waste, and that there was a big opportunity for someone to help close the loop. Total Homes is all about reusing and repairing as many items as possible, enabling landlords to reduce their environmental impact and allowing prospective tenants to obtain good quality items at lower cost.

“Our cooperative model allows new members to join as we grow, and for any profits to be reinvested into the scheme for the benefit of the communities we work within.”

The Circular Economy in Scotland is worth approximately £1 billion, as ZWS revealed in a report released in October. Scotland also committed to a deposit return scheme in September 2017, whereby once drink containers are returned to the place of purchase, the consumer can receive a small deposit back. Scotland already has a well-established foundation for the reuse industry, but with collaborations such as Resource Futures and Total Homes Co-op, there is great hope that the country’s circular economy will continue to grow.

As Allan Sandilands, Principal Consultant from Resource Futures, commented: “This is a great example of how organisations in Scotland are taking reuse to new levels and making breakthroughs towards a circular economy. At the moment, Total Homes is working within Glasgow but we see the potential for this model to be scaled up and delivered across Scotland.”

Resource Futures is also involved with a range of other reuse projects outside of Total Homes. With public sector organisations such as NHS Highland and NHS Shetland, it hopes to increase reuse by developing a Waste Prevention and Reuse Action Plan. This would enable the company to understand waste prevention, and develop a clear strategy towards implementing more reuse.

Sandilands said: “It’s great to see that more organisations across the public and private sector are recognising the financial, environmental and social benefits of circular business models and resource efficiency, and we’re delighted to continue playing a role in supporting this important shift to more sustainable resource management for Scotland and beyond.”

Outside of Scotland, Resource Futures is also working in Wales, as seen in its recent report for WRAP Cymru and the Welsh Government, ‘Preparing for reuse: a roadmap for a paradigm shift in Wales’. The report revealed that preparing waste for reuse would also create jobs and save money whilst reducing waste.",Colombia,2018.11
467,Wales invests £5.4m in new reuse and recycling projects,"Wales is investing £5.4 million across eight new projects to improve levels of reuse and recycling, Environment Minister Hannah Blythyn has announced.

To coincide with the announcement, Blythyn is today (22 November) visiting The Shed Recycling Shop in Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf. The Shed, operated by social enterprise Waste Savers, is an example of a successful reuse organisation that the Welsh Government is looking to replicate across the country; in five months in 2018, the shop saved 70.96 tonnes of items from going to waste, generating around £50,000 in revenue through resale.

A portion of the new government funding will help Rhondda Cynon Taf set up a second reuse facility in Treherbert, following in the footsteps of The Shed, which employs 2-3 staff and a team of volunteers.

Back in July, a Welsh Government report turned the spotlight on reuse, underlining how sharing best practice and replicating successful local initiatives would be key to reducing waste, as well as improving local initiatives

The report, titled ‘Preparing for re-use: A roadmap for a paradigm shift’, envisions a scenario in which reuse of all products becomes a mainstream part of the economy. By following the report’s recommendations, it is suggested that up to 1,170,000 tonnes of reusable items (including furniture, textiles, paint, wood and electronics) could be saved from disposal, and Wales could make nearly £1.5 million in sales from items prepared for reuse.

This new £5.4 million of funding indicates the Welsh Government’s continued commitment to reuse and repair. The eight projects receiving capital funding are:
• £500,000 to Pembrokeshire County Council to support a Zero Waste Schools initiative, teaching primary and secondary school children in 24 schools about the importance of recycling;
• £1,020,000 to Conwy and Denbighshire County Councils to support the creation of a new ‘Green Shed’, a regional reuse, repair and recycling hub;
• £1,175,000 to Newport City Council to support initiatives by Newport Wastesavers, as well as new waste baling machinery;
• £900,000 to Denbighshire County Council to help it improve its waste collection in line with the Collections Blueprint, a preferred system for the recycling of household waste. Councils adopting the blueprint have notably reported improvements in their recycling rates;
• £541,000 to Blaenau Gwent CBC to improve recycling and composting, including through new recycling vehicles and bins;
• £120,000 to Rhondda Cynon Taf CBC for the development of a second reuse centre;
• £646,375 to Monmouthshire County Council, to commence works at Five Lanes Transfer Station to bulk separately collected materials; and
• £490,000 to Merthyr Tydfil CBC to improve collections and reuse.

All projects will be completed during 2018/19.

Despite the most recent figures showing a slight dip in the country’s recycling rate for the first time, dropping from 63.8 per cent in 2016/17 to 62.7 per cent in 2017/18, Wales remains far ahead of the other UK nations, retaining its spot as the second best recycler in Europe and third best in the world after Germany and Taiwan.

Much of this success can be put down to the fact that the Welsh Government is continually pumping money into its recycling services, with £800 million invested since 2001/02, according to Blythyn. Just last month, a £50-million commitment was announced to continue pushing the nation’s recycling rates upwards. £15.5 million of that will go to the Vale of Glamorgan, Pembrokeshire and Denbighshire, all of which reported drops in their recycling rates this year, while £500,000 has been set aside for a new behaviour change campaign to educate householders about recycling.

The added funding announced today for reuse and recycling projects brings the total funding for waste services this year alone above £80 million. Blythyn explained: “One of the best ways to reduce waste is to repair and refurbish items so they can be reused and some of these projects will improve facilities to enable this. We’re also investing in a pilot schools project to reduce waste and instil good habits from a young age.



“Where materials can’t be reused, the next best method is to recycle, so we’re also investing in the machinery to better manage recyclable items. This range of new projects will not only help reduce waste in the coming years, it should lead to a cultural change in the longer term, helping us achieve our ambition to become a ‘Zero Waste Nation’ by 2050.”

Crest Co-operative, which will be receiving funding to expand its network of community reuse workshops and stores in Conwy and Denbighshire, has welcomed the news, with Jay Martin, Strategic Business Development Manager, keen to stress the important social benefits of reuse. Martin commented: ""Aside [from] the obvious environmental benefits of our reuse activities, they also make a significant contribution to addressing the poverty agenda by enabling low income individuals and families access to good quality furniture and electrical goods for a fraction of new cost.

“We anticipate that this capital grant will enable us to create new employment opportunities [and] apprenticeships in our expanded and improved workshops and reuse retail stores during 2019.”

Circular Economy Wales CIC is working to develop blueprints for the replication of circular initiatives with social benefits. The organisation is integral to the roll-out of the 'Green Shed' initiative across Wales, one of which one was launched in Pembrokeshire earlier this year. Each Green Shed acts as an independent local hub for repair, reuse and recycling, as well as providing training and employment opportunities. Crest will be delivering the new Green Shed in Conwy.

Eifion Williams, CEO of Circular Economy Wales, commented: “We welcome the Welsh Government’s commitment to involving community organisations in the next phase of its Zero Waste Policy. These developments build on the pilot support given last year for Pembrokeshire Frame’s 'Green Shed' concept where the public and our schools can get involved in re-design and reprocessing new goods.

“Involving the education of the next few generations will be a game changer. This takes Wales into new territory where Wales will be the standard bearer globally for this kind of thinking.

“Circular Economy Wales will be carrying the Green Shed concept and Circular Economy Schools to the rest of Wales. I’m personally proud that Wales is taking the lead like this; Hannah Blythyn is to be congratulated for her vision.”",Colombia,2018.11
573,Coral’s new plant ready for January after investment boost,"Coral Products (Mouldings) Ltd’s new in-house recycling plant, based at its site in Haydock, Merseyside, will be fully operational in January 2019, following a recent investment boost.

The recycling plant will provide a new avenue for councils and local authorities to recycle polypropylene waste products. At the site, the waste plastic will be reground and used to create new products, reducing the amount of waste going to landfill. 

 

The established plastics company took its range of plastic kerbside recycling and food waste products to both RWM and LARAC 2018, where they, along with its circular economy-efficient business model and processes, drew much interest from the assembled audiences of waste professionals.

Coral has a wide range of products designed for the collection and storage of waste, ranging from a five-litre food waste caddy to a 62-litre storage box.

The company’s 23-litre deluxe kerbside caddy was also discussed during LARAC 2018. It has been tried out by a wide variety of consumers in rural, urban and coastal locations, with positive feedback on Coral’s strong product, design achievements and quality testing processes.

592,New apprenticeship for metals recycling launched,"Sir Gerry Berragan, Chief Executive of the Institute for Apprenticeships, has launched the first apprenticeship focusing specifically on the metals recycling industry.

The Metal Recycling General Operative (MRGO) is a level 2 apprenticeship for employees of any age. A 12 to 18 month assessment, it covers a range of areas within the £7 billion UK metals recycling industry and explores the problems that those working in the field face.

The metals recycling industry plays an important role in the circular economy, providing secondary raw material, preserving natural resources, saving energy and reducing CO2 emissions by up to 80 per cent in metals production. As the OECD predicts world resource use will double by 2060, retaining industry knowledge and standards by successfully training the next generation is increasingly important.

The official launch of the apprenticeship, created by the British Metals Recycling Association (BMRA), was held at scrap metal recyclers EMR in Willesden. Antonia Grey, Public Affairs and Communication Manager at BMRA, said: “The apprenticeship was developed because we recognised the need for sector-specific qualifications, not only to bring new talent into the industry but also to provide a career path for those working in the sector. The scheme will also allow experienced employees in different areas to pass on valuable knowledge, which is often lost if they leave.

“We see the apprenticeship as a first step in promoting the metals recycling sector as a STEM employer. We will look to work with organisations that promote metals recycling and STEM, with myself and fellow BMRA representatives becoming STEM ambassadors.”

The pilot programme had apprentices from a range of recycling companies such as S.Sackers, Recycled Products and Recycling Lives. Following its success, metal recycling apprentices up and down the country can now work in a company of any size, learning how to fill an operative role within a metal recycling yard. This includes understanding environmental policy, working with current legislation, and learning how to accept hazardous and non-hazardous materials.

After completing the apprenticeship, candidates will also be encouraged to join Young British Metals Recyclers, which is the BMRA’s initiative for those in the industry under the age of 35.

Susie Burrage, BMRA President added: “The government apprenticeship levy gives small and medium-sized businesses the opportunity to train employees in skills that are relevant to metals recycling. By supporting the industry from the ground up and giving young people the necessary training in key business areas, we hope that we can plug the skills gap and keep metals recycling at the forefront of the circular economy.”

The UK metal recycling industry is the leading contributor to the UK’s achievement of circular economy targets in EU Directives set out in May. It is so efficient at recovering metal from end-of-life products that more is now recovered than can be consumed domestically, which has led to around 80 per cent of all UK waste metal being exported. In 2017 alone, the UK exported 9 million tonnes of recovered iron and steel and 800,000 tonnes of other, non-ferrous metal.

The apprenticeship will hopefully ensure that the metal recycling industry contains to expand with a new generation. The scheme is expected to be rolled out to subsequent cohorts from March next year.

636,Glasgow aims to be Scotland’s ‘first circular city’,"Glasgow has announced ambitions to become Scotland’s ‘first circular city’, with plans to publish a ‘route map’ to circularity next year.

The announcement came at this year’s Circular Economy Hotspot, an international conference focused on sharing knowledge and ideas around the circular economy. Sustainable business practices across Scotland were showcased at the event, which was held at the SEC Centre in Glasgow (30 October – 1 November).

Glasgow City Council has said it is aiming both to reduce the amount of waste it produces, and to focus on reusing all waste that is generated. Its ‘Circular Economy Route Map’, to be published in 2019, will focus on five key areas: food, textiles, energy, plastics and the built environment. One specific commitment announced at the Hotspot event was for 15 per cent of the city’s homes to be powered by renewable energy by 2030.

Driving the move towards a circular economy in the city is Circular Glasgow, a project launched in 2017 in partnership with Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, Zero Waste Scotland and Circle Economy, and funded with help from the European Regional Development Fund.

Aiming to support Glasgow businesses to cut down on waste and make financial savings at the same time, Circular Glasgow initially carried out a ‘scan’ of the city to assess the potential for moving towards a circular economy.

The organisation has also set up a series of ‘challenges’, facilitated through the Circle Lab, which is an online crowdsourcing platform designed to find circular solutions to global challenges. The first challenge, launched in March this year, asked how SMEs can improve the legacy of major city events and prolong the positive impacts that come with hosting them.

Commenting on the new circular commitment for Glasgow, Councillor Susan Aitken said: “The First Minister has announced today that the opportunity for Scotland in embracing the circular economy runs into the billions of pounds. I want Glasgow to be at the forefront of seizing that opportunity.

“The work done by the Chamber of Commerce and Zero Waste Scotland in Circular Glasgow has already put us far ahead of most of our competitors but the opportunities really are limitless. Our Route Map will point a way to building better homes and communities, reducing food insecurity and playing our part in dealing with the world’s addiction to single-use plastic.

“Increasing the number of homes powered by renewable or circular energy to 15 per cent by 2030 is an ambitious target but we will need to be ambitious in the coming years.""

Speaking at the Circular Economy Hotspot on Wednesday (31 October), Rebecca Ricketts of the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce gave her top three tips to other cities looking to begin their circular transition.
• Use simple language – Ricketts said it was important to communicate the circular economy concept and its benefits in a clear and accessible manner. “Clear communication erases uncertainty and brings people together with a common sense of purpose,” she explained.
• Champion diversity – She spoke on “harnessing the power of crowds” through the Circle Lab, gathering expertise from “a melting pot of different perspectives, ideas and experiences”.
• Recruit local heroes – It’s important, Ricketts concluded, to find people who “champion and support your vision… Through a shared sense of purpose, and teamwork, collaborations can bring about some of the greatest results”.

This focus on collaboration was repeated throughout the Circular Economy Hotspot, including by keynote speaker Janez Potocnik, co-chair of the United Nations International Resource Panel (IRP) and, from 2010 to 2014, EU Commissioner for the Environment.

Potocnik spoke on his work pioneering the circular economy in Europe, saying that what was once “the dream of a few” was now “the reality of many”. With the EU’s comprehensive Circular Economy Package becoming law in June this year, and with delegates from around 20 countries worldwide attending the conference this week, the concept is clearly gathering momentum. But in order to stimulate further progress, Potocnik said, more cooperation is needed, because the world is “more interconnected and interdependent than ever”.

Building a global circular economy, he added, would be the most important instrument to deliver Sustainable Development Goal 12 (‘to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns’). He also stated that SDG 12 should be the central focus of governments going forward, as achieving sustainable resource use would have the widest impact across the other 16 goals.

To achieve this, Potocnik stated that circular economy route maps – like the one announced for Glasgow – should be present in every government, ensuring that the circular economy remains at the top of the agenda on city, country and global levels.",Colombia,2018.11
654,Circular economy in Scottish regions worth £1bn,"Adopting circular business practises in Scotland could be worth £1 billion to two regions alone, according to reports released yesterday (31 October).

Tayside, a region including Dundee and Perth, could see around a £400-million boost to its local economy if it adopts a circular approach to business, while £625 million of potential value is predicted for Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire in North East Scotland.

The figures come from two reports by the Scottish Government-funded circular economy organisation Zero Waste Scotland (ZWS), looking into the potential benefits of a circular economy in the cities and regions of Scotland, moving away from a traditional linear model of production, consumption and disposal towards a model where waste is diminished and natural resources are kept in use at a high value for as long as possible, through reuse, repair and remanufacture.

According to ZWS, a ‘cities and regions’ approach to implementing a circular economy is beneficial because it enables plans to be tailored to the different specialisms and resource bases of different regions. Key circular economy opportunities in both regions were identified in the construction, energy infrastructure, manufacturing and food and drink sectors.

For example, Tayside accounts for 70 per cent of the total land in Scotland used for growing soft fruit, and 49 per cent of land for growing potatoes – by-products and leftovers from these industries constitute ‘significant’ amounts of biomass and potential feedstock that could be recovered rather than going to waste.

In both Tayside and Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, a significant proportion of the potential economic benefit is located in the construction and built environment sector. Around £238 million is said to be achievable for the latter region in this industry, through measures such as designing new buildings with longevity and easy of maintenance in mind, repurposing obsolete or underused buildings for new, minimising waste and reusing materials.

The reports, produced in partnership with local Chambers of Commerce, were launched by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at the Circular Economy Hotspot 2018, an annual gathering of international experts in the circular economy, held in Glasgow on 31 October.

Sturgeon said: “These reports show the exciting potential of a circular economy where reducing waste and investing in keeping materials in circulation for as long as possible can release an estimated £1 billion of economic opportunities for Tayside, Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire. This demonstrates the overall scale of the opportunity for Scotland.

“Scotland is already leading the way with its ambitious and challenging targets for recycling which are above and beyond the EU targets. However, we want the narrative to move beyond recycling to reuse, repair and remanufacturing of items. In this light, we are currently considering next steps for introducing a deposit return scheme which will help us achieve our ambitions.”

Nicola Sturgeon speaking at the Circular Economy Hotspot in Glasgow £700k funding for three circular businesses

Investment in circular practises has been central to the government’s approach to business, with £70 million announced in 2016 for a Circular Economy Investment Fund and Service to support innovative small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) moving towards a circular economy. Four ‘Circular Regions’ have been set up across the country – Glasgow, Edinburgh, Tayside and the North East – each receiving targeted funding and support.

The latest round of support from the Investment Fund, announced at the Hotspot on Wednesday, saw £700,000 worth of funding for three businesses in Scotland already exemplifying circular economy concepts.
• Total Homes, a three-sector partnership delivering house clearances for Housing Associations in Glasgow, ensuring that household appliances, furniture and other goods are re-used;
• Revive Eco, which collects used coffee grounds from large coffee chains and independent cafes and recycles them to create high value bio-oils with a range of applications; and
• Angus 3D, a Tayside start-up aiming to bring the latest metal 3D printing technology to Scotland. This tech will reduce waste in the design process and extend the lifespan of machinery by allowing obsolete parts to be manufactured from 3D scans.

Pauline Smith, Director of Total Homes, said: “The investment from ZWS has allowed us to create a business that transforms the way items are currently disposed of from vacant housing association properties. 80 per cent of items which we take out, such as furniture, small electricals, kitchen utensils, textiles and toys, will be reused to support people being re-homed or simply providing an affordable way to refurnish their home.

“This service embraces the vision for a circular economy. When we clear properties, items are tested, repaired, cleaned or upcycled and continue in use instead of being landfilled.”

Iain Gulland, Chief Executive of ZWS, which administers the investment fund, commented: “It’s fantastic to be able to profile the work that’s being done in Scotland to kickstart the circular economy to a global audience… Our Circular Economy Investment Fund is helping to bring exciting new ideas to market and we are seeing ever greater interest from private backers, who recognise that the future is circular.

“The challenges in building a circular economy are big but they are only matched by the potential benefits to businesses”.

742,"How brands, retailers and resellers are combating overproduction –","Total sales of apparel in the U.S. are estimated to have grown by nearly 15 percent this year, yet for all the increased consumption, a major issue remains: Brands are producing far more product than they can ever sell.

A new report from retail software company ShareCloth revealed that nearly 30 percent of fashion goods produced go unsold. Furthermore, more than 50 percent of fast fashion sold is thrown out less than a year later, with 12.8 million tons of clothing annually dumped into landfills.

This chronic overproduction has obvious negative effects on the environment, emitting 1.2 billion tons of greenhouse gases each year into the atmosphere, but it also will have a negative effect on fashion brands’ profits in the long run, potentially making the industry lose out on $52 billion in revenue by 2030, according to ShareCloth’s report.

“It becomes a wasteful practice on a large scale when major brands are left with swaths of unsold product they can’t move, and have to sell at a discounted rate,” said Kerry Cooper, president and COO of Rothy’s. “In some cases, luxury brands even destroy millions of dollars of unwanted products per year to maintain the exclusivity of their products.”

Supply and demand

 The core of overproduction comes down to the lead times of designing and producing fashion collections, taking much longer than the trends that inspire those collections usually last. Often, it can be incredibly difficult to predict whether something you are designing now will be appealing a year later, when it’s finally sold.

Additionally, brands often must meet minimum order quantities that force them to produce more than they might actually need. The logistics of inventory management can lead to a large amount of overproduction.

“Inventory management is a huge challenge for brands and retailers,” said Larisa Summers, svp of e-commerce at Optoro, which owns an e-commerce platform called Blinq where customers can buy deadstock items destined for a landfill. “They plan as much as they can, but it’s nearly impossible to forecast quantities perfectly. This can lead to excess inventory, which needs to be dealt with efficiently so as to recover as much value as possible.”

For brands that own their own factories, like footwear brand Rothy’s, this process is much easier.

“We own and operate our own factory, ensuring flexibility with order size and timeline,” Cooper said. “We break our inventory into categories of product we are confident will sell and product we want to test so that we have a multi-speed supply chain. With the confident product, we can carry deeper inventory on it, and we shouldn’t be out of stock. With new product, we can post a new color or style on our website in the morning, gauge demand by early afternoon and have a finished pair of shoes in our distribution just four days later. If a certain color doesn’t resonate, we’re not stuck with truckloads of a shoe that won’t sell.”



Retail options

 For brands that do not have that option, however, there are still alternatives. For one, retailers like Blinq have allowed brands to sell their excess material to third parties who will handle selling it to consumers.

“Blinq offers brands and retailers the opportunity to sell excess and returned inventory directly to consumers who are specifically looking for these types of goods,” Summers said. “Blinq’s customers are motivated not only by the great deals they can get on these products, but they also care about reducing the amount of unused goods that end up in landfills.”

Some brands have made extensive use of deadstock as a way to keep their own waste production low. Public School, for example, has used deadstock heavily over the last year, winning an award from the CFDA for doing so.

Things like the sale of deadstock, which can give new life to the products that would otherwise end up sitting in a landfill for hundreds of years, or emerging data technologies, which can help brands more accurately predict exactly what and how much they need to produce in order to meet demand without vastly overestimating what demand, can all help alleviate the problem of overproduction.

Designing with resale in mind can also help prevent some of the more dire environmental effects of overproduction. The RealReal’s partnership with Stella McCartney, which the two just renewed for 2019, was built explicitly to help keep Stella’s clothes out of landfills and ensure that every piece got multiple uses in its lifetime.

“Brands should be coming together to figure out how we can change this. Participating in the circular economy is such a great way to do that,” said Rati Sahi Levesque, chief merchant of The RealReal. “We’re really all about encouraging others in the space to embrace the circular economy, and our partnership with Stella can be a source for inspiration or a model to replicate.”

The rise of streetwear and luxury drops, which rely explicitly on producing less than what is in demand in order to ensure that every last piece gets sold, could also lead luxury brands to curb their overproduction problems.

The risks of overproduction

 Ultimately, avoiding overproduction comes down to being smart about the process before any piece of clothing is made. If brands keep going down the same course they’re on, their profits — and, more importantly, the environment — stand to lose.

“Shorten the time from demand to production or localize manufacturing, which typically means maintaining close control of your supply chain,” Cooper said, when asked the best way for brands to curb their overproduction. “In addition, build in flexibility to be able to ‘chase’ product that is selling well to fulfill demand. The flexibility to operate with small-batch production is key.”",Colombia,2018.12
779,FEAD cautions against Norway Basel amendment on plastic waste,"A proposed amendment to the Basel Convention tabled by Norway has been criticised by the European Federation of Waste Management and Environmental Services (FEAD).

The organisation that represents Europe’s waste management companies, cautioned in a statement that the amendment, while well-intentioned, is ‘bound to miss its own objective’ and could ‘hinder the development of an EU market for plastic waste’.

The proposal itself, submitted in June by the government of Norway to the Basel Convention Secretariat, would see scrap plastics added to Annex II of the Basel Convention, meaning the material would join a list of wastes for ‘special consideration’ requiring notification by exporting countries and consent by importing countries prior to export in a move designed to to address the ocean plastic crisis.

The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal, which came into force in 1992, governs the shipment and trade of hazardous wastes.

According to Norway’s proposed amendment, plastic waste would fall under three categories in the Basel Convention:
• Single polymer uncontaminated plastic waste (a revised entry B3010 in Annex IX of the Convention);
• Plastic waste requiring special consideration, for all plastics not covered by entry AXXXX of Annex VIII or B3010 of Annex IX (new entry Y48 in Annex II); and

As part of the entry B3010, any waste that does not comply with the B3010 has to be regarded as ‘amber listed’, requiring exporters to apply the notification procedure. The proposal adds three new criteria to the B3010: mixing/contamination is forbidden if it ‘prevents the recycling of the waste in an environmentally sound manner’, plastic waste is limited to ‘R3 – operation’ (the Convention’s definition of recycling of organic substances not used as solvents, excluding recovery operations) and recycling operations may ‘only involve minimal further mechanical preparatory treatment processes, if any’.

FEAD provides responses to these proposals in a position paper on Norway’s proposal, which labels the forbidding of mixing and contamination as ‘confusing, subject to variable interpretation and to legal uncertainty’ and ‘strongly opposes’ limiting the use of the ‘green list’ procedure to recycling operations and excluding other recovery operations, meaning exporters would have to provide notification to export plastic waste destined for other recovery operations, which FEAD says could lead to an ‘accurate waste congestion’ for countries with limited recycling and recovery capacity, due partly to the time needed to approve a notification.

FEAD’s position paper also provides a number of objectives to assist the development of a European plastics waste market. It calls for:
• A robust impact assessment since the Norwegian proposal could negatively impact plastic recycling and recovery;
• Complementing measures to stimulate European demand for recycled materials and investment in recycling capabilities (e.g packaging and plastics from WEEE (waste electrical and electronic equipment);
• Sufficient lead in time to allow new recycling infrastructure to be built;
• A clear commitment by the EU to limit delays for notified shipments; and

FEAD has previously made high-level representations in order to push for simplified waste material trade rules and a stimulation of the European secondary material market, calling on the European Commission to simplify the Waste Shipment Regulation (WSR) and harmonise enforcement across EU member states in November, and calling on EU member states to implement an appropriate framework of ‘pull’ mechanisms to complement recycling targets in the Circular Economy Package in October of last year.

“We firmly believe that this proposal is bound to miss its own objective: to combat marine litter, countries need to work on improving and expanding their respective waste management and particularly recycling capabilities, firmly combat illegal dumping.

“To reduce the amounts of refuse going into the world’s oceans we need an effective enforcement of waste management legislation, the expansion of waste treatment infrastructure, dissemination of information and best practice, as well as educational measures.

“The Basel Convention currently consists of two main procedures for waste shipment, which are called ‘amber listed’ and ‘green listed’. The government of Norway’s proposal would introduce new waste category for plastics under the Basel Convention.

“Presently, plastics for recycling and plastics for recovery fall under the same category B3010. This category does not require a notification procedure. Norway would like for plastics destined for recovery to fall under the ‘Y48’ category, which does require a notification procedure.

""Norway’s proposal could unfortunately hinder the development of an EU market for plastic waste, by raising the administrative burden and the costs of shipping plastic waste, or by making them simply impossible. Therefore, the new entries need to be clear to avoid confusion and varying interpretations.

824,SEPA plans to make Scotland’s metal sector go circular,"The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) has devised a new sector plan to make Scotland’s metal sector part of the nation’s emerging circular economy and improve environmental compliance and prevent illegal activity within the industry.

SEPA launched The Metals Sector Plan on 10 November, and is one of SEPA’s 16 detailed plans for individual sectors, such as the landfill sector plan, produced in accordance with SEPA’s overarching strategy, One Planet Prosperity, which seeks to lay out a path for Scotland to achieve greater resource efficiency. This is in line with the Scottish government’s circular economy strategy, ‘Making Things Last’.

The Metals Sector Plan covers all regulated activities that involve the production of metal from raw materials, the manufacture of metal products and the reprocessing, recycling and recovery of metallic wastes. It aims to reduce the amount of materials, energy and water used across the metals sector through a range of ambitious goals. These include:
• Displacing virgin raw materials with recycled or recovered metals within the industry;
• Ensuring operators can better collect individual metal types and alloys;
• Saving energy by promoting industry best practice in energy efficiency and low carbon energy projects for the Scottish metal manufacturing processes; and
• Regulating baseline water use at metals production sites and improving water efficiency.

“Full compliance with environmental regulations will not, by itself, deliver the transformational change required to secure our One Planet Prosperity objectives,” said Terry A’Hearn, Chief Executive of SEPA. “The Metals Sector Plan needs to unlock the potential for businesses to gain strength in resource efficiency and environmental innovation that will help them to succeed in their markets.”

The sector plan also identifies particular areas of inefficiency. For example, it cites a University of Cambridge report which states that the current quality of recycled steel within the UK is low due to poor control of its composition. It also points out that materials separated from metals at reprocessing facilities, such as plastic, are often unnecessarily disposed of as waste.

The need to increase resource efficiency in the metals sector is clear as key materials, such as copper, lead, tin and lithium, which is fundamental to electric vehicle and renewable energy manufacturing, are all in short supply.

A’Hearn added: “As the world faces shortages in metals and environmental constraints on their use, we will encourage the development of new technologies and business models that reduce resource use and environmental impact in ways that meet market needs.”

Within its plan, SEPA states that metal recycling and reprocessing sites had an environmental compliance rate of 88 per cent in 2017, compared to the national average of 90.9 per cent. As SEPA states: ‘This means that the sector is currently underperforming and that there are a number of operators that consistently perform poorly.’

A range of issues can contribute to non-compliance, such as storage of polluted waste on permeable ground, the non-provision of an impermeable surface, waste duty of care failing, issues with waste data reporting and administration, and the failure to depollute end-of-life vehicles.

Illegal activity can range from the small-scale breaking of vehicles to resell their separate parts, to industrial estates where unlicensed end-of-life vehicle (ELVs) operations take place. Initial assessment suggests that some are involved in wider criminality and a few have links to serious and organised crime groups and are a known violence and aggression risk.

The export of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), ELVs and vehicle parts are also susceptible to illegal activity and there is concern that some operators are still paying cash for metal, which has been banned since 2016, or do not have a Scrap Metal Dealers licence from their local authority.

A’Hearn adds: “Metals is a sector with a highly varied environmental performance. At one end, there are responsible operators who have a good track record of compliance and are seeking new business opportunities based on solving environmental challenges. At the other end, there are those who undertake activities illegally, ‘outside the system’, creating environmental risks and undermining legitimate operators.

“In the plan, we set out the ways we will try to get these illegal operators into the system or out of the market. This is tough work. We will use a combination of approaches and work with other organisations to try to achieve this aim. We will also drive those legitimate operators with outstanding compliance issues to solve them.”

SEPA’s plan to improve compliance and tackle illegal activity includes proposals to develop effective intervention strategies to tackle and deter illegal practices with Police Scotland, local authorities, the DVLA, industry trade bodies and other UK environment agencies, as well as making it easier for operators to understand their obligations through permit simplification and improved guidance on environmental compliance, and increasing scrutiny of duty of care compliance.

853,SEPA releases landfill sector plan,"The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) has launched a new sector plan for Scotland’s landfill waste sector in a bid to drive environmental compliance at sites, harness innovation and help the sector responsibly manage site closures and aftercare.

SEPA’s Landfill Sector Plan, released today (10 December) is one of 16 sector plans being launched this year as part of the regulator’s One Planet Prosperity strategy.

In response to mounting scientific evidence about climate change, resource scarcity and security, the sector plans set out a range of actions to help all regulated businesses meet – and go beyond – their compliance obligations.

There are currently 55 operational landfill sites and 217 non-operational sites regulated by SEPA in Scotland. Around four million tonnes of waste still enter Scotland’s landfills every year, though SEPA expects between 1.3-2 million tonnes of waste move from landfill every year over the next three years as a result of the Scottish Government’s 2021 ban on the landfilling of biodegradable waste.

The move is part of the Scottish Government’s circular economy strategy, ‘Making things last’, which includes aims to limit the amount of waste going to landfill to five per cent by 2025 and to reduce food waste by a third in the same timeframe.

In its Landfill Sector Plan, SEPA sets out a number of actions to improve compliance – and to go beyond compliance to help Scotland achieve its circular economy ambitions. These include:
• Focusing regulatory effort, including enforcement interventions, at sites with the worst compliance records and those with greatest community impact;
• Supporting operators to prepare for the ban on landfilling biodegradable municipal waste from 1 January 2021 and the target of no more than five per cent residual waste to landfill by 2025;
• Working with operators to ensure that all extractable landfill gas is utilised or, where this is not technically feasible, converted into less harmful gases;
• Identifying opportunities to help the landfill sector to develop and share best practice examples that support compliant operations;
• Developing effective intervention strategies to disrupt and deter illegal activity in partnership with Police Scotland, local authorities, industry trade bodies, other UK environment agencies and other relevant partners;
• Working with partners to support development of alternative products for landfill engineering, potentially reducing the reliance on virgin quarried clay;
• Developing a forum for businesses to work in partnership with SEPA and other stakeholders to consider the sources of the energy used, with the aim of moving away from fossil fuels; and
• Working co-operatively with the landfill sector, communities and other partners to promote and develop sustainable land uses for restored landfills.

Commenting on the sector plan, SEPA Chief Executive Terry A’Hearn said: “This plan is ambitious. It spells out how we will use our full suite of regulatory powers, including the creation of a new national enforcement team, in clearer and more powerful ways. It also sets out some new ways such as novel partnerships that we will develop and use to support innovation and transformation in this sector.



“As Scotland’s environmental regulator, we’ll work to ensure operators protect the environment from the impacts of landfilling and ensure that communities are safeguarded. As some wastes break down, they produce powerful emissions such as leachate (a highly polluting liquid that poses a risk to downgrading surface water quality and groundwater aquifers if not adequately contained, extracted and treated) and powerful greenhouse gases such as methane that contribute to climate change.

“The transition to a circular economy is an environmental and economic win-win for Scotland. That said, it’s important that we work to ensure operators responsibly manage site closures and aftercare.”

894,Zero Waste Europe calls for carpet industry to go circular,"A collaborative group of carpet manufacturers, industry associations and members of civil society are working together to urge the European Commission and EU member states to make the carpet industry circular by introducing mandatory rules across Europe.

A call to action launched by Zero Waste Europe (ZWE), a European network of communities and local leaders working towards a completely circular economy, has already received support from DSM-Niaga, a science and technology circular economy enterprise, sustainable carpet manufacturers Interface, and Tarkett, a carpet and flooring specialist.

ZWE’s idea was a direct response to Eunomia’s publication, 'Policy toolkit for carpet circularity in EU member states', released on December 4 (yesterday). The toolkit provides a range of options for policy-makers to choose from, with the aim of accelerating the circular economy in the carpet sector while simultaneously helping to achieve the EU waste recycling and landfilling targets – a concept made all the more pressing considering 14 countries risk missing their 2020 EU recycling targets.

Joan Marc Simon, Executive Director at ZWE, said: “Current legislative and economic frameworks in the carpet sector lock the industry into a wasteful linear system. To build a true Circular Economy we need new rules and incentives to bring the whole sector to a higher level of ambition. This is why we support the measures proposed in the Eunomia toolkit, and we call on the European Commission and Member States to set the legal framework that will make the carpet sector go circular.”

Through the European Commission and member states, ZWE hopes to have all carpet companies agree to several mandatory rules by 2025. The rules would state that all commercial and household carpets put on the market should be: free of potentially harmful chemicals; reusable; separately collected; and fully recyclable.

This would entail a gradual phasing out of virgin materials, and a transition towards safe and healthy components that include an increasing rate of recycled or renewable content – but this can only be truly effective as a sustainable idea if adopted across the entire carpet industry.

As Myriam Tryjefaczka, Sustainability and Public Affairs Director at Tarkett EMEA, said: “Material transparency, eco-design and either closed or open loops are fundamental to develop a healthy and circular economy in the long run.”

ZWE, DSM-Niaga, Interface and Tarkett all support the use of transparent Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes, which would create necessary incentives to drive this transition. These companies commit to supporting the EPR schemes in countries that are considering introducing mandatory measures which would allow the carpet sector to go circular.

Lukas Hoex, Manager of Strategic Growth at DSM-Niaga, said: “DSM-Niaga is concerned about carpet waste, and believes producer responsibility is a big part of the solution. Manufacturers of any kind of product, also carpet, have to design and make products with recycling in mind, and support the collection of products after use. Mandatory disclosure of ingredients is in our view an urgent party of extended producer responsibility, since it supports the consumer to make better choices and then supports recyclers to handle products in the right way.”

Meanwhile at Interface, circular solutions are already in place. Geanne van Arkel, Head of Sustainable Development in Interface EMEA, said: “We’ve instituted circular solutions to creating products including identification and elimination of materials of concern, introduction of recycled materials and new processes to reclaim and reuse products across our global business.

“As a result, 58 per cent of raw materials in our products are recycled or bio-based. By creating modular flooring products that can be installed, replaced, reused and recycled simply we are leading our industry to design with the planet and people in mind. This transformative approach shows it is possible to make a profit sustainably. If we can do this, other businesses can too.”",Colombia,2018.12
3,Scottish lighting company develops circular LED business model,"Glasgow-based EGG Lighting has developed a new circular business model that could see businesses save on LED lighting, while reducing their carbon footprint.

For six months, EGG has been testing its circular economy business model with help from the Scottish logistics, construction and distribution specialists W H Malcolm. The trial has been supported by Zero Waste Scotland, the European Regional Development Funds and the Scottish Government.

EGG’s circular business model has introduced a new modular approach to lighting, which sees only the LED and driver parts replaced, leaving the rest of the unit in place. The company is also pioneering a ‘lighting as a service’ model that would see businesses continue to receive regular upgrades to the technology, but without having to replace the entire unit. This allows businesses to upgrade their LED technology without having to constantly pay for new lights and without having to dispose of the entire unit.

One of the main successes of the trial has been the use of dynamic zone control, which sees lighting adapt to how space is used, saving around 70 per cent on the running cost of lights.

In the UK some 48.5 per cent of lamps are recycled, with 6,132 tonnes of waste collected for recycling. Uptake of LED lighting is rapidly increasing as it is much more energy efficient and longer lasting than old fluorescent-style lights. However, waste levels are also increasing due to the technology advancing at a rapid rate, requiring businesses to making regular upgrades.

Commenting on the project, Iain Gulland, Chief Executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “Continuous innovation doesn’t have to mean continuous waste. By factoring future improvements into their designs, EGG Lighting is helping to make their product fit to last. Their work shows that cutting out waste and changing how we deliver services can deliver clear economic savings in the long run, with benefits for both the supplier and the customer.”

Brian O'Reilly, Managing Director, EGG Lighting, said: “Just as you get a new smartphone every year, so there are constant updates to lighting technology. But shelling out for the latest technology year on year is expensive to the end user and wasteful for the supplier. We want to give businesses the benefits of the latest technology without them having to upgrade their hardware. Zero Waste Scotland’s support has helped us prepare this technology for the market, and we’re looking forward to rolling it out to more clients.”

EGG’s trial of its new business model has received funding from the Circular Economy Investment Fund, which is part of the £73-million Resource Efficient Circular Economy Accelerator Programme, and represents but the latest example of the Scottish Government’s investment in circular economy initiatives across the country.",Colombia,2018.12
23,Is price the sole determiner of luxury? –,"Last week, influencers gathered for the launch of a new luxury footwear brand called Palessi, selling shoes for hundreds of dollars. Of course, Palessi was fake — a ruse created by Payless to showcase that its affordable shoes were just as good as (or at least good enough to pass for) luxury shoes.

While this stunt may have gotten Payless some publicity, along with providing a little schadenfreude toward the wealthy shoppers who were duped into buying a $20 pair of shoes for almost $700, it also begs the question of luxury’s complicated relationship with price. Does something have to be expensive to be luxury? Are “luxury” and “affordable” mutually exclusive descriptors?

“There has definitely been a shift in how consumers think about luxury,” said Brian Lee, associate director at Gartner L2. “There has been a ‘democratization’ of luxury fashion, where it is no longer exclusive to people of a certain socio-economic class or group. Due to increasing accessibility and knowledge, primarily through digital channels like online e-commerce, resale and social media, more and more consumers are able to shop luxury products to varying degrees.”

Accessibility vs. exclusivity

 That democratization has taken many forms. Resale sites like The RealReal have given more customers than ever access to products from premium luxury houses at a cost that is more affordable. Luxury brands do not often discount their products due to the perceived damage to their brand image that would ensue. That is why luxury brands often sit out of Black Friday. The so-called circular economy has given rise to a large new segment of consumers who are wearing and evangelizing luxury brands, despite not having paid an exorbitant price for it.

“Rent the Runway has a similar effect of creating more familiarity between designer brands and consumers who may not have worn items at as high a price point as before,” said Lauren Price, director of client strategy at Gartner L2. “But there is a notable lack of premium luxury brands on Rent the Runway, as these brands want to maintain that exclusivity.”

Thanks to accessibility of luxury, the question of what the term means has become more individualized. Some, like Italic’s Jeremy Cai, view luxury as something that is aspirational, which changes based on your income level and tastes.

The luxury experience

 Luxury can also refer to the quality of the experience that comes along with the product. The service a customer receives when they enter the store, a personalized note from the brand or even beautiful packaging can all be symbols of luxury that are distinct from price and quality of the product.

“There’s a lot more investment in packaging today, and that’s something that can give the same sort of feeling of a luxury brand,” said Corey Pierson, co-founder and CEO of customer intelligence platform Custora. “There are a lot of brands outside of fashion that are not what you might call luxury but are creating customer experiences that are on par with luxury brands.

“I subscribe to a coffee-of-the-month club, and every month it arrives in this beautiful package with a handwritten note from the owner of the company explaining what the coffee is. That’s creating an absolutely luxurious experience. Customer experience is an integral part to creating the feeling of luxury.”

Streetwear’s disruption

 One of the biggest disruptors in the relationship between luxury and price is streetwear. Brands that are typically priced much lower than luxury brands compete for the same customers and are spoken of in the same breath.

“A classic example would be Supreme, where MSRP is generally affordable and comparable to many other affordable brands, but they compete with luxury brands due to brand cachet and scarcity due to limited product and distribution,” said Price. “It is in resale when prices ramp up significantly. Similarly, limited-edition shoes and collaborations also create opportunities for non-luxury brands to target the luxury market without necessarily having a luxury price point.”

Sneakers, in particular, add more confusion to the price situation. The majority of people who own Yeezy sneakers probably paid between $700 and $1,000 dollars for a pair, which places them firmly in luxury price territory. But those sales come through the bustling resale market. The actual retail price of the sneakers is usually less than $300. While the actual price may be relatively low, most people will probably pay luxury prices for them.

As the circular economy grows, streetwear continues to dominate fashion and younger generations of consumers with radically different views on their relationship with brands become more central in fashion, luxury must rethink its own relationship with price in order to remain relevant. Ultimately, elements outside of price will be just as, if not more, important to what constitutes luxury, although price may never truly go out the window as a factor in what makes something luxurious.

“Luxury, more than ever in its history, should be defined as a state of mind, just as much as by its hallmarks: exclusivity, craftsmanship, price, quality,” said Chris Paradysz, founder of PMX Agency. “While these have always been true, luxury’s accessibility through technology innovations plus consumer behavioral changes have disrupted its purity. Price still differentiates, but it’s no longer joined at the hip with exclusivity.”",Colombia,2018.12
187,"Countries need to become circular to avoid climate change, says report","A new report into the global circular economy shows that governments could avoid drastic climate change by encouraging reuse and the recycling of natural resources – but that we are a long way off from seeing the circular economy in practice around the world.



While the term ‘circular economy’ might not be common household utterance yet, the ideas behind it – keeping natural resources in use for as long as possible through re-use or recycling rather than continually extracting and consuming new ones – are certainly becoming more popular, especially with the problem of single-use plastic waste continuing to dominate environmental agendas.

It is at the national level that circular practices could have a significant impact, according to Dutch social enterprise Circle Economy, helping to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions across the globe. Emissions are closely linked to resource use; analysis by Circle Economy suggests that 62 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions (excluding those from land use and forestry) are released during the ‘extraction, processing and manufacturing of goods to serve society’s needs’.

Read more: Resource efficiency fastest way to cut carbon emissions

The historic Paris Climate Agreement of 2015 aims to limit global temperature increases to ‘well below’ two degrees above pre-industrial levels. A report last year by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) confirmed that 1.5 degrees was the very maximum rise that the world could take before devastating effects would be induced – and said we have only 12 years to ensure this limit.

However, global resource use is increasing; the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) stated in October 2018 that the world’s consumption of raw materials is set to double by 2060. And Circle Economy’s new report claims that only nine per cent of the world economy is circular – in other words, only nine per cent of the natural resources that enter the economy every year are being reused.

The ‘Circularity Gap Report 2019’ was launched today (22 January) at the start of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The findings of the report show no improvement from the previous year’s results, with the upward trend in resource extraction and carbon emissions continuing.

Circle Economy is calling on governments to improve their circular approach, especially in the built environment (meaning the human-made space around us – the construction and maintenance of houses, offices, roads and infrastructure). This area has the largest resource footprint, especially in the developing world.

Three main strategies are proposed in the report for governments to implement a circular economy:
• Optimising the utility of products by maximising their use and extending their lifetime;
• Enhanced recycling, using waste as a resource; and

Circle Economy’s CEO, Harald Friedl, explained: “A 1.5-degree world can only be a circular world. Recycling, greater resource efficiency and circular business models offer huge scope to reduce emissions. A systemic approach to applying these strategies would tip the balance in the battle against global warming.

“Governments’ climate change strategies have focused on renewable energy, energy efficiency and avoiding deforestation but they have overlooked the vast potential of the circular economy. They should re-engineer supply chains all the way back to the wells, fields, mines and quarries where our resources originate so that we consume fewer raw materials. This will not only reduce emissions but also boost growth by making economies more efficient.”

Some governments have begun to take notice of the circular economy concept – the Netherlands is aiming to become 50 per cent circular by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2050. The EU’s Circular Economy Package was signed off last year and aims to reduce the Union’s ‘dependence on the import of raw materials and facilitate the transition to more sustainable material management’.

However, there is a long way to go before concrete results will be seen from this legislation in Europe. Friedl commented: “Huge work remains to be done in established economies where the priority is to make better use of existing infrastructure. At the same time it’s crucial that we work with emerging economies to avoid mistakes made in the past.

“Now is the time to replace traditional building methods with state-of-the-art practices which will not lock in high emissions for decades to come. Countries will make maximum impact by designing not just homes, buildings and infrastructure but whole cities for maximum resource efficiency.”

299,J. Crew tackles sustainability with denim buyback program –,"J. Crew debuted this week a new program in partnership with Habitat for Humanity, in which it buys back old pairs of jeans to be recycled into insulation material for the housing company.

J. Crew has only dabbled in denim recycling thus far. Since 2014, J. Crew has offered a limited denim recycling program with a company called Blue Jeans Go Green, which recycles the material. The new effort brings in Habitat for Humanity, which will help ensure that all of the recycled denim gets put to good use.

To incentivize customers to recycle their denim with J. Crew, the brand is offering $20 toward a new pair of jeans for every pair brought in. That’s generous, compared to like programs by brands like Rag & Bone and A.P.C., which only offer a percentage discount, usually around 10-20 percent (although A.P.C. offers 50 percent for some styles) on future purchases. Any pair of jeans can be turned in, not just pairs purchased at J. Crew. Other brands, including the aforementioned Rag & Bone and A.P.C., typically require that the recycled product be from the brand.

This is a big swing for J. Crew, which has continued to live in the shadow of its far more successful sister brand Madewell. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, J. Crew’s sales dropped by 5 percent while Madewell’s grew by 29 percent.

“Our denim recycling program allows us to help our customers dispose of waste responsibly by giving their jeans a new life in the form of housing insulation and keeping them out of landfills,” said Gonzalo Pertile, director of corporate social responsibility at J.Crew. “This is one of the steps we’re taking as we embark in our sustainability journey. We believe that some challenges require strong partnerships to make the most meaningful impact.”

J. Crew’s denim recycling efforts are in line with a trend running through the fashion industry toward minimizing the amount of waste and excess material introduced into circulation. Ever since the Burberry clothes-burning scandal in July, fashion consumers have become more aware of the problem of wasted excess clothing. Buyback programs like J. Crew’s recycling initiative are common, but they do not address a related problem: the overproduction of goods.

J. Crew has a reputation for constant sales and the heavy movement of product, which can be a signal of an overproduction problem. According to a December 2018 report from retail software company ShareCloth, 12.8 million tons of clothing are dumped into landfills each year. Brands typically struggle with accurately gauging exactly how much product they will need to make, and so they produce far too much of it, much of which goes unsold or is thrown out soon after being worn.

“The key is to design clothes from the offset that can be recycled and to slow down the fashion cycles,” said Diana Verde Nieto, co-founder and CEO of Positive Luxury, an organization promoting sustainability within luxury fashion. “Do we really need eight collections a year? The circular economy is a reality. In my view, more and more companies should really understand the adoptions of those principals when designing and manufacturing collections.”

J. Crew’s denim recycling program is generous. Twenty dollars per pair of jeans, even those not from the brand, is a significant investment in taking some of the excess product that might otherwise end up in a landfill out of circulation and putting it toward a good cause. But, up until now, J. Crew’s larger sustainability efforts have been lacking.

An analysis last August by Good On You, a company that rates brands based on their sustainability efforts, pointed out that J. Crew has ill-defined policies on how its goods are to be produced and what level of emissions stem from its production processes. Removing existing jeans from circulation is admirable, but it does not address the problem of producing far too much product to begin with.

“We are conscious of the large amounts of textiles that are thrown out every year in the world, so as apparel brands, we need to find new ways to help,” said Pertile. “Our partnerships with Habitat for Humanity and Blue Jeans Go Green are together just one step that we are taking to try and make an impact where we can.”

Still, becoming a sustainable brand is a process, and some brands do far less than what J. Crew’s new buyback program is doing to reduce the amount of apparel waste in landfills. As sustainability becomes increasingly important to consumers, brands have to work toward creating more comprehensive sustainabilty goals.

“Ideally, they would do more, but it’s great that J. Crew is taking this initiative,” Nieto said. “Creating a new line from pre-loved clothes while also encouraging consumers to create an emotional bond to the brand, is a smart move and puts pressure to other brands to do the same.”",Colombia,2019.01
305,University of Sheffield to lead £3.6m circular economy project,"A new EU project led by the University of Sheffield is hoping to facilitate Europe’s transition towards a circular economy.

The €4-million (£3.6-million) project, Realising the Transition to the Circular Economy (ReTracCE), is aiming to support the implementation of the EU’s Circular Economy Package, which was adopted in July 2018 and contains stricter recycling targets for all EU member states, as well as a new Plastics Strategy designed to tackle the growing problem of single-use plastic waste littering the natural environment.

Professor Andrea Genovese, from the University of Sheffield’s Management School and Principal Investigator of the ReTraCE initiative, explained: “This project will directly facilitate the implementation of the recently adopted ambitious Circular Economy Strategy of the European Commission, which is closely linked to the Sustainable Development Goals – the blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all.

“Looking beyond the current take-make-dispose extractive industrial model, a circular economy is an alternative to a traditional linear economy. It aims to redefine growth, focusing on positive society-wide benefits, where products are kept in use for as long as possible, with value recovery and regeneration at the end of their useful life.”

Led by the University of Sheffield, ReTraCE will bring together seven academic and three non-academic groups from across Europe, including the University of Kassel in Germany, the University of Kent and Tata Steel. Funding comes from Horizon 2020, an EU research and innovation project, through its Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks programme.

These partners will come together to design and deliver training to 15 early-stage researchers, with a goal to furthering understanding, discussion and action around the circular economy. Ultimately, the project hopes to develop insights into how a circular economy can be realised through both existing organisations and new business models.

By the end of the project, which will last for 48 months, the researchers will be able to share their circular economy expertise with other research institutions as well as public sector bodies and manufacturing and service industries.",Colombia,2019.01
364,Within difficulty lies opportunity: How Brexit could drive the UK circular economy,"Roger Morton, Director of Axion Polymers, explains what opportunities for the UK waste and resources sector could arise out of the UK’s departure from the EU.

With Brexit looming large on the horizon, I believe that the UK’s departure from the EU offers fresh opportunities for our nation and its manufacturers to secure their raw material supplies, such as recycled plastics, from a stable domestic market and stimulate a circular flow of materials.

With uncertainty persisting around the whole Brexit process, there could be potential difficulties in transporting material across borders after 29 March 2019. However, from a more optimistic viewpoint, such logistics should become a driver for growth in the domestic market as purchasers seek to reduce inward material supply chain risk.

Freedom from regulatory controls and external policies, coupled with the ability to set our own rules, could encourage greater investment and enable the UK to ‘get ahead of the rest of Europe’ in material recovery and resource security, provided there is strong government leadership.

Recyclers, like ourselves, who process waste materials derived from within this country are arguably in a stronger ‘self-reliant’ position than those who rely on external supply chains or import goods from abroad. We extract plastics from end-of-life cars and other metal scrap to produce polymers that are reused in a variety of other goods, including automotive parts.

With 31.5 million cars currently on UK roads, our future end-of-life vehicle feedstock for our recycled polymers is assured. And that can only be good news for UK companies seeking to use locally-sourced plastic raw materials that can go back into a range of products, from new cars and electrical equipment to construction products.

Brexit is inevitable now. Although complications could arise, we are taking a positive approach. British companies should focus on the opportunity that leaving the EU offers and how we can make the most of our resource sustainable position.

A good example here is steel. With annual consumption (12 million tonnes) versus annual arisings (11.5 million tonnes), this market could be much more ‘circular’ than the existing export of scrap/import of finished products model. Similarly, demand creation for the use of recycled polymers in new automotive, electrical and building products could encourage further investment in more processing plants to produce plastics for new UK-produced goods.

While material quality controls, such as REACH regulations and other standards, should remain ‘mirrored with Europe’, I suggest there could be an opportunity to take the lead by designing and implementing a set of regulatory measures that drive the transition to a circular economy here.

Such measures could involve heavily-modulated producer responsibility obligations for brands that make the most effort to change to fully recyclable designs and/or utilise high levels of recycled content. This would require vision and a brave government with strong leadership, but in an uncertain world, what’s certain is that material would be available in the UK for use in the UK.

One of the long-term benefits of Brexit should be that we can stop mass exports of waste plastic packaging and WEEE, and start investing in recycling infrastructure in the UK as an ‘environmental goal’. While 63 per cent of collected UK plastic packaging resources is currently exported, the country is short of around 10 to 15 large-scale recycling plants to handle that volume.

Additionally, we don’t have enough energy-from-waste capacity to handle the low-grade reject plastic stream produced by those plants – around 50 per cent of their waste infeed tonnage. So strategic government thinking and stable long-term policy measures and clear goals for the five to ten years will be needed to drive this change.

There is an opportunity for the UK Government to drive the development of recycling demonstration and pilot ‘pathfinder’ plants once we are free of ’state aid’ regulations that prevent preferential treatment by governments.

UK businesses need to wake up to these future possibilities and start talking to UK-based suppliers that can offer secure supplies of high-quality and resource-efficient recycled materials.

From our own perspective, we have seen an increase in enquiries and interest from UK manufacturers in recent months. And perhaps other recyclers have experienced this too.

Despite current uncertainty around Brexit, we remain upbeat about the opportunities to trigger more material moving within the circular economy in the UK.",Colombia,2019.01

Inevitably, this requires a vast amount of raw material inputs, which, among other things, explains why such a large amount of our recyclable material is shipped there, using the very containers that delivered the manufactured products here in the first place.

Taiwan, one of the engine rooms in this story, has provided a crucible for steady innovation in product design and techniques that make more use of waste resources and reduce the need for virgin material.

A major step on this journey was the decision to hold Circular Economy Taiwan, its first exhibition and conference on the circular economy, to showcase these developments for international businesses.

Addressing delegates at the opening, James Huang, Chairman of the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) that organised the event, observed that the country ‘lacks a lot of the natural resources it needs, creating a need to embrace the circular economy’.

The event was officially opened by the country’s President, Dr Tsai Ing-wen, who highlighted the Taiwanese Government’s commitment to maximising the use of waste resources. She said that embracing the circular economy would bring results in many industries and enthusiastically cited the example of how 16 of the 32 teams at the 2018 FIFA World Cup wore kit that was made in Taiwan from recycled plastic bottles. Reflecting the industriousness of the island, a wide range of innovations and their producers were on display. Here is a selection of some that caught the eye.

Perhaps most prominent has been the role played by Taiwan’s Environment Protection Agency (EPA) in driving forward solutions and activity, claiming its share of credit for a municipal solid waste recycling rate that now stands at over 52 per cent. According to last year’s report by Eunomia, currently only Germany has a higher rate.

However, what is unusual is its powerful cross-cutting remit, from managing regulation and environment quality – similar to the comparable agencies in other countries, such as the Environment Agency in the UK – while also playing a market development role for recyclate, including the management of a Recycling Fund to support different recycling activities, including innovations.

Among the companies showcased by EPA, UWin Nanotech’s patented techniques for efficiently recovering gold, silver, palladium and other valuable metals from printed circuit boards (PCBs) are rightly already attracting a lot of interest from companies in China, the US and Eastern Europe. Unlike the established technique for doing this using high temperatures, UWin’s process involves washing PCBs with chemicals, then running a current through the solution. The metals are subsequently collected through an electroplating technique.

This process contrasts sharply with current approaches currently dominating the market for recovering value from electronic waste, reducing the use of energy and the release of harmful by-products that characterise recovery elsewhere, such as effluents containing cyanide.

Also on show was a process developed by Taiwan’s Industrial Technology Research Institute for completely recapturing and recycling all materials from end-of- life LCD displays through a procedure in many ways analogous to that used for recovering metals from PCBs, involving the use of chemicals to wash and concentrate the materials returning it for use in making further LCD displays with no loss in quality.

An alternate use of the recovered liquid crystal demonstrated was its application in smart windows, which makes use of the photoelectric properties of the material to create windows that can be switched between opaque and transparent modes.

The recovered LCD glass is itself modified to become nano-porous glass adsorbent material used for adsorbing heavy metals more than 50 mg/g. This technique is used for removing contaminants from soil and water.

Inevitably, new approaches for managing the growing concern that surrounds the use of plastic were on display. Among them was the synthetic textile company Far Eastern New Century, which currently produces over two million tonnes of polyester each year.

Recognising the need to transition to a more sustainable model, New Century has developed techniques for recycling waste polymers. The company’s new technique can help recycle polyester from all types of used textiles, including mixed streams, through a dissolving process using non-complex solvents. Dyes and other polymers are filtered out and the resulting polyester recycled back into clothing, such as the football jerseys used by half the teams in the 2018 World Cup as part of its partnership with Adidas.

One aspect of this relationship with the sportswear company has been the creation of a special product line for trainers using plastic reclaimed from the coasts around the Maldives (including fishing nets and PET bottles). The collaboration recycled over 1,000 tonnes in 2017, with targets in place to significantly increase this as part of Adidas’ focus on raising awareness of issues surrounding ocean plastics.

In a similar vein, another innovation on show at the expo was SCafe’s use of waste coffee grounds to create fabrics for outdoor clothing. Using a patented process, coffee grounds are added to fabric yarn, which alters the shape of the filament. The resulting fabric has some particular enhanced properties, reducing the amount of sweat the garment will absorb and reducing the drying time, which makes the material (sold under the brand name of SINGTEX) suitable for sports clothing.

Also among the highlights of plastic substitutes was a packaging substitute material developed by eTouch Innovation Company called Fiber Particulate Composite (FPC), which Gordon Yu, the company’s Chairman, was at pains to stress was also an alternative to the use of polylactic acid (the base chemical used in bioplastics).

“Agricultural waste material, such as rice and wheat husks, is combined with what we call compatibiser, which is a converted starch with no man-made chemicals added,” explained Yu. He demonstrated a wide variety of products that used this, from food packaging trays and coffee cups to flip flops, bike pedals and golf tees. The latter he claimed “degrades in six months to a year, to become fertiliser”.

Continuing the theme of using waste resources for sporting apparel, tyre reprocessor Enrestec displayed its industrial process for creating a raw material to be used in the manufacture of wetsuits. The company’s factory separates vehicle tyres into their constituent parts: oil, carbon black, metal and cotton lint. Although the use of oil as a fuel in the plant counts against its environmental credentials, the application of a specialised pyrolysis technique to capture carbon black opens up new markets for waste tyres as a raw material. This carbon black, a fine powder, is used by Sheico, one of the world’s leading diving-suit manufacturers, as the company aims to reduce the environmental footprint of the wetsuits for brands such as Patagonia.

Another noteworthy application in Taipei was the innovative use of glass from material recovery facilities (MRFs) – though it’s worth noting MRF material is much less contaminated in Taiwan due to the lack of compaction in recycling collections. Once the glass has been separated and cleaned, it is combined with a carbon-based forming agent at high temperatures to produce a construction brick. The resulting brick, sold under the Anxin brand name, is one eighth of the weight of a conventional brick with a significant uplift in conventional insulation characteristics.

Although the concept of the circular economy is nothing new, it’s fair to say that the approach has only come of age over the past decade. It’s no surprise to discover that a country known as one of the world’s factories has perhaps a keener sense of the value in adopting this thinking, as it seeks to satisfy its voracious appetite for raw materials at a time when sustainability demands we look for solutions from waste. While many of the purported innovations on show were nothing new, in many cases it seems that necessity is the mother of invention.",Colombia,2019.01
725,How fashion brand For Days is scaling its circular business model –,"For Days, the circular membership T-shirt brand launched in September of 2018, gives its customers an unlimited rotation of shirts: They’re sent back to the company, recycled and replenished. Now, the company is licensing its circular business model to other fashion brands.

This week, For Days, which raised nearly $3 million in funding at the end of 2018 from Allbirds investor Rosecliff Ventures, began working with 2-year-old DTC bra brand Harper Wilde to implement a circular model for the brand’s bras. Since Jan. 17, Harper Wilde customers have been able to pack up old bras and send them to the brand to be recycled, rather than toss them in the garbage to languish for years.

Unlike For Days, this is not a recurring membership service. Instead, every Harper Wilde purchase comes with a box and shipping label for sending old bras, not just ones bought from Harper Wilde, back to the brand. The bras are recycled into new material, which is used to create new bras. The initiative has seen most of its advertising through Harper Wilde’s Instagram, which highlights For Days’ role in the recycling process.

“We view For Days as a platform for a closed-loop lifestyle, and our aim is to shift how people think about their clothes with a focus on sustainability,” said Kristy Caylor, co-founder and CEO of For Days. “As a brand, we are planning for expansion into a broader range of basics this spring, and we will continue to expand as far as we can innovate on materials, manufacturing and up-cycling.”

Harper Wilde worked with For Days to bring this style of circular fashion to its customers, citing the need to avoid placing old bras and underwear in landfills where they can take up to 200 years to break down naturally. The desire to curb the excess material produced and get the most use out of products that already exist is one conscious brands have been capitalizing on for some time now, to the point where some brands have begun making recycling a part of the design process from the beginning.

For example, J. Crew expanded its denim buyback and recycling program in mid-January, and ThredUp debuted a new collection last October that was made to be recycled, resold and re-worn multiple times.

“The key is to design clothes from the offset that can be recycled and to slow down the fashion cycles,” said Diana Verde Nieto, co-founder and CEO of Positive Luxury, an organization promoting sustainability within luxury fashion. “Do we really need eight collections a year? The circular economy is [now] a reality. More companies should really understand the adoptions of these principles when designing and manufacturing collections.”

The circular approach to commerce, where customers can buy or rent things and return them to be recycled or reused by other customers has become a major focus in fashion. Some have argued that a shift in consumer sentiment toward sustainability, particularly among Gen Z, is part of the reason that streetwear has become so popular: Resale and limited-quantity drops can be more sustainable since they give clothes a longer shelf life and prevent overproduction. Despite this, streetwear brands seem to be the least inclined to make any sort of public efforts toward making their business more sustainable.

For Days has made its reputation on its selling its own clothes, and Caylor said that will remain a priority for the future. The partnership with Harper Wilde is a new direction for the company that opens possibilities; For Days is now helping other brands tap into For Days’ circular business model.

“Harper Wilde is the first brand we’ve partnered with, and it came about very organically,” Caylor said. “It was pretty simple. They wanted to divert bras from landfills, and we stepped in to help make that happen.”

Caylor would not go into details about how the actual recycling process works, citing legal issues, and she declined to share any potential future partnerships. She did say that the partnership with Harper Wilde is the first step in a larger strategy of working with other brands to create an in-house circulation and recycling infrastructure.

“Collaboration across the industry is necessary, and partnerships are something we will continue to explore as we grow,” Caylor said.",Colombia,2019.02
767,Increase in waste generated sees drop in Scotland’s recycling,"Scotland has reported a slight drop in its recycling rate to 58.9 per cent for 2017 as the total amount of waste generated increased by 5.5 per cent, according to official figures from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).

Official statistics for waste from all sources (WFAS) released on Wednesday (27 March) reveal that Scotland’s recycling rate fell from 59.1 per cent in 2016 (a revision of the originally reported 61 per cent figure), to 58.9 per cent in 2017. This was despite recycling 142,195 tonnes more waste than the previous year in real terms, sending a total of 6.93 million tonnes to be recycled.

The increase in recycling was offset by the fact that 620,000 tonnes of extra waste was generated in 2017, bringing the total amount of waste generated in Scotland that year to 11.82 million tonnes. Most of this increase can be attributed to construction and demolition (C&D) waste, which rose by 600,000 tonnes, representing an increase of 10.8 per cent.

The figures also show a significant increase in the amount of food waste being sent for composting or anaerobic digestion, rising by 16.6 per cent to 302,829 tonnes; improvements in organics recycling were a key part of the large nine per cent rise in Scotland’s WFAS recycling rate between 2015 and 2016. The amount of biodegradable municipal waste sent to landfill also fell once again, down from 1.14 million tonnes in 2016 to 1.09 million tonnes in 2017.

The overall quantity of waste being sent to landfill increased by 0.1 per cent in 2017 to 32.6 per cent of all waste – significant work remains to be done to achieve Scotland’s goal of a maximum five per cent of waste to landfill by 2025 – with the total amount of waste disposed of through both landfill and incineration increasing by 1.3 per cent to four million tonnes. A total of 761,581 tonnes of waste were sent for energy recovery in 2017, an increase of 14.7 per cent from 2016.

Scotland has made significant efforts in recent times to move away from a traditional linear economic model, which sees products thrown away at their end of life, towards a circular model that keeps materials in circulation for as long as possible. In 2016, the Scottish Government launched its circular economy strategy, ‘Making Things Last’, in collaboration with SEPA and Zero Waste Scotland, setting out a path towards more circular and sustainable use of resources. It has also made funding available to help businesses move to circular models and forged ahead with plans to introduce a deposit return scheme (DRS) for beverage containers in a bid to reduce plastic waste.

Commenting on the figures, Iain Gulland, Chief Executive at Zero Waste Scotland, said: “We are getting smarter about ways to deal with waste but the real challenge is in reducing it in the first place. More thought and planning needs to be given to circular economy approaches that enable products to be used time and again.



“Improvements can take place across the board. The implementation of the deposit return scheme is an example of one way where materials can be given a new life rather than simply being thrown away. To make an impact on waste, we need to take this approach to reusing our resources and make it common place.”

Terry A’Hearn, SEPA’s Chief Executive, added: “The scale of the environmental challenge is enormous and we know that in Scotland we currently use the resources of three planets, but only have one.

“The most successful countries in the 21st century will be resource efficient, circular economies, where what once was waste is valued as a resource. As such, the latest figures give communities and businesses a fresh focus for the opportunity ahead.”

Though Scotland’s WFAS recycling rate is very healthy, it remains in last place in the UK when it comes to its Waste from Households (WfH) recycling rate, with a recycling rate of 43.5 per cent. In the 2017 calendar year, Wales retained its place as the top recycling nation on that front, recycling 57.6 per cent of its WfH, while Northern Ireland overtook England, rising to 46.3 per cent. England increased its WfH recycling rate to 45.2 per cent in 2017, though figures for 2017/18 show that it fell to 44.8 per cent across that period.

890,Education is key on Global Recycling Day 2019,"The second annual Global Recycling Day is taking place today (18 March) across the world, aiming to promote the importance of recycled material, which organisers have termed ‘the seventh resource’ after water, air, oil, coal, minerals and natural gas.

Global Recycling Day was first recognised in 2018 and was set up by the Bureau for International Recycling (BIR), a trade association representing the recycling industry on the global stage. The BIR states that, through Global Recycling Day, it is seeking to ‘change the mindset of governments, businesses, communities and individuals around the world, to see recyclables as resource – not waste.’

This goal has never been more important than it is now, with a new report from the UN Environment Programme explaining that the world’s use of raw materials has more than tripled since 1970.

The ‘Global Resources Outlook 2019’ was put together by the International Resource Panel (IRP), a scientific body aiming to encourage a more sustainable use of natural resources. Published last week during this year’s UN Environment Assembly (11-15 March), the report examines trends in the consumption of natural resource, suggesting that by 2060, raw material usage could double to 190 billion tonnes.

This conclusion is in line with a 2018 report produced by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The OECD predicted that in the years until 2060, the recycling sector will grow faster than mining or minerals use, but that ‘the strong increase in demand for materials implies that both primary and secondary materials use increase at roughly the same speed’.

The impacts of this increased resource use are increasingly negative, the IRP report claims. If trends continue, by 2060, greenhouse gas emissions could increase by 43 per cent, while natural landscapes will degrade, with forests reducing by over 10 per cent and other habitats like grasslands by around 20 per cent. In addition, resource extraction and processing is currently responsible for 90 per cent of biodiversity loss and water stress (when demand for clean water exceeds the amount available). If this trend continues, it is stated, the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement will be ‘difficult to meet’.

Moving towards a circular economy, whereby resources are kept in use through recycling and reuse, is key to reducing the negative impacts of the extraction and processing of raw materials. For instance, the report shows that the climate change impacts of aluminium recycling are between 3.5 and 20 per cent of that of primary production.

‘What is needed is a move from linear to circular flows through a combination of extended product life cycles, intelligent product design and standardization and reuse, recycling and remanufacturing,’ the report states.

We live in worrying times, but the BIR’s goal may also be more achievable now than ever before, with governments and businesses showing themselves to be more willing to enact waste reduction and recycling policies – in no small part due to the changing demands of consumers and the growing public knowledge about the effects on the environment of a linear (take-make-dispose) consumption model.

This year’s Global Recycling Day is based around the theme ‘Recycling into the Future’, and focuses on ‘the power of youth, education and innovation’. The BIR has shared materials to be used in schools and youth clubs based around recycling, including recycling facts and tips on things to make out of recycling goods.

This approach can be highly effective, as a recent poll by the Midcounties Co-operative reveals. 2,000 people with children between five and 18 were questioned, and results show that four in 10 parents have been told off by their child for throwing away something recyclable, while half of children who go shopping with their parents provide tips such as to take a reusable bag. Parents largely credited schools with educating their children about waste and recycling.

The Midcounties Co-operative is launching its 1Change programme, which is working to educate people about single-use plastic – and is partnering with schools to take the message to young people. Mike Pickering, Co-operative social responsibility manager at said: “Reducing single-use plastic is a high priority for our 700,000 members, so we wanted to understand whether this desire was making its way to the next generation.

“Our results show, happily, that the mantle is also being passed down, with children showing real engagement in sustainable living – something we see regularly through our work with schools.”

131,Wales launches £6.5m fund to boost use of recycled materials,"The Welsh Government has announced £6.5 million of funding to drive Wales towards a circular economy.

Hannah Blythyn AM, previously Environment Minister and now Deputy Minister for Housing and Local Government with responsibility for waste and recycling, launched the Circular Economy Fund on 29 April during a visit to Klӧckner Pentaplast, a plastic packaging manufacturer based in Newport.

Grants of a minimum £25,000 and maximum £750,000 are on offer to any businesses looking to increase their use of recycled materials in manufacturing, with money going towards investment in the infrastructure and equipment needed to increase the use of recycled materials. The fund will be administered by WRAP Cymru, a circular economy organisation that provides support on behalf of the Welsh Government.

It is hoped that this investment will stimulate a domestic market for secondary recycled materials – the more recycled content used in packaging and products made in Wales, the more demand there will be for recycled material rather than raw materials.

At the launch, Blythyn praised Klӧckner Pentaplast, describing the company as “an example of how recycled material can be used to create a successful product, while benefiting our environment and stimulating demand for recycled material.”

Explaining the fund, she added: “[It] will help to cover some of the costs of investing in new equipment and infrastructure, increasing the use of recycled materials in Welsh manufacturing. We know this has the potential to bring significant cost savings as well as helping businesses to reduce their carbon footprint. Increased use of recycled material provides economic opportunities. It also helps create and protect jobs by making Welsh manufacturing companies more resource efficient and resilient in terms of the security of supply of raw materials.”

This funding adds to the ongoing investment by the Welsh Government into the circular economy in Wales as the country works towards its ambitious recycling target of 70 per cent by 2025, as set out in its ‘Towards Zero Waste’ strategy.

Much of this funding so far has gone to local authorities, with £7.5 million approved in February 2018, followed by a further £5.4 million to be shared across eight reuse and recycling projects, including the development of a new zero waste hub – or ‘Green Shed’ as the model is called – for Conwy and Denbighshire County Councils.

With a municipal waste (household and non-household waste) recycling rate of 62.7 per cent, as reported in the latest Local Authority Municipal Waste Management Statistics, Wales was well ahead of its 58 per cent recycling target for 2016/17. The Isle of Anglesey has hit its 2025 target early, reporting that 72.2 per cent of municipal waste was sent for reuse, recycling or composting in 2017/18.

If the entire country is to reach this level by 2025, it will be crucial for Welsh businesses to make the same progress that many local authorities have already begun.

“In Wales we recycle more than anywhere else in the UK and we are within touching distance of being the world’s top recycling nation. I want us to go even further towards a truly circular economy,” Blythyn said.

475,Fashion retailers to explore circular business models,"The London Waste and Recycling Board (LWARB) and circular economy consultants QSA Partners have announced that they are working with a number of fashion retailers to develop and pilot new circular economy business models, aiming to promote clothes hire, product resale, repair and rental services.

Announced yesterday (30 May), the organisations will be working with retailers including Farfetch, Ted Baker and new brand FW through the Circular Fashion Fast Forward project, with each retailer exploring and developing their own approach to becoming a more circular business. The project will be funded by the C&A Foundation, a corporate organisation supporting the transition to a circular economy for fashion.

“The fashion industry needs to rapidly adopt new business models that increase the use of clothing and stop the use of unsustainable materials,” says Megan McGill, Programme Manager for the C&A Foundation. “This is a critical step towards a circular fashion sector. The Circular Fashion Fast Forward project and the participating brands will demonstrate what can already be done today and inspire more industry players to follow.”

The fashion industry is a significant part of the UK economy, contributing £28.1 billion to national GDP in 2015. It also produces a large amount of waste, with consumers throwing away one million tonnes of textiles every year, 300,000 tonnes of which ends up in the household waste stream.

The high turnover of clothing is largely attributed to ‘fast fashion’, which sees retailers sell cheap clothing with short lifespans, encouraging consumers to purchase new items rather than make existing ones last. The Circular Fashion Fast Forward Project aims to move retailers away from this approach, creating case studies that will be shared once the project is completed to help other fashion retailers to adopt their own circular business models.

With awareness of the environmental impact of the fashion industry on the rise – Parliament’s Environmental Audit Committee launched an inquiry into the sustainability of the industry in June last year, and called for a one pence producer responsibility fee to be paid by fashion brands and retailers on each item of clothing they sell to fund better textile collection – businesses are opening their eyes to the opportunities afforded to them by going circular.

Resale is an increasingly fertile market for businesses, with a recent report by online thrift store thredUP putting the global value of the second-hand market at $24 billion (£19 billion), a figure that is expected to double in the next five years. Furthermore, a Business of Fashion report, ‘The state of fashion 2019’, highlights that resale is growing nine times faster than traditional retail, while the Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates that an industry-wide move towards circular fashion could add €160 billion (£141.3 billion) in value to the global economy by 2030.

Resale and extending the life of products are certainly key motivations for the participating retailers, with Thomas Berry, Director of Sustainable Business at Farfetch, saying: “Circular models like resale or rental are big commercial opportunities for Farfetch. They are a very natural extension of our long-standing vintage offer, and we have started to pilot a few new models. Since 2018 our Browns retail store has been in partnership with rental platform Armarium, and we have just launched Farfetch Secondlife, a handbag resale service for our customers. We are excited to be working with LWARB and QSA to build the business case to accelerate our work in this area.”

Anna Smoothy, Senior Marketing Manager at new outerwear brand FW, added: “FW’s approach to sustainability is an open-ended conversation. We are constantly searching to refine our materials and reduce our impact. At FW, quality is sustainability. We make products to last while incorporating eco-materials that are proven to be durable like Oxford Recycled Yarn. We are not just making eco-friendly products destined for landfill – we would like to underline the fact that we are developing a Repair Program with QSA and LWARB so that our fans invest in FW for life.”",Colombia,2019.05
591,A new zero waste hierarchy for the circular economy,"Circular economy network Zero Waste Europe (ZWE) has developed a new waste management hierarchy that it says puts the focus on resources instead of waste.

The traditional waste hierarchy is a tool that lists methods of waste management in order of their impact on the environment in a simple diagram. The current waste hierarchy was introduced in the 2008 EU Waste Framework Directive, which sets out the basic definitions of concepts and principles involved in waste management, listing prevention at the top (most preferable) to reuse, recycling, recovery and then disposal at the bottom (least preferable).

However, ZWE is calling for an updated model that would ‘change the mindset from waste management to resource management.’ The organisation states: ‘The driving force of the hierarchy should be not only the safe disposal of our waste but also to ensure that the value of our resources is preserved in the economy for the new generations.’

The new model proposed by ZWE focuses more strongly on keeping resources in use for as long as possible. Therefore, the top two levels focus on ‘products’ not waste, expanding the ‘prevention’ level of the traditional hierarchy out into ‘Refuse, rethink, redesign’. This encapsulates anything that stops waste from being produced, from behaviour change to prevent consumption of single-use items, to rethinking business models to make them waste free by design. This, ZWE says, should be the central priority of economic and environmental EU policies and funding.

The second level, ‘Reduce and reuse’, focuses on keeping used products in use and preventing them from becoming waste, while the third level, ‘Preparation for reuse’, refers to taking waste products and refurbishing them so that they can become usable again. Level four mirrors the traditional hierarchy, with recycling, composting and anaerobic digestion the ideal ‘last option’ for keeping materials in use.

At level five, ZWE prioritises ‘Material and chemical recovery’ over simple energy recovery – this places more of a focus on retaining materials and resources, rather than converting valuable material into energy through, say, incineration.

Finally, at the bottom of ZWE’s hierarchy are disposal options, with residuals management the last option for the waste that is left over after all valuable materials have been reclaimed.

Last year, EU member states signed off on the Circular Economy Package (CEP), a suite of new laws designed to make a more resource efficient Europe. Not only does the CEP set new recycling targets for member states – 65 per cent municipal waste recycling by 2035 – it turns the EU’s focus firmly towards a circular approach, seeing waste first and foremost as a resource. The text of the CEP states that members should be looking to move up the waste hierarchy, noting that ‘waste prevention is the most efficient way to improve resource efficiency and to reduce the environmental impact of waste.’

However, Joan Marc Simon, ZWE’s Executive Director, commented: “The EU knows how to manage waste, but not how to manage resources. The newly elected Commission and Parliament should propose a whole new set of legislation with the legal and economic incentives for products and packaging to be designed not to generate waste in the first place.”

Simon continued: “We need new tools for the new times, and the Zero Waste hierarchy we propose is a tool that sets the right priorities to achieve Europe’s circular economy goals.”",Colombia,2019.05
901,MPs launch inquiry into e-waste and the circular economy,"Parliament’s Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) has launched an inquiry into the circular economy and electronic waste (e-waste).

Announced today (27 June), the EAC, which considers the extent to which government policies and those of public bodies contribute to environmental protection and sustainability, will investigate the environmental and human health impacts of the disposal of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) and what is being done to move towards a circular economy for electronic goods.

The growth in the use and sale of personal electronic devices such as mobile phones, tablets and laptops has led to a dramatic increase in the amount of e-waste generated globally, with 44.7 million tonnes of waste being produced around the world in 2017, 90 per cent of which was sent to landfill, incinerated, illegally traded or treated in a sub-standard way. Half of the e-waste produced globally comes from Europe and the US, with the EU predicted to produce 12 million tonnes by 2020.

E-waste can contain up to 60 different metals and chemicals, which, if disposed of incorrectly, can be hazardous to the environment and human health through contamination of the soil, pollution of water sources and exposing people to toxic substances.

Though exporting e-waste to developing countries is banned, 1.3 million tonnes of undocumented e-waste is estimated to be exported from the EU every year, with the UK ranked as the worst offender in the EU by the Basel Action Network in February this year.

The global dumping of e-waste has led to countries taking action, with Nigeria investing £1.53 million in WEEE recycling to deal with the 1.1 million tonnes of e-waste it receives every year, while Thailand banned the import of e-waste last year in response to fears it was becoming a ‘dumping ground’ for the world’s e-waste.

Furthermore, the improper disposal and lack of recycling of e-waste also is seeing significant resources leaking out of the economy; global e-waste is estimated to be worth $62.5 billion (£49.3 billion), due to the intrinsic value of the materials used in electronic devices, such as rare earth elements (REEs).

On a domestic scale, the UK produces 24.9 kilogrammes (kg) of e-waste per person, higher than the EU average of 17.7kg. E-waste in the UK is managed under the EU’s WEEE Directive and WEEE Regulations 2013.

As part of those regulations, a producer responsibility scheme is in place, which holds producers financially responsible for the end-of-life management of their products, with annual targets for WEEE collection set by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).

These targets are calculated based on the WEEE Directive’s target of 65 per cent of the average annual weight of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) placed on the market over the previous three years. The target for 2019 has been set at 550,577 tonnes, a 12 per cent increase on 2018 levels. The UK missed its WEEE collection target of 537,065 tonnes by 44,500 tonnes in 2018. Where collection falls short of the target, a compliance fee is paid by producers according to market share, which is then put towards projects to increase WEEE recycling and reuse. The total fund for 2017 stood at £8 million.

Commenting on the launch of the inquiry, Chair of the EAC, Mary Creagh MP, said: “Our old fridges, freezers, computers, TVs, kettles and mobile phones are piling up in a ‘tsunami of e-waste’. New phone launches, cheaper goods, and built-in obsolescence have contributed to the growth of electronic waste in recent years.

“The UK produces more e-waste than the EU average. We are missing EU targets and are one of the worst offenders for exporting waste to developing countries, who are ill equipped to dispose of it in a socially and environmentally responsible way.

“Our attitude to e-waste is unsustainable and the need for radical action clear. We will be investigating the UK’s e-waste industry and looking at how we can create a circular economy for electronic goods.”

The EAC’s inquiry will be seeking answers to the following questions:
• What steps are being taken to move towards a circular economy for electronic goods? How can the UK Government support this transition?
• What is the environmental and human health risk from e-waste? How significant is it and who is most at risk?
• How can secondary markets for electrical goods be improved? What incentives are required to implement these markets?
• Why does recovering materials from electronic waste pose a significant challenge? What support is required to facilitate the adoption of recovery technologies?
• Are UK WEEE collection targets achievable? What challenges do UK producer compliance schemes and WEEE reprocessors face in meeting the collection targets?
• What causes fraud in the UK’s e-waste system? How can this be addressed?
• What action can the UK Government take to prevent the illegal export of e-waste to the developing world?
• What proposals does the UK Government need to consider as part of its consultation on WEEE?
• Is UK public awareness of e-waste recycling satisfactory? If not, how can it be improved?

If you would like to contribute to the inquiry, written evidence should be submitted through the inquiry page by 5pm on Friday 16 August.",Colombia,2019.06
159,French law says companies can’t destroy unsold stock,"The French Government is set to ban the destruction of unsold non-food goods as part of new legislation on the circular economy, though concerns have been raised that it does not go far enough.

The new measure, announced by Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on 4 June, would mean that unsold consumer goods such as clothes, electronics and furniture would have to be sent for recycling or reuse by companies.

The plan is part of the Circular Economy Bill, set to be discussed by the government in July. Other proposals in the bill include an obligation for online marketplaces to ensure that the collection and recycling of the products they market on their sites are properly financed and to implement extended producer responsibility (EPR) regimes for items such as sports and DIY equipment and cigarette filters.

According to Philippe’s office, some €650 million (£576 million) worth of consumer goods are thrown away or destroyed every year in France, a practice Philippe said was tantamount to “a scandal”.

The law anticipates special arrangements for the luxury sector, where items are often destroyed to maintain an element of exclusivity for a brand – last year British fashion brand Burberry admitted to burning unsold clothing and accessories worth £28.6 million every year to avoid them going to market for a cut price – while items that must be used by a certain date will also have special arrangements.

However, despite the waste reduction proposal being described as a “world first” by Philippe, not all groups in France have welcomed the move wholeheartedly. Paris-based NGO Zero Waste France stated that authorising unsold items to be sent for recycling “more or less amounts to destroying them and not reusing them”.

The group states that it would be better for the law to clearly obligate the reuse of these items, a move that would be more in line with the circular economy ethos. This would be more in tune with the law introduced in 2016 that requires supermarkets over 400 square metres in size to sign agreements with one or more organisations to redistribute unused food.

Zero Waste France has also criticised the lack of targets for reducing single-use plastic and the lack of new bans for certain single-use plastic items in the Circular Economy Bill, despite the EU’s Single-Use Plastic Directive, which was voted through by the European Parliament on 27 March, providing for the banning of more single-use plastic items such as plastic cutlery and food containers.",Colombia,2019.06

367,Zero Waste Scotland to fund plastic reduction projects,"Zero Waste Scotland has released £500,000 of funding for projects that aim to tackle the blight of single-use plastic items in Scotland.

The new initiative, called ‘Action on Plastics’, will use funding from the European Regional Development Fund to support community groups and potential contractors that want to address the issue of disposable plastic items through reduction projects.

The £500,000 of funding will go to those projects that propose innovative measures to eradicate disposable plastics and other materials from event and community spaces, as well as within businesses. The first projects will run as pilots and aim to develop replicable approaches to minimizing waste that can be implemented across Scotland.

Items that the project hopes to target as a priority include bottles, cups, straws, stirrers, food containers, condiment sachets, cable ties and event goody bags.

Commenting on the initiative, Iain Gulland, Chief Executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “Since Blue Planet we have seen an overwhelming desire to tackle single use plastics which is fantastic to see, but there is still a lot of confusion about what is a sustainable alternative. One example of this is the widespread move to using paper straws instead of plastic ones. It’s better for marine litter, but paper straws are often not recycled and will produce methane in landfill, which contributes to the climate emergency.

“We want to establish a clear hierarchy to show it’s best to get rid of disposable items altogether, use reusable items wherever possible, and maximise the recycling of any remaining single-use items, but we have to properly test these approaches in real life situations first. These ground-breaking projects will do that.”

‘Action on Plastics’ is part of Zero Waste Scotland’s £73-million Resource Efficient Circular Economy Accelerator Programme, which aims to boost the circular economy and promote circular business practices and manufacturing across the country.

The Scottish Government has actively promoted the circular economy and resource efficiency, making it a key pillar of its environmental and industrial strategies. In 2016, the Scottish Government launched its circular economy strategy, ‘Making Things Last’, in collaboration with SEPA and Zero Waste Scotland, setting out a path towards a more circular and sustainable use of resources.

Moving to a circular economy approach could deliver significant economic benefits to Scottish communities, according to reports carried out by Zero Waste Scotland, with the adoption of circular business practices potentially worth £1 billion to the regions of Tayside and Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire alone.

Scotland has also sought to put itself on the front foot in the fight against single-use plastics, pushing ahead with plans to introduce a deposit return scheme (DRS) for drinks containers as a means to tackle single-use plastic waste by increasing capture rates of the millions of plastic bottles that go unrecycled.

Organisations interested in tendering to provide the expertise behind the ‘Actions on Plastics’ scheme can submit a tender through Public Contracts Scotland. Zero Waste Scotland has already been in contact directly with several community groups and would like to hear from any others that wish to take part in trials.

If an organisation does not wish to bid to be a contractor, but would like to receive support from a contractor to deliver action on single use items in your community, they should email [email protected] by 1 August to request their contact details to be shared with bidders, so they can be contacted to discuss s",Colombia,2019.07
205,Australia urged to move towards a circular economy on recycling,"Australia should take its cue from the circular economy on recycling, reusing its waste rather than sending it to landfill, says a recent report by business advisory firm EY. It added that Australians need to have confidence in their country’s recycling system and should look upon it as a resource rather than waste.

The accounting firm affirmed a combined approach to waste which included households, local councils and the private sector is needed to “restore faith” in the country’s recycling system. This would lead to the start of a win-win circular economy.

Such an economy can be achieved when “people minimize waste and make the most of resources. Shifting to a more circular economy will grow the economy, increase jobs and reduce impacts on the environment,” according to the Victorian State Government.

Australia’s strategy of dealing with its waste by sending it to China for processing was thrown into confusion in 2017. It was then when China decided to tighten the restrictions on contamination for accepting foreign waste. The new standards effectively banned all Australian paper, plastics and textiles because of their high contamination rate.

Before the Chinese ban, it had been sending 619,000 tonnes of recycling waste to China every year.

Terence L. Jeyaretnam, an environmental and sustainability expert who is also a partner at EY in Melbourne, described the present methods as an example of a “lost opportunity”.

“Through better sorting of recyclables, reducing contamination and developing markets for our recycled waste, Australia could take advantage of this lost opportunity sitting in our kerbside bins,” he said.

He added that Australians were missing out on up to $324 million of value in our waste bins and needed to change to adapt to the future.

“The old way of sorting our waste is not the right fit for 21st century Australia,” he said in the study, adding that “not only does it lead to poor environmental outcomes, it’s preventing us from grasping an opportunity worth hundreds of millions per year.”

The report underlined the need for Australia to view waste as a valuable resource saying it “will only be realized if households take a more diligent approach to sorting, councils assist though education and infrastructure and there is a greater focus on waste as a resource.”

It points to a lack of confidence currently amongst households with the country’s recycling methods.

“Instead of ‘waste’ we need consumers to see a tradable asset, a commodity with a market value. The first step in changing consumers behavior is restoring their belief that what they are putting in the recycling bin is actually being recycled,” said the discussion paper.

Restoring the customer’s faith in the broken recycling system would be the first step towards creating a viable circular economy and finding a solution to the recycling crisis in Australia, summarized the report.",Colombia,2019.09
342,Scottish Government to table Circular Economy Bill,"Scotland’s 2019/20 Programme for Government was published yesterday (3 September) setting out plans to tackle climate change and drive progress towards net zero carbon emissions by 2045.

The programme outlined Scotland’s plans for a new Circular Economy Bill, which aims to change attitudes towards waste and tackle the country’s throw-away culture. The new bill will include provisions to introduce charges on items such as single-use coffee cups – tackling the 4,000 tonnes of waste beverage cups create in Scotland each year – and a new penalty for littering from vehicles.

Consultations on the new bill will begin shortly, with the aim that the legislation will be brought forward in the coming year.

Launching the Programme for Government, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “Earlier this year, I acknowledged that Scotland – like the rest of the world – faces a climate emergency. We are now committed to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045 at the latest – earlier than any other UK nation.

“This year’s Programme for Government is an important part of our response to the climate emergency, containing measures which will reduce emissions while supporting sustainable and inclusive growth.”

Commenting on the Circular Economy Bill, Sturgeon added: “Scotland has the opportunity to become a world leader in this essential industry of the future – we must grasp that opportunity.

“We will also continue our efforts to reduce waste, and to reuse and recycle materials more effectively. To encourage this further, we will introduce a Circular Economy Bill in the coming year. Among other things, it will enable changes to be applied for items such as single-use coffee cups.”

The programme places Scotland’s plans for its deposit return scheme (DRS), set to be introduced in 2021, at the heart of its efforts to reduce waste. The DRS aims to increase recycling rates through placing a 20 pence fee on top of the cost of drinks containers, which can then be recouped when the container is returned for recycling.

Although Scotland’s upcoming DRS has been met with a mixed response from the waste industry, with critics suggesting that the scheme will negatively impact kerbside collections, the Scottish Government claim that the DRS will reduce the £46 million spent each year on litter removal and will achieve carbon savings equivalent to taking 85,000 cars off the roads.

Taking further action to cut down on single-use plastics, the Scottish Government also announced that it will shortly consult on raising the minimum amount for the single-use carrier bag charge from five pence to 10 pence, in line with the standards set out in the European Union’s Single Use Plastic Directive.

Despite efforts to target waste reduction, Scotland’s recycling rate fell from 59.1 per cent in 2016 to 58.9 per cent in 2017, due to an extra 620,000 tonnes of waste – mostly from construction and demolition (C&D) – being generated in 2017.

Scotland did, however, see a significant increase in the amount of food waste being sent for composting or anaerobic digestion, which rose by 16.6 per cent to 302,829 tonnes in 2017 – the Scottish Government states that 80 per cent of households now have access to food waste collections.

In order to build on the progress made in food waste recycling, the programme commits to exploring opportunities to require businesses to publicly report food waste and surplus, with a consultation to be carried out on obligating food retail sites to redistribute unsold edible food products. Further, the Scottish Government will also consult on the existing rural exemption for household food waste collections and review the food waste separation requirements.

Regards to dry recycling, the Scottish Government’s programme commits to begin an evaluation of the Scottish Household Recycling Charter and review the Charter’s Code of Practice, both of which govern how local authority kerbside recycling is carried out in Scotland.

The programme also outlined the government’s plans for a ‘Green New Deal’, which will accelerate investment in projects to achieve the net zero goal. Highlighting the value of bioenergy in decarbonising our energy system, the programme laid out plans to consult on a draft bioenergy action plan later this year.

The Scottish Government also plans to develop the industrial biotechnology sector, which is working to replace existing fuels with sustainable, non-fossil based alternatives.

Scotland has been at the forefront of the move towards a circular economy, publishing its circular economy strategy, ‘Making Things Last’, in 2016, which set out the government’s plans to use resources more efficiently. As part of this strategy, the government set a target to limit the amount of waste going to landfill to five per cent by 2025.

Shortly before the publication of the circular economy strategy, Sturgeon announced a £70 million investment programme to help small to medium-sized enterprises (SME) implement circular business models. The government has also set up four ‘Circular Regions’ – Glasgow, Edinburgh, Tayside and the North East – which each receive tailored support to promote local circular opportunities.

In October 2018, Zero Waste Scotland released a report revealing the value of the circular economy for Scotland, with figures suggesting that the benefits of adopting circular business practices could be worth £1 billion in the regions of Tayside, Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.

450,Brexit Is Overshadowing Climate Activism | The Rising,"Due to the ongoing Brexit crisis in the United Kingdom, discussions regarding climate change legislation has been postponed. The European Union meets four times a year in Brussels, Belgium, and this past week the British Parliament asked for yet another extension on formulating a plan to decarbonize by 2050.

In November 2018, the EU proposed to have its total carbon emissions reach a net-zero by 2050. This was a move unique to the EU, and it sought to motivate other countries such as the US and Brazil to follow its footsteps. Over half the members of the EU, including the UK, have signed onto this plan.

Critics have deemed this plan as ambitious and near impossible. Moreover, there is a lot of pressure on European governments from large industries. Still, there is hope for the EU to reach this goal as many of the members are adamant about decarbonizing all of Europe. The biggest obstacle to this plan, however, is the countries’ internal affairs. The prime example of this is the UK’s notorious Brexit plan.

In June 2016, a referendum on whether to leave the European Union was held in the UK. Then, 51.6% of people voted to leave. Ever since, deals illustrating better ways for the UK to leave the EU have been proposed. Both the EU and the UK have shared and torn apart these deals. Today, the disagreements persist with a very obscure future.

It is partly because of this ongoing issue that the EU was unable to present a proper plan for decarbonization at the UN climate summit last month. The aforementioned meeting in Brussels also illustrated that the UK won’t adopt the decarbonization plan. Many EU officials have expressed annoyance towards the UK for this reason. Climate activist Greta Thunberg further argued that if politicians and governments were serious about tackling climate change, they would not spend their time “talking about taxes and Brexit.”

The adoption of the 2050 plan from the UK is being pushed to take place in 2020. The EU has little interest in refusing the UK of an extension, too. This is because a chaotic no-deal scenario would be initiated by the EU, which would be less than advantageous.

Internal issues such as Brexit have been an obstacle to the EU’s proposed climate action for years, now. It is essential for Great Britain to pull itself out of the ongoing issue to create a plan for the future.

Will The UK Set Aside Politics To Focus On Climate Change?

Many activists wish to see countries such as the UK set aside their politics to focus on more important issues like climate change. It is unclear how long it will take for the UK and the EU to finally reach an agreement about Brexit, but there is hope that this extension will be the last one.",Colombia,2019.10
609,An interview with Lucy & Yak,"A fresh wave of climate strikes on Friday 20th September saw an insurgence of people power across the globe, demanding urgent action towards the spiralling ecological problem.

With the hashtag #weekforfuture confirming it as one of the biggest global demonstrations in history, the need for sustainable and ethical resourcing amongst brands and emerging companies has never been more important.

Lucy & Yak is an independent clothing company that prides itself on this very idea, stating on their website that “The system is whatever we all decide to make it, so let’s make a system where everyone wins”. With their Brighton store opening on Gloucester Road in April, the brand’s reputation has continued to grow, developing a name as a standout sustainable fashion brand nestled amongst Brighton. I spoke to Tasha from Lucy & Yak to get to know a little more about the inspiration behind the brand and the popularity of ethically sourced fashion and clothing in today’s climate.

Can you tell us a little bit about the brand?

Lucy and Yak has grown from having no investment and very little money to employing 40 staff in the UK, all paid a minimum of £9ph as per livingwage.org. The majority of which are in Barnsley, an area that has suffered since the closure of coal mines in the 80’s.

We have a very unique business structure; working with Ismail as more of a business partner rather than a standard factory relationship means we can have full transparency with our supply chain. Ismail’s factory has grown to employ 70 people earning 3 to 4 times the state minimum wage.We personally visit all suppliers twice a year, meeting staff and owners and checking working conditions and pay. Other than Ismail they are all Sedex certified.

In addition, Lucy and Yak are working to reduce our already low environmental impact by working with organic and recycled materials in over 95% of our range. We choose organic cotton because it has lower water consumption and uses no harmful chemicals. Moreover, recycled materials help promote a circular economy. Our main factory that we built with Ismail is solar powered, so the majority of our range is produced using renewable energy. We use as little plastic as possible, packing 5 to 10 pieces in 1 piece of plastic in India and posting out to customers in recycled Indian Sari bags and bio-degradable mailing bags.

Our product is unique and we create a community atmosphere. We are proof that capitalism can be kind and successful. We are the new business model.

Where did the inspiration behind Lucy and Yak originally come from? How was Lucy and Yak born?

Lucy and Yak was born out of a love for travelling and not wanting to work for someone else. We initially wanted to make a few pairs of dungarees and sell them so we could keep travelling. Having set up on Depop selling vintage clothing we had already created a customer base who has loved the product ever since.

What was it about Brighton that drew you to expanding the company here?

We were drawn to Brighton for many reasons. We love the laid back and open-minded atmosphere, which is great for building a team of creatives in our design studio. We like that it’s the only place in the country that votes green and it is a city that still has the small town community feel.

In the wake of the recent Global Climate Strikes, do you think there has been a shift in people’s attitudes towards sustainable fashion since the company started?

It’s hard to say as we sometimes think we live in a bubble of people who care about these issues. It can be hard to tell if there is a shift in anything or if it’s just the people we surround ourselves with. People in Brighton seem to care already but is this the same elsewhere?

Out of your new range of Lucy & Yak products, what top three products would you say are staples for this Autumn/Winter?

Always the Originals as who doesn’t want a comfy pair of organic corduroy dungarees this time of year? We have just launched our Stevie and Blake fleeces made from recycled plastic bottles which very cosy and warm. Lastly, I would say something from our Made in Yorkshire range that is soon to come!

Term has begun! For all the students out there – is there a must have ‘Back to School’ item in at the moment?

Our organic cotton Dylan backpack is a great back to school item. It has been a huge hit and makes a great Christmas present!

Do you have any upcoming in-store events soon?

We have a meditation mindfulness evening coming in October that we are really excited about. This is something important to myself and Chris and we couldn’t have done all this without it.

Where do you see Lucy & Yak heading in the future?

In the UK we are working towards bringing manufacturing back to Yorkshire by opening our own sewing room. We are hoping this will grow to start our own factory here in Barnsley. Garment manufacturing is already present in the UK but often has poor wages and working conditions. We encourage fair working conditions for everyone that makes our clothes and are always looking at ways to improve the production. This is something close to our hearts as my parents always talk about how the closing of the factories and coal mines affected the community negatively. We would love to offer jobs to the skilled workers in the area.",Colombia,2019.10
950,Adidas Sustainability Initiatives: Creating A More Circular Economy | The Rising,"According to The Robin Report, around 65 – 75 percent of consumers under the age of 35 say that they want brands to be more sustainable; Adidas sustainability initiatives aim to do just that. Naturally, news of climate change and dangers to the environment have made major impacts on the economic arena. And consequently, increasing demand for sustainable products fosters healthy competition among companies. From sustainable fashion to sustainable foods, Adidas sustainability initiatives have shown the company’s deliberate strides towards creating a more circular economy.

In 2017, Adidas and Parley For The Oceans teamed up to tackle the plastic pollution in oceans. Their cooperation created the Adidas Parley shoes. These are sports shoes made out of plastic trash found in ocean.

In that same year, Adidas managed to sell one million shoes made out of ocean plastic. And the number of shoes sold is rising. It is not just shoes, either — consumers can purchase shirts, dresses, and pants now too. All of it is recycled from ocean plastic.

Additional to the push for recycled shoes, Adidas sustainability initiatives hope to help the company shift to totally recycled polyester by 2024. Furthermore, the company promises to keep its quality with recycled polyester.

Additionally, the Futurecraft Loop is a shoe that is 100% recyclable. Adidas will sell the new iteration of these shoes in 2021. It is clear that both Adidas and Parley For The Oceans are dedicated to making the ocean a cleaner place.

The founder of Parley has spoken out against plastic pollution, “Plastic is a design failure, just alien matter that shouldn’t be on this planet.”

Just a few weeks ago, Adidas sustainability initiatives took one additional stride by launching a voucher system in the UK. Specifically, the system allows consumers to give back their worn-out shoes.

In return, customers would earn up to $25 in credit toward a future purchase.

Afterwards, Adidas would resell or recycle those worn-out shoes. This develops an intrinsic value in the shoes that people own. Additionally, it teaches consumers to shop more wisely.

Five days ago, the company announced its partnership with International Space Station (ISS) U.S. National Laboratory. This multi-year partnership will pursue innovations in both technology and sustainability.

Moreover, this partnership will mark the first time that footwear innovation will be tested in space.

Among many other efforts to communicate sustainability with its consumers, Adidas hosted its annual Run for the Oceans. During the race, which occurs on World Oceans Day on June 8th, had runners log the distance they run in one week.

For every kilometer run, Adidas donated $1 to Parley Education School. These donations aided in educating young people on how to tackle the marine problem. Not surprisingly, Adidas surpassed its goal of $1.5 million.

As consumers become more environmentally aware, so must the companies that provide for them. Adidas and Parley for the Oceans are setting an important precedent for other companies that wish to continue competing in the economic arena.

With companies like Coca-Cola adding to plastic pollution, companies have to make a change if they want continual profits.

Consequently, sustainable products are imperative if companies wish to flourish in a world driven by environmental justice. But Adidas sustainability initiatives are just the first step of many.",Colombia,2019.11
983,Scottish Government reveals proposals for Circular Economy Bill,"The Scottish Government has revealed measures for its upcoming Circular Economy Bill, which will now be subject to a public consultation.

Plans to introduce a Circular Economy Bill were revealed in the Scottish Government’s 2019/20 Programme for Government in September, with proposals designed to tackle climate change and drive progress towards net zero carbon emissions by 2045.

Measures proposed in the Bill include giving ministers the power to place charges on disposable items that are deemed harmful to the environment. The Scottish Government has already announced its intention to apply this charge to single-use drinks cups, with the final level of the charge likely to be between 20 and 25 pence per cup.

Other measures include: increasing the minimum single-use carrier bag charge from five pence to 10 pence; introducing the mandatory reporting of surplus stock of certain materials and encouraging its reuse, with food waste and textiles deemed priority areas; moving the voluntary Household Recycling Charter towards a mandated approach to increase recycling; and introducing powers for enforcement authorities to seize vehicles involved in waste crime and issue fixed penalty notices for littering from vehicles.

Public bodies will also be required to set out how they will meet climate change and circular economy obligations in their procurement strategies, in the hope that taking a more circular approach to procurement will stimulate increased demand for remanufactured and refurbished goods.

The Scottish Government has launched a consultation to gather public feedback on these proposals for legislation to develop Scotland’s circular economy.

The six-week consultation will be open for responses until 19 December so that the initiatives can be transposed into Scottish law before July 2020.

Commenting on the consultation, Scottish Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: “A thriving circular economy presents enormous economic and industrial opportunities for Scotland, as well as significant environmental benefits. An estimated 80 per cent of our global climate emissions are currently linked to the production, consumption and waste of products and resources.

“For our journey towards becoming a net-zero society to be successful, it must involve a fundamental re-think about how we use and reuse materials. An innovative circular economy can improve productivity and open up new markets while providing employment opportunities and lower cost options to access the goods we need.

“Responding to the global climate emergency will be a challenge for us all – be it government, business or individuals – and I would strongly encourage everyone to share their views on how we make this journey together.”

Measures put forward in the Circular Economy Bill will complement the aims and objectives of existing legislation and policies that the Scottish Government hopes will advance the circular economy in Scotland, including that regarding Scotland’s deposit return scheme (DRS), billed to be introduced in 2021, and its Food Waste Reduction Action Plan, which aims to reduce Scotland’s food waste by one third by 2025.

Though the proposed Circular Economy Bill covers a number of areas to help drive towards the country’s recycling targets, the Bill has already come in for criticism for its scope, with Allan Sandilands, Principal Consultant at Resource Futures, decrying the lack of proposals aimed at the construction sector.

He said: “It is encouraging to see the Scottish Government take further steps towards helping Scotland transition to a circular economy through this bill. But it is disappointing to see no mention of the construction sector.

“It’s like the elephant in the room. Buildings account for 39 per cent of energy-related carbon emissions globally: 28 per cent from operational emissions and 11 per cent from materials and construction. As we progress towards a net-zero future, urgent action is required from the built environment to address embodied carbon and reduce whole-life carbon emissions of new buildings.



“The circular economy should be a mechanism for tackling this carbon impact and the Scottish Government need to signal an intent to the construction industry that they are serious about the 11 per cent embodied carbon by mandating reductions in waste and material consumption.”

Meanwhile, Stephen Freeland, Policy Advisor for the Scottish Environmental Services Association (SESA), lamented the lack of proposals regarding residual waste treatment, saying: ""Key to the success of Scotland’s circular economy ambitions is the development of sustainable end markets, which help stimulate demand for recycled material. Changes to the public procurement process is a welcome first step, but much more could be done to help create resilient markets for recyclates, and a strong domestic reprocessing and manufacturing sector. Disappointingly, the proposals are completely silent on options for treating residual waste within the circular economy. To manage Scotland’s waste effectively all levels of the waste hierarchy should be addressed, and that includes prioritising energy from waste for society’s non-recyclable, combustible waste which in turn provides a source of low carbon energy to help power the re-manufacturing activities further up the hierarchy.""

The full consultation paper for the Circular Economy Bill is available to read on the Scottish Government’s website and will be open for responses until 19 December 2019.",Colombia,2019.11
