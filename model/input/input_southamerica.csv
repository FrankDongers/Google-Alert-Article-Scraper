42,Start-ups redefining sustainability on the shortlist for circular award,"The Green Alley Award, presented by Landbell Group, is awarded to start-ups whose business ideas help advance the circular economy with new and original concepts. Created in 2014, the annual award ceremony has just released a shortlist for enterprise nominations.

Based in Mainz, Germany, the Landbell Group set up the first award in 2014 to highlight innovative start-ups working in the fields of digital circular economy, recycling schemes or waste prevention. Compliance scheme provider European Recycling Platform (ERP) UK, a Landbell Group subsidiary company, is sponsoring the event this year.

Narrowed down from 215 applicants in 30 European countries to just six, the finalists for 2018 offer a wide range of ideas for developing new sustainable materials, preventing waste or utilising digital devices to help create a circular economy.

“Each of our finalists has developed a clever, unique concept based on the idea of the circular economy,” said Jan Patrick Schulz, CEO of Landbell Group. “We are very pleased that the award has been so well received and that start-ups are strong and important drivers in such an innovation-driven sector as the circular economy.”

German company Superseven uses the Repaq brand to develop completely biodegradable packaging that can compete with plastic packaging. It has created foil packaging made of cellulose which is compostable and TUV-certified. The packaging also contains no pollutants, is suitable for food packaging and will not harm the environment, humans or animals.

A start-up from Austria, Refurbed revives used electrical and electronic equipment such as smartphones, tablets, monitors and even household appliances. Experts make the equipment new and improved, recycling the appliances whole instead of in parts, which costs consumers up to 40 per cent less.

Aiming for a world without wrappers, Minimum Waste (MIWA), from the Czech Republic, is a start-up with newly developed technology that enables food retailers and consumers to buy and sell produce without the packaging. Traders receive products from producers in containers from which consumers will then take the exact amount needed. The containers, once emptied, can be cleaned and returned to the producer to be used again.

This Italian company uses their solution ‘EcoAllene’ to overcome the difficulty of separating material mixes, such as waste products like sweet wrappers, which consist of a metal and a plastic layer. This patented production process creates a versatile new ecological plastic material which can be used in clothing, paving stones or household items.

‘Circular IQ’ is an application which collects and aggregates data across the entire supply chain, from materials sources to supplier contracts. Companies can monitor the sustainability of their products and create transparency for customers and buyers. This solution from the Netherlands attempts to provide the answers to sustainable purchasing questions for a wide range of producers.

This UK-based start-up is ‘re-thinking waste feathers’ and has developed an environmentally friendly and sustainable product to be used as insulation for packaging. The product, pluumo, uses excess feathers from the down industry that would otherwise be disposed of; these are stuffed inside certified biodegradable protective covers, also made from recycled materials.

Finalists will work on their business models in private talks with specialists from Landbell Group. After providing a live pitch in front of the jury, the winner will be announced at the award ceremony on 18 October in Berlin, and the winning start-up will receive a prize of €25,000 (around £22,360).

Sulapac, a Finnish start-up, took home the top prize in last year’s Green Alley Awards for its new alternative packaging for cosmetics products, which is both biodegradable and water and oil resistant. Its innovative design tackled the growing problem of marine plastic, which gave the enterprise its winning edge.

The jury is made up of representatives from Landbell Group and external experts including as the founder of the EU R2Pi project on Circular Economy Business Models, Alexis Figeac, and Suvi Haimi, the CEO of Sulapac.

129,"How brands, retailers and resellers are combating overproduction –","Total sales of apparel in the U.S. are estimated to have grown by nearly 15 percent this year, yet for all the increased consumption, a major issue remains: Brands are producing far more product than they can ever sell.

A new report from retail software company ShareCloth revealed that nearly 30 percent of fashion goods produced go unsold. Furthermore, more than 50 percent of fast fashion sold is thrown out less than a year later, with 12.8 million tons of clothing annually dumped into landfills.

This chronic overproduction has obvious negative effects on the environment, emitting 1.2 billion tons of greenhouse gases each year into the atmosphere, but it also will have a negative effect on fashion brands’ profits in the long run, potentially making the industry lose out on $52 billion in revenue by 2030, according to ShareCloth’s report.

“It becomes a wasteful practice on a large scale when major brands are left with swaths of unsold product they can’t move, and have to sell at a discounted rate,” said Kerry Cooper, president and COO of Rothy’s. “In some cases, luxury brands even destroy millions of dollars of unwanted products per year to maintain the exclusivity of their products.”

Supply and demand

 The core of overproduction comes down to the lead times of designing and producing fashion collections, taking much longer than the trends that inspire those collections usually last. Often, it can be incredibly difficult to predict whether something you are designing now will be appealing a year later, when it’s finally sold.

Additionally, brands often must meet minimum order quantities that force them to produce more than they might actually need. The logistics of inventory management can lead to a large amount of overproduction.

“Inventory management is a huge challenge for brands and retailers,” said Larisa Summers, svp of e-commerce at Optoro, which owns an e-commerce platform called Blinq where customers can buy deadstock items destined for a landfill. “They plan as much as they can, but it’s nearly impossible to forecast quantities perfectly. This can lead to excess inventory, which needs to be dealt with efficiently so as to recover as much value as possible.”

For brands that own their own factories, like footwear brand Rothy’s, this process is much easier.

“We own and operate our own factory, ensuring flexibility with order size and timeline,” Cooper said. “We break our inventory into categories of product we are confident will sell and product we want to test so that we have a multi-speed supply chain. With the confident product, we can carry deeper inventory on it, and we shouldn’t be out of stock. With new product, we can post a new color or style on our website in the morning, gauge demand by early afternoon and have a finished pair of shoes in our distribution just four days later. If a certain color doesn’t resonate, we’re not stuck with truckloads of a shoe that won’t sell.”



Retail options

 For brands that do not have that option, however, there are still alternatives. For one, retailers like Blinq have allowed brands to sell their excess material to third parties who will handle selling it to consumers.

“Blinq offers brands and retailers the opportunity to sell excess and returned inventory directly to consumers who are specifically looking for these types of goods,” Summers said. “Blinq’s customers are motivated not only by the great deals they can get on these products, but they also care about reducing the amount of unused goods that end up in landfills.”

Some brands have made extensive use of deadstock as a way to keep their own waste production low. Public School, for example, has used deadstock heavily over the last year, winning an award from the CFDA for doing so.

Things like the sale of deadstock, which can give new life to the products that would otherwise end up sitting in a landfill for hundreds of years, or emerging data technologies, which can help brands more accurately predict exactly what and how much they need to produce in order to meet demand without vastly overestimating what demand, can all help alleviate the problem of overproduction.

Designing with resale in mind can also help prevent some of the more dire environmental effects of overproduction. The RealReal’s partnership with Stella McCartney, which the two just renewed for 2019, was built explicitly to help keep Stella’s clothes out of landfills and ensure that every piece got multiple uses in its lifetime.

“Brands should be coming together to figure out how we can change this. Participating in the circular economy is such a great way to do that,” said Rati Sahi Levesque, chief merchant of The RealReal. “We’re really all about encouraging others in the space to embrace the circular economy, and our partnership with Stella can be a source for inspiration or a model to replicate.”

The rise of streetwear and luxury drops, which rely explicitly on producing less than what is in demand in order to ensure that every last piece gets sold, could also lead luxury brands to curb their overproduction problems.

The risks of overproduction

 Ultimately, avoiding overproduction comes down to being smart about the process before any piece of clothing is made. If brands keep going down the same course they’re on, their profits — and, more importantly, the environment — stand to lose.

“Shorten the time from demand to production or localize manufacturing, which typically means maintaining close control of your supply chain,” Cooper said, when asked the best way for brands to curb their overproduction. “In addition, build in flexibility to be able to ‘chase’ product that is selling well to fulfill demand. The flexibility to operate with small-batch production is key.”",Colombia,2018.12
166,FEAD cautions against Norway Basel amendment on plastic waste,"A proposed amendment to the Basel Convention tabled by Norway has been criticised by the European Federation of Waste Management and Environmental Services (FEAD).

The organisation that represents Europe’s waste management companies, cautioned in a statement that the amendment, while well-intentioned, is ‘bound to miss its own objective’ and could ‘hinder the development of an EU market for plastic waste’.

The proposal itself, submitted in June by the government of Norway to the Basel Convention Secretariat, would see scrap plastics added to Annex II of the Basel Convention, meaning the material would join a list of wastes for ‘special consideration’ requiring notification by exporting countries and consent by importing countries prior to export in a move designed to to address the ocean plastic crisis.

The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal, which came into force in 1992, governs the shipment and trade of hazardous wastes.

According to Norway’s proposed amendment, plastic waste would fall under three categories in the Basel Convention:
• Single polymer uncontaminated plastic waste (a revised entry B3010 in Annex IX of the Convention);
• Plastic waste requiring special consideration, for all plastics not covered by entry AXXXX of Annex VIII or B3010 of Annex IX (new entry Y48 in Annex II); and

As part of the entry B3010, any waste that does not comply with the B3010 has to be regarded as ‘amber listed’, requiring exporters to apply the notification procedure. The proposal adds three new criteria to the B3010: mixing/contamination is forbidden if it ‘prevents the recycling of the waste in an environmentally sound manner’, plastic waste is limited to ‘R3 – operation’ (the Convention’s definition of recycling of organic substances not used as solvents, excluding recovery operations) and recycling operations may ‘only involve minimal further mechanical preparatory treatment processes, if any’.

FEAD provides responses to these proposals in a position paper on Norway’s proposal, which labels the forbidding of mixing and contamination as ‘confusing, subject to variable interpretation and to legal uncertainty’ and ‘strongly opposes’ limiting the use of the ‘green list’ procedure to recycling operations and excluding other recovery operations, meaning exporters would have to provide notification to export plastic waste destined for other recovery operations, which FEAD says could lead to an ‘accurate waste congestion’ for countries with limited recycling and recovery capacity, due partly to the time needed to approve a notification.

FEAD’s position paper also provides a number of objectives to assist the development of a European plastics waste market. It calls for:
• A robust impact assessment since the Norwegian proposal could negatively impact plastic recycling and recovery;
• Complementing measures to stimulate European demand for recycled materials and investment in recycling capabilities (e.g packaging and plastics from WEEE (waste electrical and electronic equipment);
• Sufficient lead in time to allow new recycling infrastructure to be built;
• A clear commitment by the EU to limit delays for notified shipments; and

FEAD has previously made high-level representations in order to push for simplified waste material trade rules and a stimulation of the European secondary material market, calling on the European Commission to simplify the Waste Shipment Regulation (WSR) and harmonise enforcement across EU member states in November, and calling on EU member states to implement an appropriate framework of ‘pull’ mechanisms to complement recycling targets in the Circular Economy Package in October of last year.

“We firmly believe that this proposal is bound to miss its own objective: to combat marine litter, countries need to work on improving and expanding their respective waste management and particularly recycling capabilities, firmly combat illegal dumping.

“To reduce the amounts of refuse going into the world’s oceans we need an effective enforcement of waste management legislation, the expansion of waste treatment infrastructure, dissemination of information and best practice, as well as educational measures.

“The Basel Convention currently consists of two main procedures for waste shipment, which are called ‘amber listed’ and ‘green listed’. The government of Norway’s proposal would introduce new waste category for plastics under the Basel Convention.

“Presently, plastics for recycling and plastics for recovery fall under the same category B3010. This category does not require a notification procedure. Norway would like for plastics destined for recovery to fall under the ‘Y48’ category, which does require a notification procedure.

""Norway’s proposal could unfortunately hinder the development of an EU market for plastic waste, by raising the administrative burden and the costs of shipping plastic waste, or by making them simply impossible. Therefore, the new entries need to be clear to avoid confusion and varying interpretations.

""FEAD is also opposed to a system that restricts the use of the B3010 entry to plastic recycling under the green procedure, excluding plastic waste for recovery operations.""

212,SEPA plans to make Scotland’s metal sector go circular,"The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) has devised a new sector plan to make Scotland’s metal sector part of the nation’s emerging circular economy and improve environmental compliance and prevent illegal activity within the industry.

SEPA launched The Metals Sector Plan on 10 November, and is one of SEPA’s 16 detailed plans for individual sectors, such as the landfill sector plan, produced in accordance with SEPA’s overarching strategy, One Planet Prosperity, which seeks to lay out a path for Scotland to achieve greater resource efficiency. This is in line with the Scottish government’s circular economy strategy, ‘Making Things Last’.

The Metals Sector Plan covers all regulated activities that involve the production of metal from raw materials, the manufacture of metal products and the reprocessing, recycling and recovery of metallic wastes. It aims to reduce the amount of materials, energy and water used across the metals sector through a range of ambitious goals. These include:
• Displacing virgin raw materials with recycled or recovered metals within the industry;
• Ensuring operators can better collect individual metal types and alloys;
• Saving energy by promoting industry best practice in energy efficiency and low carbon energy projects for the Scottish metal manufacturing processes; and
• Regulating baseline water use at metals production sites and improving water efficiency.

“Full compliance with environmental regulations will not, by itself, deliver the transformational change required to secure our One Planet Prosperity objectives,” said Terry A’Hearn, Chief Executive of SEPA. “The Metals Sector Plan needs to unlock the potential for businesses to gain strength in resource efficiency and environmental innovation that will help them to succeed in their markets.”

The sector plan also identifies particular areas of inefficiency. For example, it cites a University of Cambridge report which states that the current quality of recycled steel within the UK is low due to poor control of its composition. It also points out that materials separated from metals at reprocessing facilities, such as plastic, are often unnecessarily disposed of as waste.

The need to increase resource efficiency in the metals sector is clear as key materials, such as copper, lead, tin and lithium, which is fundamental to electric vehicle and renewable energy manufacturing, are all in short supply.

A’Hearn added: “As the world faces shortages in metals and environmental constraints on their use, we will encourage the development of new technologies and business models that reduce resource use and environmental impact in ways that meet market needs.”

Within its plan, SEPA states that metal recycling and reprocessing sites had an environmental compliance rate of 88 per cent in 2017, compared to the national average of 90.9 per cent. As SEPA states: ‘This means that the sector is currently underperforming and that there are a number of operators that consistently perform poorly.’

A range of issues can contribute to non-compliance, such as storage of polluted waste on permeable ground, the non-provision of an impermeable surface, waste duty of care failing, issues with waste data reporting and administration, and the failure to depollute end-of-life vehicles.

Illegal activity can range from the small-scale breaking of vehicles to resell their separate parts, to industrial estates where unlicensed end-of-life vehicle (ELVs) operations take place. Initial assessment suggests that some are involved in wider criminality and a few have links to serious and organised crime groups and are a known violence and aggression risk.

The export of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), ELVs and vehicle parts are also susceptible to illegal activity and there is concern that some operators are still paying cash for metal, which has been banned since 2016, or do not have a Scrap Metal Dealers licence from their local authority.

A’Hearn adds: “Metals is a sector with a highly varied environmental performance. At one end, there are responsible operators who have a good track record of compliance and are seeking new business opportunities based on solving environmental challenges. At the other end, there are those who undertake activities illegally, ‘outside the system’, creating environmental risks and undermining legitimate operators.

“In the plan, we set out the ways we will try to get these illegal operators into the system or out of the market. This is tough work. We will use a combination of approaches and work with other organisations to try to achieve this aim. We will also drive those legitimate operators with outstanding compliance issues to solve them.”

SEPA’s plan to improve compliance and tackle illegal activity includes proposals to develop effective intervention strategies to tackle and deter illegal practices with Police Scotland, local authorities, the DVLA, industry trade bodies and other UK environment agencies, as well as making it easier for operators to understand their obligations through permit simplification and improved guidance on environmental compliance, and increasing scrutiny of duty of care compliance.

241,SEPA releases landfill sector plan,"The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) has launched a new sector plan for Scotland’s landfill waste sector in a bid to drive environmental compliance at sites, harness innovation and help the sector responsibly manage site closures and aftercare.

SEPA’s Landfill Sector Plan, released today (10 December) is one of 16 sector plans being launched this year as part of the regulator’s One Planet Prosperity strategy.

In response to mounting scientific evidence about climate change, resource scarcity and security, the sector plans set out a range of actions to help all regulated businesses meet – and go beyond – their compliance obligations.

There are currently 55 operational landfill sites and 217 non-operational sites regulated by SEPA in Scotland. Around four million tonnes of waste still enter Scotland’s landfills every year, though SEPA expects between 1.3-2 million tonnes of waste move from landfill every year over the next three years as a result of the Scottish Government’s 2021 ban on the landfilling of biodegradable waste.

The move is part of the Scottish Government’s circular economy strategy, ‘Making things last’, which includes aims to limit the amount of waste going to landfill to five per cent by 2025 and to reduce food waste by a third in the same timeframe.

In its Landfill Sector Plan, SEPA sets out a number of actions to improve compliance – and to go beyond compliance to help Scotland achieve its circular economy ambitions. These include:
• Focusing regulatory effort, including enforcement interventions, at sites with the worst compliance records and those with greatest community impact;
• Supporting operators to prepare for the ban on landfilling biodegradable municipal waste from 1 January 2021 and the target of no more than five per cent residual waste to landfill by 2025;
• Working with operators to ensure that all extractable landfill gas is utilised or, where this is not technically feasible, converted into less harmful gases;
• Identifying opportunities to help the landfill sector to develop and share best practice examples that support compliant operations;
• Developing effective intervention strategies to disrupt and deter illegal activity in partnership with Police Scotland, local authorities, industry trade bodies, other UK environment agencies and other relevant partners;
• Working with partners to support development of alternative products for landfill engineering, potentially reducing the reliance on virgin quarried clay;
• Developing a forum for businesses to work in partnership with SEPA and other stakeholders to consider the sources of the energy used, with the aim of moving away from fossil fuels; and
• Working co-operatively with the landfill sector, communities and other partners to promote and develop sustainable land uses for restored landfills.

Commenting on the sector plan, SEPA Chief Executive Terry A’Hearn said: “This plan is ambitious. It spells out how we will use our full suite of regulatory powers, including the creation of a new national enforcement team, in clearer and more powerful ways. It also sets out some new ways such as novel partnerships that we will develop and use to support innovation and transformation in this sector.



“As Scotland’s environmental regulator, we’ll work to ensure operators protect the environment from the impacts of landfilling and ensure that communities are safeguarded. As some wastes break down, they produce powerful emissions such as leachate (a highly polluting liquid that poses a risk to downgrading surface water quality and groundwater aquifers if not adequately contained, extracted and treated) and powerful greenhouse gases such as methane that contribute to climate change.

“The transition to a circular economy is an environmental and economic win-win for Scotland. That said, it’s important that we work to ensure operators responsibly manage site closures and aftercare.”

282,Zero Waste Europe calls for carpet industry to go circular,"A collaborative group of carpet manufacturers, industry associations and members of civil society are working together to urge the European Commission and EU member states to make the carpet industry circular by introducing mandatory rules across Europe.

A call to action launched by Zero Waste Europe (ZWE), a European network of communities and local leaders working towards a completely circular economy, has already received support from DSM-Niaga, a science and technology circular economy enterprise, sustainable carpet manufacturers Interface, and Tarkett, a carpet and flooring specialist.

ZWE’s idea was a direct response to Eunomia’s publication, 'Policy toolkit for carpet circularity in EU member states', released on December 4 (yesterday). The toolkit provides a range of options for policy-makers to choose from, with the aim of accelerating the circular economy in the carpet sector while simultaneously helping to achieve the EU waste recycling and landfilling targets – a concept made all the more pressing considering 14 countries risk missing their 2020 EU recycling targets.

Joan Marc Simon, Executive Director at ZWE, said: “Current legislative and economic frameworks in the carpet sector lock the industry into a wasteful linear system. To build a true Circular Economy we need new rules and incentives to bring the whole sector to a higher level of ambition. This is why we support the measures proposed in the Eunomia toolkit, and we call on the European Commission and Member States to set the legal framework that will make the carpet sector go circular.”

Through the European Commission and member states, ZWE hopes to have all carpet companies agree to several mandatory rules by 2025. The rules would state that all commercial and household carpets put on the market should be: free of potentially harmful chemicals; reusable; separately collected; and fully recyclable.

This would entail a gradual phasing out of virgin materials, and a transition towards safe and healthy components that include an increasing rate of recycled or renewable content – but this can only be truly effective as a sustainable idea if adopted across the entire carpet industry.

As Myriam Tryjefaczka, Sustainability and Public Affairs Director at Tarkett EMEA, said: “Material transparency, eco-design and either closed or open loops are fundamental to develop a healthy and circular economy in the long run.”

ZWE, DSM-Niaga, Interface and Tarkett all support the use of transparent Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes, which would create necessary incentives to drive this transition. These companies commit to supporting the EPR schemes in countries that are considering introducing mandatory measures which would allow the carpet sector to go circular.

Lukas Hoex, Manager of Strategic Growth at DSM-Niaga, said: “DSM-Niaga is concerned about carpet waste, and believes producer responsibility is a big part of the solution. Manufacturers of any kind of product, also carpet, have to design and make products with recycling in mind, and support the collection of products after use. Mandatory disclosure of ingredients is in our view an urgent party of extended producer responsibility, since it supports the consumer to make better choices and then supports recyclers to handle products in the right way.”

Meanwhile at Interface, circular solutions are already in place. Geanne van Arkel, Head of Sustainable Development in Interface EMEA, said: “We’ve instituted circular solutions to creating products including identification and elimination of materials of concern, introduction of recycled materials and new processes to reclaim and reuse products across our global business.

“As a result, 58 per cent of raw materials in our products are recycled or bio-based. By creating modular flooring products that can be installed, replaced, reused and recycled simply we are leading our industry to design with the planet and people in mind. This transformative approach shows it is possible to make a profit sustainably. If we can do this, other businesses can too.”",Colombia,2018.12
298,Scottish lighting company develops circular LED business model,"Glasgow-based EGG Lighting has developed a new circular business model that could see businesses save on LED lighting, while reducing their carbon footprint.

For six months, EGG has been testing its circular economy business model with help from the Scottish logistics, construction and distribution specialists W H Malcolm. The trial has been supported by Zero Waste Scotland, the European Regional Development Funds and the Scottish Government.

EGG’s circular business model has introduced a new modular approach to lighting, which sees only the LED and driver parts replaced, leaving the rest of the unit in place. The company is also pioneering a ‘lighting as a service’ model that would see businesses continue to receive regular upgrades to the technology, but without having to replace the entire unit. This allows businesses to upgrade their LED technology without having to constantly pay for new lights and without having to dispose of the entire unit.

One of the main successes of the trial has been the use of dynamic zone control, which sees lighting adapt to how space is used, saving around 70 per cent on the running cost of lights.

In the UK some 48.5 per cent of lamps are recycled, with 6,132 tonnes of waste collected for recycling. Uptake of LED lighting is rapidly increasing as it is much more energy efficient and longer lasting than old fluorescent-style lights. However, waste levels are also increasing due to the technology advancing at a rapid rate, requiring businesses to making regular upgrades.

Commenting on the project, Iain Gulland, Chief Executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “Continuous innovation doesn’t have to mean continuous waste. By factoring future improvements into their designs, EGG Lighting is helping to make their product fit to last. Their work shows that cutting out waste and changing how we deliver services can deliver clear economic savings in the long run, with benefits for both the supplier and the customer.”

Brian O'Reilly, Managing Director, EGG Lighting, said: “Just as you get a new smartphone every year, so there are constant updates to lighting technology. But shelling out for the latest technology year on year is expensive to the end user and wasteful for the supplier. We want to give businesses the benefits of the latest technology without them having to upgrade their hardware. Zero Waste Scotland’s support has helped us prepare this technology for the market, and we’re looking forward to rolling it out to more clients.”

EGG’s trial of its new business model has received funding from the Circular Economy Investment Fund, which is part of the £73-million Resource Efficient Circular Economy Accelerator Programme, and represents but the latest example of the Scottish Government’s investment in circular economy initiatives across the country.",Colombia,2018.12
320,Is price the sole determiner of luxury? –,"Last week, influencers gathered for the launch of a new luxury footwear brand called Palessi, selling shoes for hundreds of dollars. Of course, Palessi was fake — a ruse created by Payless to showcase that its affordable shoes were just as good as (or at least good enough to pass for) luxury shoes.

While this stunt may have gotten Payless some publicity, along with providing a little schadenfreude toward the wealthy shoppers who were duped into buying a $20 pair of shoes for almost $700, it also begs the question of luxury’s complicated relationship with price. Does something have to be expensive to be luxury? Are “luxury” and “affordable” mutually exclusive descriptors?

“There has definitely been a shift in how consumers think about luxury,” said Brian Lee, associate director at Gartner L2. “There has been a ‘democratization’ of luxury fashion, where it is no longer exclusive to people of a certain socio-economic class or group. Due to increasing accessibility and knowledge, primarily through digital channels like online e-commerce, resale and social media, more and more consumers are able to shop luxury products to varying degrees.”

Accessibility vs. exclusivity

 That democratization has taken many forms. Resale sites like The RealReal have given more customers than ever access to products from premium luxury houses at a cost that is more affordable. Luxury brands do not often discount their products due to the perceived damage to their brand image that would ensue. That is why luxury brands often sit out of Black Friday. The so-called circular economy has given rise to a large new segment of consumers who are wearing and evangelizing luxury brands, despite not having paid an exorbitant price for it.

“Rent the Runway has a similar effect of creating more familiarity between designer brands and consumers who may not have worn items at as high a price point as before,” said Lauren Price, director of client strategy at Gartner L2. “But there is a notable lack of premium luxury brands on Rent the Runway, as these brands want to maintain that exclusivity.”

Thanks to accessibility of luxury, the question of what the term means has become more individualized. Some, like Italic’s Jeremy Cai, view luxury as something that is aspirational, which changes based on your income level and tastes.

The luxury experience

 Luxury can also refer to the quality of the experience that comes along with the product. The service a customer receives when they enter the store, a personalized note from the brand or even beautiful packaging can all be symbols of luxury that are distinct from price and quality of the product.

“There’s a lot more investment in packaging today, and that’s something that can give the same sort of feeling of a luxury brand,” said Corey Pierson, co-founder and CEO of customer intelligence platform Custora. “There are a lot of brands outside of fashion that are not what you might call luxury but are creating customer experiences that are on par with luxury brands.

“I subscribe to a coffee-of-the-month club, and every month it arrives in this beautiful package with a handwritten note from the owner of the company explaining what the coffee is. That’s creating an absolutely luxurious experience. Customer experience is an integral part to creating the feeling of luxury.”

Streetwear’s disruption

 One of the biggest disruptors in the relationship between luxury and price is streetwear. Brands that are typically priced much lower than luxury brands compete for the same customers and are spoken of in the same breath.

“A classic example would be Supreme, where MSRP is generally affordable and comparable to many other affordable brands, but they compete with luxury brands due to brand cachet and scarcity due to limited product and distribution,” said Price. “It is in resale when prices ramp up significantly. Similarly, limited-edition shoes and collaborations also create opportunities for non-luxury brands to target the luxury market without necessarily having a luxury price point.”

Sneakers, in particular, add more confusion to the price situation. The majority of people who own Yeezy sneakers probably paid between $700 and $1,000 dollars for a pair, which places them firmly in luxury price territory. But those sales come through the bustling resale market. The actual retail price of the sneakers is usually less than $300. While the actual price may be relatively low, most people will probably pay luxury prices for them.

As the circular economy grows, streetwear continues to dominate fashion and younger generations of consumers with radically different views on their relationship with brands become more central in fashion, luxury must rethink its own relationship with price in order to remain relevant. Ultimately, elements outside of price will be just as, if not more, important to what constitutes luxury, although price may never truly go out the window as a factor in what makes something luxurious.

“Luxury, more than ever in its history, should be defined as a state of mind, just as much as by its hallmarks: exclusivity, craftsmanship, price, quality,” said Chris Paradysz, founder of PMX Agency. “While these have always been true, luxury’s accessibility through technology innovations plus consumer behavioral changes have disrupted its purity. Price still differentiates, but it’s no longer joined at the hip with exclusivity.”",Colombia,2018.12
393,Increase in waste generated sees drop in Scotland’s recycling,"Scotland has reported a slight drop in its recycling rate to 58.9 per cent for 2017 as the total amount of waste generated increased by 5.5 per cent, according to official figures from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).

Official statistics for waste from all sources (WFAS) released on Wednesday (27 March) reveal that Scotland’s recycling rate fell from 59.1 per cent in 2016 (a revision of the originally reported 61 per cent figure), to 58.9 per cent in 2017. This was despite recycling 142,195 tonnes more waste than the previous year in real terms, sending a total of 6.93 million tonnes to be recycled.

The increase in recycling was offset by the fact that 620,000 tonnes of extra waste was generated in 2017, bringing the total amount of waste generated in Scotland that year to 11.82 million tonnes. Most of this increase can be attributed to construction and demolition (C&D) waste, which rose by 600,000 tonnes, representing an increase of 10.8 per cent.

The figures also show a significant increase in the amount of food waste being sent for composting or anaerobic digestion, rising by 16.6 per cent to 302,829 tonnes; improvements in organics recycling were a key part of the large nine per cent rise in Scotland’s WFAS recycling rate between 2015 and 2016. The amount of biodegradable municipal waste sent to landfill also fell once again, down from 1.14 million tonnes in 2016 to 1.09 million tonnes in 2017.

The overall quantity of waste being sent to landfill increased by 0.1 per cent in 2017 to 32.6 per cent of all waste – significant work remains to be done to achieve Scotland’s goal of a maximum five per cent of waste to landfill by 2025 – with the total amount of waste disposed of through both landfill and incineration increasing by 1.3 per cent to four million tonnes. A total of 761,581 tonnes of waste were sent for energy recovery in 2017, an increase of 14.7 per cent from 2016.

Scotland has made significant efforts in recent times to move away from a traditional linear economic model, which sees products thrown away at their end of life, towards a circular model that keeps materials in circulation for as long as possible. In 2016, the Scottish Government launched its circular economy strategy, ‘Making Things Last’, in collaboration with SEPA and Zero Waste Scotland, setting out a path towards more circular and sustainable use of resources. It has also made funding available to help businesses move to circular models and forged ahead with plans to introduce a deposit return scheme (DRS) for beverage containers in a bid to reduce plastic waste.

Commenting on the figures, Iain Gulland, Chief Executive at Zero Waste Scotland, said: “We are getting smarter about ways to deal with waste but the real challenge is in reducing it in the first place. More thought and planning needs to be given to circular economy approaches that enable products to be used time and again.



“Improvements can take place across the board. The implementation of the deposit return scheme is an example of one way where materials can be given a new life rather than simply being thrown away. To make an impact on waste, we need to take this approach to reusing our resources and make it common place.”

Terry A’Hearn, SEPA’s Chief Executive, added: “The scale of the environmental challenge is enormous and we know that in Scotland we currently use the resources of three planets, but only have one.

“The most successful countries in the 21st century will be resource efficient, circular economies, where what once was waste is valued as a resource. As such, the latest figures give communities and businesses a fresh focus for the opportunity ahead.”

Though Scotland’s WFAS recycling rate is very healthy, it remains in last place in the UK when it comes to its Waste from Households (WfH) recycling rate, with a recycling rate of 43.5 per cent. In the 2017 calendar year, Wales retained its place as the top recycling nation on that front, recycling 57.6 per cent of its WfH, while Northern Ireland overtook England, rising to 46.3 per cent. England increased its WfH recycling rate to 45.2 per cent in 2017, though figures for 2017/18 show that it fell to 44.8 per cent across that period.

517,Education is key on Global Recycling Day 2019,"The second annual Global Recycling Day is taking place today (18 March) across the world, aiming to promote the importance of recycled material, which organisers have termed ‘the seventh resource’ after water, air, oil, coal, minerals and natural gas.

Global Recycling Day was first recognised in 2018 and was set up by the Bureau for International Recycling (BIR), a trade association representing the recycling industry on the global stage. The BIR states that, through Global Recycling Day, it is seeking to ‘change the mindset of governments, businesses, communities and individuals around the world, to see recyclables as resource – not waste.’

This goal has never been more important than it is now, with a new report from the UN Environment Programme explaining that the world’s use of raw materials has more than tripled since 1970.

The ‘Global Resources Outlook 2019’ was put together by the International Resource Panel (IRP), a scientific body aiming to encourage a more sustainable use of natural resources. Published last week during this year’s UN Environment Assembly (11-15 March), the report examines trends in the consumption of natural resource, suggesting that by 2060, raw material usage could double to 190 billion tonnes.

This conclusion is in line with a 2018 report produced by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The OECD predicted that in the years until 2060, the recycling sector will grow faster than mining or minerals use, but that ‘the strong increase in demand for materials implies that both primary and secondary materials use increase at roughly the same speed’.

The impacts of this increased resource use are increasingly negative, the IRP report claims. If trends continue, by 2060, greenhouse gas emissions could increase by 43 per cent, while natural landscapes will degrade, with forests reducing by over 10 per cent and other habitats like grasslands by around 20 per cent. In addition, resource extraction and processing is currently responsible for 90 per cent of biodiversity loss and water stress (when demand for clean water exceeds the amount available). If this trend continues, it is stated, the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement will be ‘difficult to meet’.

Moving towards a circular economy, whereby resources are kept in use through recycling and reuse, is key to reducing the negative impacts of the extraction and processing of raw materials. For instance, the report shows that the climate change impacts of aluminium recycling are between 3.5 and 20 per cent of that of primary production.

‘What is needed is a move from linear to circular flows through a combination of extended product life cycles, intelligent product design and standardization and reuse, recycling and remanufacturing,’ the report states.

We live in worrying times, but the BIR’s goal may also be more achievable now than ever before, with governments and businesses showing themselves to be more willing to enact waste reduction and recycling policies – in no small part due to the changing demands of consumers and the growing public knowledge about the effects on the environment of a linear (take-make-dispose) consumption model.

This year’s Global Recycling Day is based around the theme ‘Recycling into the Future’, and focuses on ‘the power of youth, education and innovation’. The BIR has shared materials to be used in schools and youth clubs based around recycling, including recycling facts and tips on things to make out of recycling goods.

This approach can be highly effective, as a recent poll by the Midcounties Co-operative reveals. 2,000 people with children between five and 18 were questioned, and results show that four in 10 parents have been told off by their child for throwing away something recyclable, while half of children who go shopping with their parents provide tips such as to take a reusable bag. Parents largely credited schools with educating their children about waste and recycling.

The Midcounties Co-operative is launching its 1Change programme, which is working to educate people about single-use plastic – and is partnering with schools to take the message to young people. Mike Pickering, Co-operative social responsibility manager at said: “Reducing single-use plastic is a high priority for our 700,000 members, so we wanted to understand whether this desire was making its way to the next generation.

“Our results show, happily, that the mantle is also being passed down, with children showing real engagement in sustainable living – something we see regularly through our work with schools.”

780,MPs launch inquiry into e-waste and the circular economy,"Parliament’s Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) has launched an inquiry into the circular economy and electronic waste (e-waste).

Announced today (27 June), the EAC, which considers the extent to which government policies and those of public bodies contribute to environmental protection and sustainability, will investigate the environmental and human health impacts of the disposal of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) and what is being done to move towards a circular economy for electronic goods.

The growth in the use and sale of personal electronic devices such as mobile phones, tablets and laptops has led to a dramatic increase in the amount of e-waste generated globally, with 44.7 million tonnes of waste being produced around the world in 2017, 90 per cent of which was sent to landfill, incinerated, illegally traded or treated in a sub-standard way. Half of the e-waste produced globally comes from Europe and the US, with the EU predicted to produce 12 million tonnes by 2020.

E-waste can contain up to 60 different metals and chemicals, which, if disposed of incorrectly, can be hazardous to the environment and human health through contamination of the soil, pollution of water sources and exposing people to toxic substances.

Though exporting e-waste to developing countries is banned, 1.3 million tonnes of undocumented e-waste is estimated to be exported from the EU every year, with the UK ranked as the worst offender in the EU by the Basel Action Network in February this year.

The global dumping of e-waste has led to countries taking action, with Nigeria investing £1.53 million in WEEE recycling to deal with the 1.1 million tonnes of e-waste it receives every year, while Thailand banned the import of e-waste last year in response to fears it was becoming a ‘dumping ground’ for the world’s e-waste.

Furthermore, the improper disposal and lack of recycling of e-waste also is seeing significant resources leaking out of the economy; global e-waste is estimated to be worth $62.5 billion (£49.3 billion), due to the intrinsic value of the materials used in electronic devices, such as rare earth elements (REEs).

On a domestic scale, the UK produces 24.9 kilogrammes (kg) of e-waste per person, higher than the EU average of 17.7kg. E-waste in the UK is managed under the EU’s WEEE Directive and WEEE Regulations 2013.

As part of those regulations, a producer responsibility scheme is in place, which holds producers financially responsible for the end-of-life management of their products, with annual targets for WEEE collection set by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).

These targets are calculated based on the WEEE Directive’s target of 65 per cent of the average annual weight of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) placed on the market over the previous three years. The target for 2019 has been set at 550,577 tonnes, a 12 per cent increase on 2018 levels. The UK missed its WEEE collection target of 537,065 tonnes by 44,500 tonnes in 2018. Where collection falls short of the target, a compliance fee is paid by producers according to market share, which is then put towards projects to increase WEEE recycling and reuse. The total fund for 2017 stood at £8 million.

Commenting on the launch of the inquiry, Chair of the EAC, Mary Creagh MP, said: “Our old fridges, freezers, computers, TVs, kettles and mobile phones are piling up in a ‘tsunami of e-waste’. New phone launches, cheaper goods, and built-in obsolescence have contributed to the growth of electronic waste in recent years.

“The UK produces more e-waste than the EU average. We are missing EU targets and are one of the worst offenders for exporting waste to developing countries, who are ill equipped to dispose of it in a socially and environmentally responsible way.

“Our attitude to e-waste is unsustainable and the need for radical action clear. We will be investigating the UK’s e-waste industry and looking at how we can create a circular economy for electronic goods.”

The EAC’s inquiry will be seeking answers to the following questions:
• What steps are being taken to move towards a circular economy for electronic goods? How can the UK Government support this transition?
• What is the environmental and human health risk from e-waste? How significant is it and who is most at risk?
• How can secondary markets for electrical goods be improved? What incentives are required to implement these markets?
• Why does recovering materials from electronic waste pose a significant challenge? What support is required to facilitate the adoption of recovery technologies?
• Are UK WEEE collection targets achievable? What challenges do UK producer compliance schemes and WEEE reprocessors face in meeting the collection targets?
• What causes fraud in the UK’s e-waste system? How can this be addressed?
• What action can the UK Government take to prevent the illegal export of e-waste to the developing world?
• What proposals does the UK Government need to consider as part of its consultation on WEEE?
• Is UK public awareness of e-waste recycling satisfactory? If not, how can it be improved?

If you would like to contribute to the inquiry, written evidence should be submitted through the inquiry page by 5pm on Friday 16 August.",Colombia,2019.06
32,French law says companies can’t destroy unsold stock,"The French Government is set to ban the destruction of unsold non-food goods as part of new legislation on the circular economy, though concerns have been raised that it does not go far enough.

The new measure, announced by Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on 4 June, would mean that unsold consumer goods such as clothes, electronics and furniture would have to be sent for recycling or reuse by companies.

The plan is part of the Circular Economy Bill, set to be discussed by the government in July. Other proposals in the bill include an obligation for online marketplaces to ensure that the collection and recycling of the products they market on their sites are properly financed and to implement extended producer responsibility (EPR) regimes for items such as sports and DIY equipment and cigarette filters.

According to Philippe’s office, some €650 million (£576 million) worth of consumer goods are thrown away or destroyed every year in France, a practice Philippe said was tantamount to “a scandal”.

The law anticipates special arrangements for the luxury sector, where items are often destroyed to maintain an element of exclusivity for a brand – last year British fashion brand Burberry admitted to burning unsold clothing and accessories worth £28.6 million every year to avoid them going to market for a cut price – while items that must be used by a certain date will also have special arrangements.

However, despite the waste reduction proposal being described as a “world first” by Philippe, not all groups in France have welcomed the move wholeheartedly. Paris-based NGO Zero Waste France stated that authorising unsold items to be sent for recycling “more or less amounts to destroying them and not reusing them”.

The group states that it would be better for the law to clearly obligate the reuse of these items, a move that would be more in line with the circular economy ethos. This would be more in tune with the law introduced in 2016 that requires supermarkets over 400 square metres in size to sign agreements with one or more organisations to redistribute unused food.

Zero Waste France has also criticised the lack of targets for reducing single-use plastic and the lack of new bans for certain single-use plastic items in the Circular Economy Bill, despite the EU’s Single-Use Plastic Directive, which was voted through by the European Parliament on 27 March, providing for the banning of more single-use plastic items such as plastic cutlery and food containers.",Colombia,2019.06

354,Australia urged to move towards a circular economy on recycling,"Australia should take its cue from the circular economy on recycling, reusing its waste rather than sending it to landfill, says a recent report by business advisory firm EY. It added that Australians need to have confidence in their country’s recycling system and should look upon it as a resource rather than waste.

The accounting firm affirmed a combined approach to waste which included households, local councils and the private sector is needed to “restore faith” in the country’s recycling system. This would lead to the start of a win-win circular economy.

Such an economy can be achieved when “people minimize waste and make the most of resources. Shifting to a more circular economy will grow the economy, increase jobs and reduce impacts on the environment,” according to the Victorian State Government.

Australia’s strategy of dealing with its waste by sending it to China for processing was thrown into confusion in 2017. It was then when China decided to tighten the restrictions on contamination for accepting foreign waste. The new standards effectively banned all Australian paper, plastics and textiles because of their high contamination rate.

Before the Chinese ban, it had been sending 619,000 tonnes of recycling waste to China every year.

Terence L. Jeyaretnam, an environmental and sustainability expert who is also a partner at EY in Melbourne, described the present methods as an example of a “lost opportunity”.

“Through better sorting of recyclables, reducing contamination and developing markets for our recycled waste, Australia could take advantage of this lost opportunity sitting in our kerbside bins,” he said.

He added that Australians were missing out on up to $324 million of value in our waste bins and needed to change to adapt to the future.

“The old way of sorting our waste is not the right fit for 21st century Australia,” he said in the study, adding that “not only does it lead to poor environmental outcomes, it’s preventing us from grasping an opportunity worth hundreds of millions per year.”

The report underlined the need for Australia to view waste as a valuable resource saying it “will only be realized if households take a more diligent approach to sorting, councils assist though education and infrastructure and there is a greater focus on waste as a resource.”

It points to a lack of confidence currently amongst households with the country’s recycling methods.

“Instead of ‘waste’ we need consumers to see a tradable asset, a commodity with a market value. The first step in changing consumers behavior is restoring their belief that what they are putting in the recycling bin is actually being recycled,” said the discussion paper.

Restoring the customer’s faith in the broken recycling system would be the first step towards creating a viable circular economy and finding a solution to the recycling crisis in Australia, summarized the report.",Colombia,2019.09
491,Scottish Government to table Circular Economy Bill,"Scotland’s 2019/20 Programme for Government was published yesterday (3 September) setting out plans to tackle climate change and drive progress towards net zero carbon emissions by 2045.

The programme outlined Scotland’s plans for a new Circular Economy Bill, which aims to change attitudes towards waste and tackle the country’s throw-away culture. The new bill will include provisions to introduce charges on items such as single-use coffee cups – tackling the 4,000 tonnes of waste beverage cups create in Scotland each year – and a new penalty for littering from vehicles.

Consultations on the new bill will begin shortly, with the aim that the legislation will be brought forward in the coming year.

Launching the Programme for Government, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “Earlier this year, I acknowledged that Scotland – like the rest of the world – faces a climate emergency. We are now committed to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045 at the latest – earlier than any other UK nation.

“This year’s Programme for Government is an important part of our response to the climate emergency, containing measures which will reduce emissions while supporting sustainable and inclusive growth.”

Commenting on the Circular Economy Bill, Sturgeon added: “Scotland has the opportunity to become a world leader in this essential industry of the future – we must grasp that opportunity.

“We will also continue our efforts to reduce waste, and to reuse and recycle materials more effectively. To encourage this further, we will introduce a Circular Economy Bill in the coming year. Among other things, it will enable changes to be applied for items such as single-use coffee cups.”

The programme places Scotland’s plans for its deposit return scheme (DRS), set to be introduced in 2021, at the heart of its efforts to reduce waste. The DRS aims to increase recycling rates through placing a 20 pence fee on top of the cost of drinks containers, which can then be recouped when the container is returned for recycling.

Although Scotland’s upcoming DRS has been met with a mixed response from the waste industry, with critics suggesting that the scheme will negatively impact kerbside collections, the Scottish Government claim that the DRS will reduce the £46 million spent each year on litter removal and will achieve carbon savings equivalent to taking 85,000 cars off the roads.

Taking further action to cut down on single-use plastics, the Scottish Government also announced that it will shortly consult on raising the minimum amount for the single-use carrier bag charge from five pence to 10 pence, in line with the standards set out in the European Union’s Single Use Plastic Directive.

Despite efforts to target waste reduction, Scotland’s recycling rate fell from 59.1 per cent in 2016 to 58.9 per cent in 2017, due to an extra 620,000 tonnes of waste – mostly from construction and demolition (C&D) – being generated in 2017.

Scotland did, however, see a significant increase in the amount of food waste being sent for composting or anaerobic digestion, which rose by 16.6 per cent to 302,829 tonnes in 2017 – the Scottish Government states that 80 per cent of households now have access to food waste collections.

In order to build on the progress made in food waste recycling, the programme commits to exploring opportunities to require businesses to publicly report food waste and surplus, with a consultation to be carried out on obligating food retail sites to redistribute unsold edible food products. Further, the Scottish Government will also consult on the existing rural exemption for household food waste collections and review the food waste separation requirements.

Regards to dry recycling, the Scottish Government’s programme commits to begin an evaluation of the Scottish Household Recycling Charter and review the Charter’s Code of Practice, both of which govern how local authority kerbside recycling is carried out in Scotland.

The programme also outlined the government’s plans for a ‘Green New Deal’, which will accelerate investment in projects to achieve the net zero goal. Highlighting the value of bioenergy in decarbonising our energy system, the programme laid out plans to consult on a draft bioenergy action plan later this year.

The Scottish Government also plans to develop the industrial biotechnology sector, which is working to replace existing fuels with sustainable, non-fossil based alternatives.

Scotland has been at the forefront of the move towards a circular economy, publishing its circular economy strategy, ‘Making Things Last’, in 2016, which set out the government’s plans to use resources more efficiently. As part of this strategy, the government set a target to limit the amount of waste going to landfill to five per cent by 2025.

Shortly before the publication of the circular economy strategy, Sturgeon announced a £70 million investment programme to help small to medium-sized enterprises (SME) implement circular business models. The government has also set up four ‘Circular Regions’ – Glasgow, Edinburgh, Tayside and the North East – which each receive tailored support to promote local circular opportunities.

In October 2018, Zero Waste Scotland released a report revealing the value of the circular economy for Scotland, with figures suggesting that the benefits of adopting circular business practices could be worth £1 billion in the regions of Tayside, Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.
