32,The shift from a throwaway society to a more circular economy,"Associate Environment Minister Eugenie Sage: ""It's about shifting from a throwaway society to one in which we are more careful about how resources flow through the economy"".

OPINION: Recently a small male pilot whale washed ashore on a beach in southern Thailand. It died of starvation after swallowing 80 plastic shopping bags. One of the finalists in this year's International Wildlife Photographer competition shows a tiny seahorse latched onto a plastic-stemmed cotton bud.

Scientists estimate there are more than 150 million tonnes of plastics in the ocean today. If nothing changes, then it is projected that plastic in oceans will weigh more than all the fish that live in them by 2050.

As associate minister for the environment with responsibility for waste, it's my job to make sure New Zealand does its share to clean up our act when it comes to plastic pollution.

Recently Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and I announced the Government's plan to phase out single-use plastic bags. At the weekend I announced a work programme to tackle the tougher problems associated with the mountains of waste we produce.

The first task is to expand the number of landfills the waste disposal levy applies to. New Zealand has more than 420 known landfills, and the levy applies to only 11 per cent of them – largely the metropolitan landfills accepting household waste – and it applies to only an estimated 30 per cent of the waste stream.

According to surveys done in Auckland, construction and demolition waste accounts for about 85 per cent of the waste stream. Yet the levy applies to very few landfills where this material ends up. The levy needs to be extended to level the playing field across different types of waste and provide an incentive to encourage materials recovery and divert waste from landfill. We'll also consider whether the levy rate should be increased, consult the public and ensure the costs are reasonable.

Revenue from the landfill levy will be recycled to help councils, progressive businesses and community organisations minimise and divert waste from landfills. It will increase the ability of the Waste Minimisation Fund to invest in activities that support reduction, recovery, reuse, remanufacturing, repurposing, recycling and composting. Our waste plan will help create more jobs in the recycling and materials recovery sectors.

The second and long-overdue task is to improve the data and information available on waste. We lack a full national picture of what is going to landfill, and what is being recovered or recycled. Knowing this is critical if we are to make informed decisions.

The third big change is to develop and implement mandatory product stewardship schemes, starting with tyres, so that everyone helps take responsibility for the waste they create.

We have good law in New Zealand in the Waste Minimisation Act 2008, but have failed over the past decade to use the opportunities it provides to identify priority products and create mandatory stewardship schemes for them.

Canada has 94 product categories covered by legislated schemes where producers, retailers and consumers of products all share in the costs of dealing with those products at the end of their life and reduce waste to landfill. New Zealand has only 15 schemes, all of them voluntary, with varying levels of coverage.

I have asked ministry experts to work with businesses and the tyre sector to develop a mandatory product stewardship scheme to prevent end-of-life tyres ending up in stockpiles and posing fire and environmental risks or being illegally dumped. Unlike most other OECD countries, we have no pricing incentives to fund effective tyre take-back schemes, improved management or domestic tyre recycling.

I have also asked officials to resume work on developing more mandatory product stewardship schemes to deal with other key waste streams such as e-waste (starting with lithium batteries), and agrichemical containers. This will build on the great work of the AgRecovery Scheme.

New Zealand is feeling the effects of the Chinese Government's decision to close its borders to mixed recyclables so that China is no longer a dumping ground for the world's rubbish. China's decision creates both challenges and opportunities.

The Ministry for the Environment has created a taskforce dedicated to leading the response to this challenge, with an external working group with representatives from councils and industry to provide independent advice. It's due to report back in the next two months.

We currently recycle just 28 per cent of the 15.5 million tonnes of waste we discard in landfills every year.

New Zealand does reuse and recycle glass, clean and separated cardboard and paper, certain types of plastic, and some organic wastes. So please keep recycling. But we can and must do better.

It's about shifting from a throwaway society to one in which we are more careful about how resources flow through the economy and recognise that the materials in ""waste"" are too valuable to throw away.

We can separate our economic growth from the creation and consumption of products that will pollute or damage nature. This transition to a circular approach to the economy, where products are made to be repaired and reused rather than discarded, or the materials in them are recovered at the end of their life to be reused in other products, will happen only with the right mix of incentives and investment. That's where grants from the Waste Minimisation Fund, funded by the landfill levy, can help.

The Sustainable Business Network recently produced two reports that identified how, by using circular economy principles, Auckland's economy could be up to $NZ8.8 billion better off. The reports also concluded that, despite the increase in economic activity, there would be significantly lower carbon emissions.

It's also important that consumers, large, and small become more aware of the true environmental and social costs of their purchases and become more conscious consumers who choose reused and recycled content products.

More businesses are recognising the opportunities for change. Major supermarkets and hardware chains are phasing out single use plastic bags, some supermarkets are no longer selling plastic straws or plastic-stemmed cotton buds. In June I launched the New Zealand Plastics Declaration signed by international companies Amcor, Danone, L'Oréal, Mars, PepsiCo, The Coca-Cola Company, Unilever and Nestlé and New Zealand-based businesses Foodstuffs, Countdown, New Zealand Post and Frucor Suntory.

These firms have committed to use 100 per cent reusable, recyclable or compostable packaging in their New Zealand operations by 2025 or earlier. These companies care about the environment – but they also care about public perception of their brand. Doing the correct thing is also the smart thing.

147,HPE promotes 'circular economy' for end-of-use tech,"HPE is planning to show businesses worldwide that throwing old tech and assets into landfill is not the best option when it comes to end-of-use disposal.

The company has launched a first-of-its-kind Circular Economy Report. The report will help businesses track carbon, energy, and landfill waste savings for those who return end-of-use assets to HPE through the HPE Technology Renewal Centres.

A recent HPE Financial Services study found that 69% of respondent companies have an IT sustainability strategy in place, and 79% would commit to a strategy.

HPE says the report will help businesses meet sustainability goals, support reporting requirements on environmental impact, CSR updates, and tax compliance.

HPE says that organisations are constantly expanding their IT infrastructure to store and process more information, particularly to harness the value of connectivity and data to generate business value.

By using less space, materials, and energy businesses can thrive in a resource-constrained world. This is the circular economy, HPE believes.

“A circular economy reimagines a take-make-dispose system to a circular and regenerative economy. It considers the full product lifecycle: from resource extraction, to product design and use – all the way to end-of-use management to extend product and material life and lower total cost of ownership.”

“From a customer perspective, key drivers for a circular Economy approach are new sources of business value and infrastructure efficiency. From a sustainability perspective, the need to move to a circular economy is driven by a consumption rate that is beyond the earth's ability to replenish.”

The report draws on material science and product manufacturing information to show categories of products that were refurbished, remarketed, and reintroduced into the economy, and those that were recycled.

“A circular economy commitment helps IT meet business and sustainability goals, while reducing the world’s growing e-waste problem”, comments HPE Financial Services president and CEO Irv Rothman.

A circular economy that is applied to the IT industry can drive more efficient use of products and allow businesses to retire their assets in a secure, compliant, and environmentally-responsible way. HPE’s Technology Renewal Centres (TRCs) in Andover, Massachusetts and Erskine, Scotland help extend the life of technology whenever possible, and securely and responsibly recycle materials where appropriate. In 2018, HPE Technology Renewal Centres processed over 4 million units, including HPE and non-HPE equipment. Of that, 89 per cent was refurbished and resold, and the rest was recycled in a secure and environmentally responsible way.

“Our aspiration is to help customers think about their infrastructure in new ways, build strategies to extend and extract value from what they have, and use retired assets to help fund the transition to new infrastructure,” concludes Rothman.",New Zealand,2018.12

202,Textile waste: Why good intentions are not enough,"Having spent more than 30 years in executive positions in the fashion and retail sector, I was a seemingly very settled retailer, quite happy with my life until an awareness of the issue of textile waste kicked in, and then there was no going back.

Throughout my career I was lucky to have great customers, travel to exciting places and work with incredibly talented people to produce and sell thousands of units of clothing of a broad range of styles to make people look and feel wonderful about themselves.

Yet, as I got older I started to question the sustainability and logic of our industry, and there was a voice growing louder inside of me wondering if I was doing the right thing.

I was participating in a sector that promotes the designing, buying and selling of garments we know will rapidly be marked down, quickly disposed of and ultimately become landfill. Once I understood that, I knew there needed to be change and innovation.

The retail sector is now in a cycle where it is trying to compete with the growth and shift to online shopping and the growth of fast fashion players flooding the market with clothing, which is both low in quality and price.

As I worked with a number of retail charity organisations, I grew more aware of the ever-increasing levels of donations of fast fashion items, which they couldn’t sell because of the sheer volume and poorer quality.
• Australians on average buy 27kg of textiles (clothing, etc) annually.
• We waste on average 23kg of textiles per year per person, second only to the US.
• Australians wear a garment an average of six times before disposing of it – either by putting it in the rubbish or donating it to charity stores.
• Charities are generally only able to sell 15-20 per cent of donated clothing.
• Australia exported 94,000 tonnes of textile waste in 2016-17 and this is growing annually.

I became more engaged and involved in the “circular economy” debate and had the pleasure of meeting many intelligent and well-intentioned people and organisations looking to be a part of the circular economy, a movement to increase the reuse and recycling of raw materials, including textiles, rather than depositing them in landfill.

The challenge facing the retail sector is twofold. Firstly, it needs to continue to engage with a much broader audience than itself and ensure it appeals to all consumers in a practical and meaningful way. Secondly, it needs to present business models which drive real change, supporting the development of the circular economy.

Simply talking about change will not drive it, actions are needed and scale solutions are required.

The recent policy decision by China to no longer accept contaminated waste from Australia has caused an upheaval in the publicly visible areas of waste collection and management, as their traditional market is now effectively shut.

This has caused significant issues at a state level regarding the collection and storage of plastic, glass, and cardboard and significant financial subsidies to help with the recycling of this waste.

Textile waste still has not hit the radar of many governments, even the quality of data of textile waste collected or sent to landfill is not consistently measured by government bodies making policy development and implementation difficult when the scale of problem is not even visible.

The public perception of textile waste is also complicated by our relationship with our clothing. We know plastic does harm if in the ocean, so we recycle plastic bottles without thinking, but we dispose of our textile waste by donating it ‘guilt-free’ to charity stores.

Clothing, just as much as plastic bottles, needs to be reused or recycled into fibres, as charitable donations merely delay landfill, they do not stop it.

There is now technology available in Australia, allowing textiles to be recycled into fibres. For this to happen at scale, we need to see government initially support this process and there to be increased public and consumer awareness of the need to do so. Then there will be real change.

224,Google says ‘circular economy’ needed for data centres,"Speaking at last month’s TEDWomen conference, Google Sustainability Officer Kate Brandt highlighted what she called a ‘circular economy’.

Brandt is referring to how the animals, plants, and microbes of earth are effectively the consummate engineers of this planet, representing a circular system where waste doesn’t exist.

“Think of a tree that grows from the energy of the sun and the nutrients in the soil,” Brandt says.

“Eventually the tree falls and microorganisms, enzymes and bacteria begin to turn the tree back into the soil and nutrients that fuel the growth of new life in the forest. This is the genius of nature, the original circular economy.”

So in terms of what relevance this holds, Brandt believes the same principles can be applied to our modern economy.

“What if, like nature, everything was repurposed, reused and reborn for use again? What if instead of our current linear economy of take-make-waste we had a “circular economy” that mimicked this natural system? These questions aren’t just hypotheticals, they hold the key to our future,” Brandt says.

Earlier this year, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its report that revealed just how dire the environmental situation really is – we have just 12 years to make unprecedented changes to the entire global economy before the damage we have inflicted upon the planet will be irreversible.

Back to Brandt’s circular economy with a strong focus on value creation, a model she asserts could generate US$4.5 trillion of new economic output by 2030.

“We’re already putting this circular approach into practice at Google, and it’s grounded in three principles: design out waste, keep products and materials in use and transition to renewable energy,” Brandt says.

Google currently owns and operates 14 data centres across four continents, with these facilities and the employees within them effectively the ecosystems that fuel Google’s progress.

“And it’s not just Google, it’s Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Baidu and more. Cloud and IT services are not immaterial, they are a growing part of our modern world embodied in millions of data centres. Like all industrial systems, millions of data centres means a significant need for natural resources and an urgency to find a new model for addressing growing demand for energy and materials,” says Brandt.

“Stepping into a data centre feels like the polar opposite of the dirt, decay, and life of the organic world. But it’s still a system—with inputs and outputs, much like the coastal forest of my childhood.”

It’s no secret that data centres consume significant amounts of energy.

“In 2017 Google’s total energy footprint was around 8 million megawatt hours; that’s roughly equivalent to the energy used by the city of Atlanta in one year. And that’s just Google,” Brandt says.

“Data centres worldwide use an estimated 200 terawatt hours each year. That is similar to the national energy consumption of some countries like Australia and roughly one percent of global electricity demand. The other major input into the system is hardware, mostly in the form of thousands of servers ultimately made up of raw materials like tin, gold and cobalt.”

So the question is, how can the circular economy principles apply to modern data centres?

Brandt has listed a few steps Google has implemented thus far:
• Machine learning to optimise the cooling system controls, with data taken from sensors recording temperatures, power, and pump speeds to create an AI-powered efficiency recommendation system. “To date, this has produced a 30 percent reduction in energy use in the cooling system,” Brandt says.
• A transition to renewable energy, with a commitment to match 100 percent of its energy use with renewable purchases. “In 2017, we purchased power from more than three gigawatts of wind and solar projects, more than the amount of energy it takes to power the city of San Francisco for a year,” Brandt says.
• Keep products and materials in use, by designing everything for longevity, repairability, and disassembly for future use. “Today, we use components from old servers to upgrade machines and we build remanufactured machines with refurbished parts. Last year, Google sold more than 2.1 million units that we no longer had use for,” Brandt says.

Companies around the world are on their own journeys towards a circular economy, but it is certainly vital that big players like Google set a precedent.

“We believe global businesses like Google should lead the way in improving people’s lives, while reducing or even eliminating our dependence on raw materials and fossil fuels,” says Brandt.

“Together, I believe we can turn to the work of world’s most efficient engineers and reverse the global challenges created by a take-make-waste economy and create a circular world of abundance.”",New Zealand,2018.12
234,What Remains Amiss in Closing the Loop: Culture in the Circular Economy —,"As the conference room settled, Professor Ali Abbas approached the podium and looked around at the expectant audience. Nametags read universities, near and far; domestic and international research institutions, think tanks, international organizations, local and city councils to state-level authorities, start-ups, associations, consultancies and even chemical and waste management giants such as Dow, Veolia and Suez. Bright minds, officials, and suits all united for one cause: the circular economy. Professor Abbas opened the conference with a seemingly simple task. “Open the folder in front of you and find the palm card, please write down the top three words that come to mind while thinking about circular economy”. Fast forward less than one minute – pens down. The card placed on my folder ominously listed:

My selection was mainly informed by a cursory overview of the circular economy in an Industrial Ecology lecture, every word inching deeper into the fold of the esoteric. The neighbour to my left, a representative from the public sector, had ‘recycling’ at the top of her list; the neighbor to my right, an engineer and PhD candidate, jotted technology as his number one. Circular economy as a concept clearly conjured a broad range of top-of-mind ideas. So, how should one properly conceptualize and define the circular economy? More specifically, what does it mean?—Not just for you and I, but for the world and futurity.

Professor Dianne Wiley, Head of the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Sydney, followed with her opening statement, containing a candid anecdotal view on the circular economy. As circular economy enters policy agendas, as seen in the European Union, or becomes the spotlight in events such as the inaugural Australian Circular Economy Conference, it may seem like a novelty buzzword. Professor Wiley disagreed. Wiley stated that aspects of the circular economy were not new, in fact, they may have been collectively left behind. She recounted the societal modus operandi regarding material items during her childhood using her family’s dealings with clothes as an example. “Clothes were never thrown out. Articles were borrowed and shared among family, friends and the greater community. If outgrown, it was handed down; if torn, it was patched up or repurposed. If virtually unwearable, clothes entered what could be termed ‘the hierarchy of rags’. Clothes would start as cleaning rags and eventually fall to the lower rungs as grease rags. Ultimately, grease rags would be thrown into the bin or incinerated in the backyard.”

Wiley acknowledged the latter was probably not very circular economy-friendly. But what she was emphasising was not the ill-fated end-all of clothes and rags, but the sense of value vested in objects. This notion resonated among conference attendees – at dinner, table conversation was spent sharing tales of days of yore involving material thriftiness – old newspaper used for packaging over bubble-wrap, store-bought food containers reused as Tupperware ad infinitum rather than single-use food trays, the tricks to fixing a television set with a metal coat hanger instead of acquiring a full replacement. Everyone had a story to tell.

Does this mean that our past was an accurate depiction of a circular economy? Was our way of living sustainable at the time? Not exactly. Although these memories stem from more frugal times in the resource-use department, foundations were still built on the traditional ‘take, produce, consume, and throw’ linear economic model.1 Perhaps unknowingly, society practiced what is currently called ‘resource life extending strategies’.2 Resource life extension encapsulates the ‘three R’s’, commonly standing for reduce, reuse, and recycle. However, this concept has evolved to consider more ‘R’s’, including—but not limited to—the following: repurpose, refuse, recover, re-educate, remanufacture, and repair.3 This only represents a small fraction of larger concepts that make up the circular economy. Fellow University of Sydney student and conference attendee, Wynston Lee, published a succinct history and review of the term, which can be read here. Some notions pertaining to the circular economy predate official cognition of sustainable development but are increasingly framed as pieces of the sustainability puzzle.4 However, the reach of a concept implying deep systemic changes can only go as far as its identity congruence and effective implementation.5 Literature suggests that the circular economy, in theory, is still a vastly contested concept and fast approaching a junction that will determine its fate in the role it will play in our common futures.6 7 2 5 Therefore, if the circular economy embodies a crucial process in achieving sustainability, now is the time to explore and smooth out its rough edges to ensure continuity and ubiquity.

As circular economy as a concept remains plastic, multiple points of contention have arisen as opportunities for further research in determining authenticity in promoting sustainability. These potential limits have been identified in six principal areas: thermodynamics, system boundaries, physical scale of the economy, path-dependency and lock-in, governance and management, and, lastly, limits imposed by social and cultural definitions.6 Although the circular economy may face biophysical restraints through system boundaries and thermodynamics, the remaining limiting factors are essentially malleable, man-made elements. In this sense, the world is in “need [of] a broad vision that couples the economy of energetic techniques with the related socio-cultural economy that is induced by, and at the same time reciprocally influences, the mere technical transformations”.8 The previous citation was in reference to matching a clean energy transition to a green economy, but this will probably be required in the transition to a circular economy and could be extrapolated to fit the circumstance. And therein lies the issue: developing the socio-cultural fabric to weave circular economy into place. Despite its growing momentum “the concept of circular economy is still unfamiliar to most people”.9 The lion’s share of research and progress across sectors in the circular economy context has covered “concrete metrics, tools, instruments and computations”, while leaving “assumptions concerning the values, societal structures, cultures, underlying world-views” practically as uncharted territory.6 Nevertheless, studies probing the social dimension of the circular economy are appearing. Research hints at low—but increasing—public awareness, palpable divergences between private sector awareness and behaviour, while the public sector leads in awareness yet presents shortcomings in governmental and institutional synergies for successfully promoting the concept.10 11 12 13 14 Evidence-based research revealed that nuances of culture are key. Cultural barriers saddled circular economy implementation more than anything, especially due to consumer apathy and disregard for cultural sensitivities in production-consumption receptivity.9 10

Looping back to the conference, there were several instances that echoed the dearth of socio-cultural links to the circular economy. This was expressed in different forms, ranging from the excitement in an inaugural conference that opened a platform for discourse, to entrepreneurs vocalizing their concerns in awareness defining technological uptake, to coffee break chats involving several nodding heads agreeing that lack of transversal communication is an inhibiting factor to development. Yet, perhaps this attitude was nudged by Professor Wiley’s opening statements which brought a human touch to the room. It incited thoughtful reflection on attitudes and values. Within the context of complex cluster concepts, it is the density of social factors that separates from new practices to paradigm shifts.6 Perhaps the circular economy is at this crossroads, breaching the paradigm threshold.

After two days of conferencing, just as before, Professor Abbas took the stage, this time with closing remarks and a final request, “Take your palm card, flip to the second side and please write the top three words that come to mind while thinking circular economy, I promise they will be different”. My left and right-side neighbors’ top words—education and cooperation—respectively. My takeaways? Three words starting with the letter c:

And so it seems that without these elements the circular economy may just come full circle rather than materialize a sustainable future.

307,Campaigners head to Parliament calling for Government to support new cash-for-trash scheme,"Environmental campaigners will present a petition to Parliament on Tuesday, calling for the Government introduce a cash-for-trash scheme.

The Kiwi Bottle Drive, a campaign to reduce the number of plastic bottles finding their way into New Zealand's waterways, wants the Government to initiate a bottle-deposit scheme that refunds people when they recycle.
• Recycling won't be enough to save NZ from the plastic plague - report
• Plastic bag found at the bottom of the world's deepest trench
• A complete guide to what you can and can't recycle in New Zealand

A petition organised by the campaigners has received more than 15,000 signatures on website Action Station and will be presented to Parliament on Tuesday.

Campaigner Holly Dove said the scheme not only has proven sustainability results, but could benefit the wider community as well.

""It's getting really amazing recycling results overseas as well as really great litter reduction rates. It also has heaps of cool benefits for the wider community, things like fundraising,"" she said.

""Some people might want to donate their bottles to the local school or the local scouts groups and they can do big fundraisers with them.""

According to the petition, proposed bottle deposits would give people a refund of greater than 10 cents when they recycle a bottle.

Ms Dove said it would easy for the public to get involved.

""How it would work is that you would have places where people can return their beverage containers. So that could be really easy to find spots like at the supermarket,"" she said.

On Monday, a new report found that recycling wouldn't be enough to save Aotearoa from the scourge of unwanted plastic waste even if it's ""radically improved"".

Due to the rise of light, cheap and durable plastic packaging, as well as a lack of proper processes and systems to help with recycling, a global waste and pollution crisis had ensued, according to James Griffin, the head of the Sustainable Business Network's Circular Economy Accelerator (CEA) unit.

The CEA, which published the report, said a circular economy where all materials were reused and nothing was wasted was paramount to moving in the right direction.",New Zealand,2018.12

The top award – the Banksia Gold Award – went to the board of Lord Howe Island, which has taken a “holistic approach” to sustainability. Most notably, the island now has a tourist bed cap of 400 and a waste management facility that diverts 86 of the island’s waste from landfill.

The World Heritage-listed island also has a range of conservation and rehabilitation programs, and claims to have completed the world’s first successful eradication of African big-headed ants.

The award for the most sustainable small business award went to My Green Butler – a “green holiday adviser” that helps persuade visitors of hotels and other accommodation to change their behaviour, such has reducing waste and opening windows to ventilate rooms naturally.

It also sets consumption targets and recommends sustainable activities for guests.

There were two winners of the medium-sized business award: Biopak and GlamCorner. BioPak, a provider of single-use takeaway packaging, won the award for its commitment to the circular economy.

GlamCorner allows people to rent designer dresses to help curb fast fashion culture.

Both Officeworks (in partnership with Greening Australia) and Bank Australia (in partnership with Greening Australia and Trust for Nature) won Banksia awards for large businesses.

Officeworks has been applauded for its Restoring Australia initiative, where two trees are planted for each one used based on the weight of paper-based products purchased at in the stationery stores.

Bank Australia has received recognition for its 10-year strategy for its Bank Australia Conservation Reserve, which seeks to protect and support the reserve’s ecosystem, embed Indigenous land management, revegetate the reserve and deliver value to staff and customers.

Instead, we have to eliminate unnecessary packaging entirely - not just plastic bags - as well as dramatically ramping up reuse and recycle schemes.

""There has been an explosion in the use of plastic packaging in the last 60 years because it is relatively cheap, lightweight and durable,"" said James Griffin, head of the Sustainable Business Network's Circular Economy Accelerator (CEA) unit.

""Unfortunately, systems to properly manage it have not kept pace. This has led to a global waste and pollution crisis, including here in New Zealand.""
• Plastic bag found at the bottom of the world's deepest trench
• Great Pacific Garbage Patch much bigger and deeper than thought

Around 25,000kg of plastic is wasted every day in New Zealand, according to a study published in journal Science in 2015. We're among the world's highest generators of waste.

And the oceans around Aotearoa are the most dangerous in the world for seabirds, according to research presented to Parliament's Environment Committee in July. Worldwide, it's estimated there are more than 5 trillion pieces of plastic in the seas - 92 percent of them microplastics, which are easily consumed by unwitting sea life.

""In a circular economy, the life cycles of materials are maximised, usage optimised and at the end of life, all materials are reutilised so that nothing is wasted,"" the CEA said in a statement.

325,Plastics industry calls for time to restructure itself,"Returnable or compostable coffee cups were just the start of a backlash against non-sustainable plastics.

Faced with a backlash against plastic packaging, the industry that makes it is in a race against time.

Plastics NZ and Packaging NZ have responded to a report by Sustainable Business Network on how the business sector, manufacturers and the Government should approach the country's rising levels of plastic waste.

Its recommendations were for brands and retailers to ""design out"" problematic or unnecessary plastics, increase the amount of recycled content and start innovating packaging that could be re-used.

In a joint statement, Packaging NZ's executive director Sharon Humphreys and Plastics NZ's chief executive Ken Sowman said the industry certainly supported all that.

But the industry was complex. ""The biggest challenge for our industries … is to design systems which meet expectations but still prevent product waste, don't compromise health and hygiene, and that don't put cost pressures on the most vulnerable in our society.

""We must avoid changes which push manufacturing off-shore, putting New Zealand businesses and jobs at risk, especially where it is clear there will be no net benefit socially, environmentally or economically.""

Humphries said the circular plastics economy, where all plastics packaging is collected, reused or recycled, was the ideal.

But the journey to achieve this would require government leadership, both central and local, sector collaboration, new infrastructure and considerable technical innovation.

Society at large would also need to be willing to change. ""We also need to engage society to address consumption and tackle the scourge of litter and illegal dumping which is wreaking havoc on our pristine environment.""

Infometrics economist Brad Olsen said that the plastic packaging industry in New Zealand had about 1,700 workers and 70 businesses that could be affected by the Government's decision to phase out single-use plastic bags.

That was ""a sizable number of workers and businesses who may not able to continue operating"". The six-month lead-in time would be vital for these workers to retool and retrain.

""Plastic bag manufacturing is relatively specialised, meaning workers are unlikely to have highly-transferable skills that they can use to get another job straight away.""

But the ban had would increase demand for non-plastic packaging, and the industry was expecting to need additional workers.

​Infometrics estimates that the wider packaging sector will need almost 12,000 additional workers between now and 2022.

For some manufacturers the shift away from plastics would open doors to produce more sustainable packaging, in materials like cardboard, paper, or even beeswax.

For others, their best option might be something else entirely.

China's decision to ban most imported recycling had meant the price of plastic to recyclers had dropped, and more and more recyclable plastics were headed straight to the landfill.

And consumer attitudes had shifted, so even if a manufacturer's product was recyclable, ""change is upon us one way or another.""

 * The other plastics: Retailers and manufacturers pick up the plastic bag baton

How much are we recycling?

First the bad news: according to a 2016 report, only 14 per cent of the world's plastic packaging is collected for recycling.

That's billions of wasted materials: the study also suggests that 95 per cent of plastic packaging material value is lost to the economy. Our lack of recycling facilities means most of our plastic recycling is shipped overseas.

The buzz phrase in environmental circles these days is the ""circular economy"". This is where materials are used to the max, and at the end of their life, all the components that make them up are reused. It's the opposite to the ""'take, make, waste"" approach which has led to our current problem.

New Zealand has signed up to an international declaration for dealing with plastic packaging by 2025.

It includes getting rid of unnecessary packaging, moving to 100 per cent reusable, recyclable or compostable packaging, and using recycled content by 2025 or earlier.

How do we achieve it?

It won't be easy, but the report outlines three broad plans of attack:

* Simplifying the types and complex formats of plastic packaging

 * More processing facilities in New Zealand

 * Better labelling and consistent collections around the country

Recycling alone won't resolve the situation. The report says businesses using plastic packaging should:

* do an audit to replace problematic single-use packaging or figure out whether it can be reused.

 * redesign their packaging to make recycling easier 

 * support suppliers that do provide packaging with recycled content

Meanwhile, the report says the packaging sector should:

* bring in a national labelling system for recycling, compostable and recycled content

 * expand markets for recycled material

 * expand product stewardship schemes into rigid plastics

Innovation is definitely coming to the fore, with businesses starting offer everything from recycling toothbrushes to re-usable sanitary products.

How about the Government?

Its role is multi-pronged, according to the report. It could:
• start collecting accurate data on plastic packaging

 * urgently develop a strategy to deliver its promises
• increase the landfill waste levy to incentivise change
• invest in onshore recycling facilities
• facilitate common collection and recycling processing nationwide
• use its own procurement policies to help drive changes
• provide R&D funding to establish alternatives to single use plastics

And what can I do about it?

Two things. You can sort the recycling that is taken to ensure that there's nothing contaminating it. Buyers of recycling are much fussier these days.

The other thing you can do is as flex your power as a shopper. Look for products which use less or recycled packaging. Ultimately, the consumer's voice will shout loudest.",New Zealand,2018.12
335,Recycling is not enough to get rid of plastic waste: report,"BYO containers at supermarkets and refillable products like Soda Stream help reduce or remove plastics in the environment.

Recycling alone won't be enough to solve the issues associated with plastic packaging, a new report claims.

The Sustainable Business Network says massive collaboration between businesses and industries is needed if New Zealand is to meet the tight seven-year target it has signed up to in a global plastics packaging agreement.

""There needs to be a wider approach, for example, problematic and unnecessary plastic packaging needs to be identified and eliminated from our supply chains,"" the report's author, James Griffin, says.

Griffin, who is in charge of the network's ""circular economy accelerator"" programme, said plastic packaging had developed deeply entrenched processes over the last 60 years. ""No one entity will be able to transform it on its own""..

According to the report, 40 per cent of oil-based plastic goes into packaging, most of it single-use.

Lightweight and cheap, oil-based plastic has played a fundamental role in protecting food and other goods across long and complex supply chains.

But if trends continue, plastic will account for 20 per cent of the world's oil consumption by 2050.

New Zealand's plastic waste problem had come sharply into focus after China's decision last year to ""effectively close its doors"" to imported recycling, forcing countries to address their rapidly growing mounds of waste.

The report traced the lifespan of packaging at 10 major New Zealand companies including Bluebird Foods, Coca Cola, Countdown, Lewis Road Creamery and New Zealand Post

It makes 47 recommendations including a call for individual businesses to audit the types and amounts of plastic packaging they use.

Ecostore was one of the companies involved, and its managing director Pablo Kraus says it has tried to minimise its footprint by rolling out refill stations so consumers can reuse their containers.

""We're supplying over 60 locations now and hoping to grow that to well over 100 in the next couple of years,"" he said.

""I think one of the biggest challenges we face is changing consumer behaviour.""

The company had also switched to sugar cane-based recyclable containers. The change had cost Ecostore about $1.8 million over four years but the payback would come in reducing its plastics spend over time.

""We see it as doing what's right and on the other side of it we've managed to capture over 5,500 tonnes of carbon from being released into the atmosphere.""

One of the key problems was a lack of information on plastic packaging lifespans, the report said.

""Up -to-date information on the import, production, use, disposal and export of plastic packaging in New Zealand is woefully inadequate.""

Information was important for determining what should happen to different types of packaging.

About 50 per cent of packaging could be recycled, and about a fifth could be reused. But according to some estimates, about 30 per cent of packaging could never be reused or recycled and it would have to be ""designed out"".

Griffin said the global 2025 target was ""an ambitious target, and we need that to arrest the problem that we have"".

""It is feasible to meet, but it needs to be a very significant and sustained amount of innovation and focus and investment.""

The effort required would be almost unprecedented, he said, and it needed the Government, which had been influential in phasing out plastics bags, to provide a holistic plan.

""Companies, for example, have been looking doing it with their suppliers and they've realised they're hitting up against some system issues, so there is this realisation that collaboration is going to be needed to solve this"".

The report also noted that labelling plastics as recyclable was important, but the presence of the code did not mean the item was going to be recycled. That was a matter of location.

And there were other obstacles. Sometimes the price of recycled plastic flakes were higher than virgin resin.

Consumers were also confused about plastic recycling marks meant, and there was no consensus on what deserved to be labelled ""recycled content,"" which risked ""greenwashing"".

And finally, there was the fact that recycled materials couldn't be used forever.

""In reality there are technical limits on the number of times plastic can be mechanically recycled before its functional performance is affected. Further work is required in this area. Chemical recycling may provide the answer.""",New Zealand,2018.12

338,SBN report: Plastic packaging re-think needed | Scoop News,"The first-ever study on NZ’s entire plastic packaging system highlights how even radically improved recycling will not solve all its problems. New Zealanders need to rethink the way we make, use and dispose of plastic packaging.

New Zealand’s Plastic Packaging System – An Initial Circular Economy Diagnosis was prepared by the Sustainable Business Network’s (SBN) Circular Economy Accelerator.

It highlights how everyone has a role to play and no one entity can solve the issues associated with plastic packaging. A co-ordinated circular economy approach is required, which tackles the root causes of the problem not just individual symptoms.

In a circular economy the life cycles of materials are maximised, usage optimised and at the end of life, all materials are reutilised so that nothing is wasted. This presents a viable and prosperous alternative to the dominant linear, ‘take, make, waste’ system.

The study was led by James Griffin of SBN's Circular Economy Accelerator.

“There has been an explosion in the use of plastic packaging in the last 60 years because it is relatively cheap, lightweight and durable. Unfortunately, systems to properly manage it have not kept pace. This has led to a global waste and pollution crisis, including here in New Zealand. More recently, the stresses in our system were highlighted when China effectively closed its doors to the world’s waste.”

The study identifies measures to significantly increase recycling rates such as reduction in the types and formats of plastics used, more on-shore processing facilities, consistent collections around the country, increasing demand for recycled materials and a container deposit scheme.

James cautions that, although such measures offer opportunities to improve the situation, recycling alone cannot solve the issues associated with plastic packaging.

“There needs to be a wider approach, for example, problematic and unnecessary plastic packaging needs to be identified and eliminated from our supply chains. Reuse models need to be adopted and scaled as an alternative to single-use plastics.”

The SBN study drew on global research by the UK's Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF), as well as more than 40 interviews with key stakeholders across NZ’s plastic packaging system. The work was supported by 10 major New Zealand businesses. Many of them have signed up to The New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, developed by EMF and UN Environment. This has 290+ signatories, representing 20% of the world’s plastic packaging production.

The Commitment includes targets for eliminating problematic or unnecessary plastic packaging. It involves moving from single-use to reusable packaging. It aims to stimulate new ways to ensure all packaging can be easily and safely reused, recycled, or composted by 2025. Another goal is to significantly increase the amounts of plastics reused or recycled and made into new packaging. The targets are set to be tightened over time. Participants are required to publish annual progress reports.

The SBN study was partly designed as a foundation piece to help enable participating business to meet these commitments and go beyond them. The report provides 47 recommendations to achieve a new comprehensive nationwide plastic packaging system that works. The top recommendations are as follows:

Individual businesses need to:
• audit the types and amounts of plastic packaging they use. This should find out the types of plastics being used and identify problematic single use plastics
• set bold targets to design out problematic packaging and enable dramatically improved recycling
• support suppliers providing packaging formats with high levels of recycled content

The business sector also needs to work together to:
• expand the market for recycled materials
• develop product stewardship schemes for rigid plastics

And the government needs to:
• develop and implement a comprehensive plastic packaging strategy with bold and ambitious targets

Plastic packaging features significantly in many New Zealand businesses. Adopting a circular economy approach will enable them to address the very real concerns of their customers. It will help them see beyond recycling so they can help prevent unnecessary resource usage, minimise waste and prevent pollution.

339,Work on waste underway | Scoop News,"A new report out today shows that the Government is on the right track to tackle our waste problem, Associate Environment Minister Eugenie Sage says.

The Sustainable Business Network today released its report - New Zealand’s Plastic Packaging System 2018 An Initial Circular Economy Diagnosis.

“SBN’s report is an excellent addition to the public discussion and growing awareness of New Zealand’s waste challenges,” Eugenie Sage said.

“Work is already underway on a number of the recommendations the report identifies for the Government to lead on. This includes work we are doing to collect accurate data, expand the waste levy, and invest in on-shore recycling facilities. The Waste Minimisation Fund is available to support projects to deal with plastic waste including creating packaging alternatives.

“The SBN report highlights the gains from a circular economy approach. I look forward to Government and businesses working together and further constructive initiatives like the report.

“Manufacturers, retailers, the resource recovery sector, councils and consumers all have key roles to play and Government leadership is required. We need a fundamentally different approach where we design waste out of our economic system by adopting a circular economy approach.

“This includes designing products for a long life and which are also easily able to be repaired and renewed, or designing them to be easily ‘unmade’ at the end of their life and their materials recovered and either made into something new, or returned to nature.

“We need manufacturers to be doing much more, faster and manufacturers, retailers and consumers to drive change up the supply chain.

“Earlier this year I announced a work programme to tackle our wider waste issues, which includes expanding the waste disposal levy to all landfills, improving our national data on waste and resource recovery, investing more strategically in infrastructure and innovation to support resource recovery and onshore processing of recovered materials. The Ministry for the Environment is developing a circular economy strategy identifying sectors to target investment.”",New Zealand,2018.12
358,Product longevity keeps facilities sustainable,"The circular economy encompasses many aspects of a businesses that can be changed to improve environmental impacts and create a more profitable business. While creating and highlighting change by promoting that a company uses renewable energy and environmentally friendly materials is one way to show a company cares about sustainability, ensuring the longevity of equipment used in a manufacturing facility can be just as important.

Companies, such as Atlas Copco Compressors, are helping businesses’ equipment last longer, thus saving them money and minimising waste. A McKinsey and Company report, Mapping the Benefits of a Circular Economy, highlighted that the circular economy is a reliable way for industries to increase their profitability while reducing their dependence on natural resources.

McKinsey recognised several potential circular economy activities that could improve performance and reduce costs. These are shifting to renewable energy and materials (regenerate), promoting the sharing of products or otherwise prolonging product life spans through maintenance and design (share), improving product efficiency and removing waste from supply chains (optimise), keeping components and materials in closed loops through remanufacturing and recycling (loop), delivering goods and services virtually (virtualise), and replacing old materials with advanced renewable ones or applying new technologies such as 3-D printing (exchange).

Atlas Copco Australia Compressor Technique business line manager, Jeff Treble, said small changes and replacements can have a positive effect on companies wanting longevity from their products.

“We are maximising the uptime of the compressors for customers by replacing parts under a structured preventative maintenance program. This ensures they have a long life cycle.

“There are components that have a short life time and need to be replaced. A minor component that can be replaced is an easy fix, but if it’s a major component it can cause a major catastrophe,” said Treble.

“Everything can be repaired, but the cost to repair a major component could be more than buying a new machine.” By offering ongoing service and using genuine parts, Atlas Copco helps ensure that products last as long as possible.

Atlas Copco has featured in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index several times – recognising its commitment to being one of the top sustainable companies.

“Environmental aspects are extremely important for Atlas Copco. Sustainable productivity is one of our core values,” said Treble.

He suggested that companies use genuine parts and implement a thorough preventative maintenance plan to help machinery last longer – boosting their circular economy activities.

“There are plenty of pirate manufacturers in the market. The difference is we know those components have been tested with our compressors. The reliability of those components can be affected by quality and design of those materials.

“Using a non-genuine filter can cause disruption to your air flow. There are current components that fail if they are not genuine. They can increase the chance of a pressure drop. For every one bar of pressure drop, you lose seven per cent of energy savings,” said Treble. “That is significant.”

He said working with customers to ensure they have the right equipment and know how to work with that equipment is important. Through research and development (R&D), Atlas Copco Compressors is able to ensure it provides the most efficient products to the market.

“R&D is so important to our customers. We know the life expectancy of the components through all the testing we do.”

The company also implements preventative maintenance plans, which Treble said was a top pritority for Atlas Copco Compressors and it should be at the top of the list for other companies.

“Preventative maintenance servicing is 100 per cent the way that you should ensure longevity. It comes down to making sure the compressor is in the right environment.

“For example, a hot, dusty environment would require more servicing than a cool, clear environment. The better quality the air is, the better quality we can filter the air.”

But, Treble said that even if a compressor is in a dusty environment, such as a mine, there are ways to minimise damage, for instance housing the compressor in a sheltered location.

Smart factories for sustainable future

 Implementing smart solutions for a manufacturing facility also fits within circular economy activities.

Realise Potential founder and industry expert John Broadbent said with smart factories, manufacturers can see what’s going on in their production process, anywhere, anytime. “This helps with recall prevention and eliminates incorrect product being distributed. It means you can notify your customers about any breakdowns that are going to affect production. It improves the efficiency of production so you save money and you can get more capacity out of your existing equipment. The big one I’m seeing at the moment is reduced waste to landfill.”

Broadbent, who is a speaker at the AUSPACK Business and Industry Conference, has more than 40 years’ experience in manufacturing. The last 20 of these have been dedicated to helping businesses of all sizes, use smart factory concepts. He’s seen first-hand the positive change these investments have made, both on profitability, longevity and culture.

By not implementing smart and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, companies can unknowingly be creating a loss and waste in their facilities as their machinery can become outdated.

“I see organisations struggling with equipment they bought overseas that’s not ‘open architecture’, so when they want to become a smart factory they can’t connect to that piece of equipment. They must buy equipment where they can access the source code, because if they can’t extract the information they need, they’re unable to then feed into machine learning or any artificial intelligence platforms,” said Broadbent.

Switching to sustainable materials

 While smart factories and preventive maintenance solutions that help machines last longer are creating more sustainable facilities, companies can implement change by using sustainable materials with a new twist. One academic, who specialises in using biosolids to replace more labour-intensive and unsustainable products in bricks, said companies often steer clear of alternative solutions when they could be seeking help to implement new environmentally friendly materials to their facilities.

RMIT University school of engineering associate professor, Abbas Mohajerani, said companies should think of research collaborations with universities as a chance to improve sustainability processes in their facilities. “I think the manufacturing industry should really continue to make steps to find a solution to environmental issues. They have a big role to play. They have to start seriously contributing to those sustainability goals,” said Mohajerani.

“They should really start to think about values of some of the waste materials.” Mohajerani and his team researched how biosolids can be used to create sustainable products that can be used in factories, for example. The research sought to tackle two environmental issues – the stockpiles of biosolids and the excavation of soil required for brick production.

“More than 3 billion cubic metres of clay soil is dug up each year for the global brickmaking industry, to produce about 1.5 trillion bricks. Using biosolids in bricks could be the solution to these big environmental challenges.

“It’s a practical and sustainable proposal for recycling the biosolids currently stockpiled or going to landfill around the globe,” he said. The research examined the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of fired-clay bricks incorporating different proportions of biosolids, from 10-25 per cent.

The biosolid-enhanced bricks passed compressive strength tests and analysis demonstrated heavy metals are largely trapped within the brick. The research showed brick firing energy demand was cut by up to 48.6 per cent for bricks incorporating 25 per cent biosolids. This is due to the organic content of the biosolids and could considerably reduce the carbon footprint of brick manufacturing companies.

“Most environmental issues are out of sight, out of mind. We are all responsible to think about and meaningfully do whatever we can for restoring natural sustainability to the environment, otherwise we will all be guilty of ignoring the deep, and potentially irreversible, environmental damage we have caused.”

Mohajerani said using biosolids is just one simple solution that manufacturers can consider. “They are much lighter and more porous. They have low thermal connectivity that means less heat transfer.” He said by considering alternative materials when manufacturing products, businesses can save on energy and daily running costs, while reducing their carbon footprint.",Australia,2019.03

The report warns that damage to the planet is so dire that people’s health will be increasingly threatened unless urgent action is taken.

It also highlights the fact that the world has the science, technology and finance it needs to scale up environmental protections and move towards a more sustainable development pathway. However, it reports there is still insufficient support from the public, business and political leaders to take appropriate action.

""The results of GEO-6 are generally pretty depressing, with many ecosystems showing continuing decline since the last global assessment in 2012,"" Professor Baker said.

""GEO-6 makes it very clear that the many stressors we have placed on our environment will impact the livelihoods, health and food security of many of the most vulnerable on this planet, our only home. We can only hope that the science of the GEO will drive future policy decisions.""

Professor Stephens said: ""GEO-6 makes a clarion call for governments to embrace truly transformative policy change if we are to have a chance at meeting the challenges of sustainable development, including maintaining a safe climate.""

Both academics said they were pleased to contribute to this vital work of the United Nation’s environment agency.

Professor Baker, a world-renowned expert in marine science and ocean governance, was the lead author of a chapter in the report – Oceans and Coasts – which examined the human pressures on the health of oceans over the last decade. Commentary on this chapter was also published in The Lancet. She also contributed to a chapter on Oceans and Coastal Policy and a section on circular economy.

361,"Labor to ban plastic bags, microbeads from 2021","Single-use plastic bags and microbeads will be banned across Australia from 2021 if Labor wins the upcoming federal election.

The $290 million plan is designed to protect vulnerable wildlife and reduce the amount of waste dumped into the environment.

""Something like 90 per cent of all sea birds have plastic in them. A third of all the sea turtles around the world are dying from plastic poisoning and consumption,"" Labor leader Bill Shorten told reporters in Melbourne this morning.

If Labor wins government the party will consult with states, territories and industry on how best to introduce the ban.

The European Union has already voted to ban all single-use plastic by 2021.

""If you buy a television set (in Australia), it will be packed with styrofoam,"" Labor's environment spokesman Tony Burke said.

""You buy an almost identical television set in Europe, it will be packed just as safely, but with recyclable material, probably coming from the same factory.""

South Australia, New South Wales, Queensland, the Northern Territory and the ACT have container recycling schemes, but they are not nationally consistent.

Labor will not force other states to set them up.

""We're working on the basis that it's opt-in,"" Mr Burke said.

Instead, the plan will focus on setting up a nationally consistent scheme to separate recycled materials, making it far cheaper to recycle in Australia.

Other planned initiatives include a $60 million national recycling fund, the appointment of a national waste commissioner, and $15 million to help neighbouring countries clean up the Pacific Ocean.

Labor also wants to see 70 per cent of Australia's plastic packages recycled or composted by 2025, but said there had been no pathway to make that happen until now.

Government departments would also be required to purchase recycled products, while the Infrastructure Department will investigate whether recycled products can be used for road bases.

""Australians want action from government to help reduce waste and build a circular economy,"" Mr Shorten said.

Single-use plastic bags and microbeads will be banned across Australia from 2021 under a Labor plan to cut waste.

The move, designed to protect vulnerable wildlife and reduce the amount of waste generated, is part of a planned $290 million spend by Labor aimed at making Australia cleaner for future generations.

“Plastic has a devastating impact on our natural environment — more than a third of the world’s sea turtles were found to have plastic waste in their stomachs, and it is estimated around 90 per cent of seabirds eat plastic waste,” a joint statement from Opposition Leader Bill Shorten, Labor senators Penny Wong and Kim Carr and environment spokesman Tony Burke said today.

If Labor wins government they will consult with states, territories and industry on how best to introduce the ban, which the party said would create consistency after many jurisdictions moved to phase out plastic bags.

Other planned initiatives include a national container deposit scheme, a $60 million national recycling fund, the appointment of a national waste commissioner, and $15 million to help neighbouring countries clean up the Pacific Ocean.

“Australians want action from government to help reduce waste and build a circular economy,” the Opposition’s statement said.

“So while many Australians do their duty — they recycle, compost, use keep cups for their morning coffee — we need the government to take a leading role to tackle some of the big, structural problems.

“For too long the federal government has left issues of recycling, plastics and waste to state governments and local governments.

“Plastics and waste are now becoming both a national and international problem.”

Social media has been set ablaze by the proposed policy, with many supporting the idea of a nationwide ban.

Not everyone thought it was a good idea though, declaring it “not a smart move”.

Some major Australian retailers banned plastic bags last year, initially causing an uproar with shoppers.

But within three months, the country’s two leading supermarkets Coles and Woolworths, saw an 80 per cent drop in the consumption of plastic bags nationwide, according to the National Retail Association.

522,Food scrap power and plastic roads: is this the solution to our waste crisis?,"Food scraps sent to the waste-to-energy plant at Wollert, in Melbourne's north, feed a hungry beast.

The plant owned and run by Yarra Valley Water can process up to 33,000 tonnes of food waste every year, enough to power about 2,000 homes.

The process begins when food waste is delivered from airlines, commercial suppliers and the nearby Melbourne Wholesale Fruit and Vegetable Market.

The waste is scooped up and fed into the mouth of the machinery, where it's chewed into smaller pieces and piped into giant tanks.

""What we're basically doing here is converting food waste to renewable energy using the gas that's produced when you starve the waste of oxygen.""

The gas is burned off to power two turbines, generating enough electricity to power the neighbouring water treatment plant.

About 70 per cent of the power generated is fed back into the grid, and Mr McCafferty says the process creates about a twentieth of the amount of methane that it would in landfill.

""We're planning a second plant ourselves and there's definitely a lot more scope.""

Waste-to-energy is in its infancy in Victoria relative to the rest of the world, but there are about 20 small-scale plants in operation and proposals to build more.

The Yarra Valley Water plant uses an anaerobic digestive model, but others would incinerate or create gas from household rubbish.

China's ban on low-grade recyclables has sent governments and industry scrambling for solutions, and then-environment minister Josh Frydenberg championed waste-to-energy as one option.

But apart from taking several years to build, environment groups are concerned building large-scale waste-to-energy plants would embed a reliance on generating waste as fuel.

Nick Aberle from Environment Victoria said waste-to-energy was a complicated question.

Even a plant relying on food waste has its issues, he says.

""One of the questions that we would have is [is] this actually the best use for our food scraps? We know that organics can be converted into compost which acts as a fertiliser so that is potentially a better option.""

But when it comes to burning household rubbish, Dr Aberle has concerns it would undermine recycling while damaging the environment.

""The more plastic you're burning you're basically running a fossil-fuelled power station which is what we're trying to get away from.""

Waste-to-energy the only operation at scale

The Wyndham City Council, in Melbourne's west, recently agreed on planning permissions for a new waste-to-energy plant at Laverton North that would process 600 tonnes of residual household waste.

The council's director of city operations Stephen Thorpe says it is one of the few that still operates its own waste services and is looking to move away from reliance on landfill.

He recently took part in a tour of waste facilities in Europe, where he saw waste-to-energy in action.

The Victorian Government was developing a policy on waste-to-energy, releasing a discussion paper canvassing the issues.

However it has now been shelved while it develops a broader strategy for reducing waste.

Energy and Environment Minister Lily D'Ambrosio is firm on the issue.

""It cannot undermine a focus on developing up a very strong recycling sector.

""The actual production of energy shouldn't be the goal of a waste-to-energy project, it's an important by-product, absolutely… but the first principle of the waste hierarchy is you encourage people to create less waste.""

""At the end of the day the amount of material going into landfill or waste-to-energy is materials lost, so the more people can do to minimise the amount the better,"" he says.

However he says Victoria should adopt similar policy positions to those in Europe, diverting waste from landfill and taxing what does end up at the tip.

""Because every option that's available as an alternative to landfill [in Australia] is more expensive.""

The Victorian Government is due to finalise a circular economy policy by 2020 — a series of actions to reduce how much waste goes into landfill, encourage recycling and recycling-based manufacturing.

But businesses like Close the Loop in Melbourne's north are already in action.

Close the Loop collects printer toner cartridges and soft plastics, working with construction company Downer to create a road surface built from recyclables.

Close the Loop's Peter Tamblyn says for the circular economy to work, customers need to purchase recycled products.

""We're facing a waste crisis, we've got a solution that is part of the answer to that waste crisis, particularly around soft plastics.

""The challenges are shifting the thinking to innovation, shifting the thinking from just purchasing a road to purchasing a road but also solving a waste crisis… we're not the answer but we're part of the answer.""

Rethinking the use of ""stuff""

According to Jenni Downes from the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology Sydney, the circular economy is about more than recycling.

She points to car share schemes as an example of the principles in action.

She says despite kerbside recycling collections across the country, Australia has not been a big recycler.

""What we think of recycling here in Australia is actually sorting, so we collect material and sort it into different streams and then we look for other people to recycle it and send it off overseas,"" Ms Downes said.

""And that's something that the China ban has really highlighted and made it clear that that's one of the things to progress towards a circular economy that we need to be doing here in Australia is actually using that material in our own products.""

Environment Minister Lily D'Ambrosio says the Government has changed its procurement policies to encourage consumption of recycled products.

She says they have also injected more funds into the recycling sector to help them adjust to China's policy.

""And that is why a circular economy policy will be an all-encompassing set of policies, objectives and actions.""

While the recycling crisis means governments are struggling to cope with plastics in the short term, Ms D'Ambrosio insists it should not undermine confidence in the system.

""Victorians have always wanted to do the right thing by our environment and they are always looking for opportunities to do more. And we encourage Victorians to keep recycling, keep separating out your household rubbish.""

552,CIRCULAR ECONOMY HELD BACK BY HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS,"A circular economy represents a golden opportunity to combine corporate sustainability with profits, but is obstructed by weak chemicals legislations in every part of the world. In many cases, the corporate world is ahead of legislation, and the notion that there is a contradiction between corporate profits and sustainability is becoming increasingly outdated.

This is the key message in a new publication, The Missing Piece – Chemicals in Circular Economy, from ChemSec – the International Chemical Secretariat, an independent non-profit organisation that advocates for substitution of toxic chemicals by safer alternatives.

“Toxic chemicals are very much overlooked in circular economy discussions, but they need to be addressed to make it truly sustainable,” says ChemSec Executive Director Anne-Sofie Bäckar. “Sadly, a large majority of policy makers either do not understand this, or simply don’t care.”

ChemSec’s publication discusses business opportunities in a circular economy, product planning and design, supply chain management, legal compliance, and reuse and recycling. It features five progressive companies – Apple (technology), H&M (fast-fashion clothing), Ikea (furniture and appliances), Coop Denmark (consumer goods) and recycling specialist Sarp Industries – and how they work with chemicals within their business models.

Apple recently announced its goal to one day make its products using only recycled or renewable resources, and has developed disassembly robots that can remove and sort components from up to 200 iPhones per hour, recovering materials that existing techniques such as shredding can’t, at a higher quality.

H&M is developing and implementing a positive list of chemicals to be considered right from the design phase, with the aim of designing garments using only those. Instead of focusing on what not to use, it now focuses on what it should use. The list is publicly available.

Ikea now has 64 per cent renewable and 8 per cent recycled materials in its entire product range, and its aim is to use only renewable or recycled materials by 2030. Its challenge is to find recycled materials from other sources of the right quality and not containing harmful chemicals.

Coop, a member-owned cooperative, applies a stricter approach to chemicals than Danish legislation calls for, and recently ran a petition campaign calling for stricter legislation. Its media activity, campaigning and presence in the public debate actually resemble that of an NGO at times.

On the other hand, Sarp is concerned about politically ambitious recycling goals being set with no concern for what is technically and economically feasible. Focusing on the quantity of materials being recycled and how to increase this, without looking quality of recycled products, just leads to bad practices and cutt¬ing corners.

These case studies illustrate how a growing number of manufacturers and retailers compensate for weak legislation by setting much higher standards of their own. Recently, this positive corporate movement has been on a collision course with legislation that allows for recycled materials with toxic contents.

“More and more companies are interested in recycled materials, but only if they are free from toxic chemicals,” says Bäckar. “Chemicals legislation therefore needs to be set up in a way that actually supports a toxic-free circular economy. That means picking up the pace, banning the use of obviously problematic substances and raising the requirements for chemical transparency in materials.”",Australia,2019.03
704,Kerbside collection reviewed,"The end of plastic rubbish bags and the introduction of a new organic waste collection service in Dunedin might have to wait until at least 2022, the Dunedin City Council says.

The council has, since last year, been reviewing its kerbside collection services as part of its Waste Futures Project.

Options ranged from continuing with the status quo to a host of potential changes, including alternatives to user-pays black rubbish bags and the introduction of a green waste collection service.

Council waste and environmental solutions group manager Chris Henderson said work on a detailed business case should be complete by the middle of the year.

The best options, together with estimated costs, would then be released for public consultation, before the council settled on changes.

However, the size of the possible change meant it would be years before any new service was introduced, he said.

Public consultation was due later this year, but funding then needed to be allocated at next year's long-term plan hearing, he said.

A contractor would also have to be confirmed and time allowed for them to prepare to provide any new services.

Also, depending on the options selected, new facilities might have to be built, he said.

""The earliest we could look to have a new service on the ground would be 2022.

""I would love to get something done sooner; I just don't think it would actually be physically possible.""

Mr Henderson said ""pretty much everything"" remained on the table as options for now, but complaints about black plastic rubbish bags, and calls for a new organics service, were creating ""public pressure"" for change.

Both options were being considered, but questions still to be answered included what exactly a new service would be like, he said.

A new organics service could involve kerbside collection for every home in the city, or drop-off points for people to take their garden waste, he said.

Rubbish bags could be replaced by a bin system, but alternatives would be needed in the central city to avoid clutter, and in some steep hill suburbs, he said.

""That's all the stuff that's going into a detailed business case analysis to try and come up with some good answers to put out for consultation.""

His comments came after reports to councillors last year noted an audit of the Green Island landfill in 2012 had found 26% of all waste was organic.

A subsequent audit of 100 council rubbish bags last year found organic waste comprised 43% of the contents.

The council last year had resolved to explore ways of increasing resource recovery and waste minimisation.

A subsequent Tonkin and Taylor report recommended options to explore in more detail, ranging from promoting greater composting at home, or drop-off points for organic waste, garden waste or both, to a full city-wide kerbside collection service.

The cost of any new service could range from just $10,000 a year to more than $9 million a year, although the ""highly indicative"" figures contained a margin of error of +/- 50%, council staff said.

Work on the Waste Futures Project since then had settled on a move towards a ""circular economy"" as the optimal approach to waste management.

741,Ban on single-use plastic shopping bans takes effect tomorrow across all retailers,"The ban on single-use plastic shopping bags which takes effect tomorrow will cover all retailers.

Associate Environment Minister Eugenie Sage says this is a step towards healthier oceans and giving nature a hand.

""New Zealanders are proud of our country's clean, green reputation and want to help ensure we live up to it. Ending the use of single-use plastic shopping bags helps do that,"" Ms Sage said.

""The ban should ensure less plastic ends up in rivers, streams, storm water systems and the ocean so seabirds, fish, turtles, and marine mammals are less vulnerable to being harmed by it.""

She says banning single-use plastic bags is just one step in tackling New Zealand's waste issues.

""We also need to recharge our materials recovery and recycling systems and shift to a circular economy,"" she says.

Mainstream supermarkets have already made the move away from single-use plastic bags.

According to survey research done for the Ministry for the Environment, New Zealanders have made a rapid transition to reusable bags, with 56 per cent of shoppers in April 2018 bringing reusable bags, increasing to 91 per cent always/often bringing their own reusable bag in September 2018.

""Government regulations and the sum of many individual actions make a difference. New Zealanders remembering to take their reusable bags is stopping tens of millions of single plastic bags becoming waste each year,"" Ms Sage said.

Businesses were given six months ahead of the ban to phase-out single-use plastic bags.",New Zealand,2019.06

It will lead to collapse of fish stocks, water scarcity, soil erosion, air pollution, global deforestation, biodiversity loss and the list goes on. The circular economy is now core policy for a growing number of countries with leadership from Finland, the European Union and Canada, but it is also taking a strong hold in Asia as Japan and China implement circular economic policies to transition them to a sustainable inclusive future. Japan is expected to take this agenda to the G20 meeting it’s hosting later this week. Here in Australia small steps are being taken, spurred on by the waste crisis, Australian cities and state governments like South Australia, NSW and Queensland have started their policy journey. In February, the NSW government released its circular economy policy statement and discussion paper, the South Australian and Victorian governments are developing circular economy policies and action plans, to be finalised next year, and South Australia is implementing its plan. But the Australian government needs to manage the transition with clear policy and targets.

Earlier this month, the World Circular Economy Forum held its third annual meeting in Helsinki

Finland with 2,000 business, government and industry leaders from 90 countries around the world. The theme was Scale It Up because large-scale investment is now required to follow through on this critical market transformation. The EU and countries like Finland have clear targets to meet. Finland will be 100 per cent circular by 2030, it is now in delivery mode. The value of reusing waste needs to be recognised. At the moment circular businesses and services make up just 9 per cent of all economic activity – not a lot, but it is growing fast. The race is on to realise the trillion-dollar value of this new economy. High income countries are leading the way and ensuring the transition is fair and inclusive. People who lose jobs from the old linear economy will need support to reskill and critical investment in Next-Gen circular infrastructure must occur.

Here in Australia we need to move. And the federal government needs to take the lead. Regulatory change is urgent and overdue, our utility and mobility markets need to be opened to new circular solutions. This will require more regulatory action to put a value on previously undervalued outcomes such as reusing waste, preserving drinking water in our dams, or reducing vehicles from the roads. Industry needs to play its part. Capital investment is needed in new local and distributed infrastructure and services. We need local waste collection and sorting systems, water recycling and renewable energy networks, shared mobility infrastructure. We need to get waste classified as a resource and then connect in with countries setting up sustainable reuse infrastructure. But this is not just about waste and recycling - circular economy is an economic solution, and it’s the most powerful one we have.

If we continue to consume resources as we have since the industrial revolution our economy will soon stall, if we want our economy to continue to grow, driving jobs and improving our quality of life, we will need to re-think and embrace a circular economy. The circular economy will grow and develop in ways that are highly profitable. Already new goods and services are emerging from recycling and sharing business models, such as subscription electronics and fashion and shared mobility. New revenue streams are developing as sharing and reuse significantly extends the market value of products, keeping them in the market longer, creating jobs and value. And profits are being made, with the circular economy in Europe estimated at $2.9 trillion by 2030 and $15 trillion in Asia. But to realise these and other benefits we must change our thinking, we simply must take into account the inherent and hidden costs of linear solutions. We need to put a value on natural capital to make a solid economic case not just about our Gross Domestic Product but also to value our resource assets and understand the costs of depletion of natural capital. If we pay attention to these costs and get cost structures right we will make the right decisions – like local waste and water reuse, not transporting long distances or pumping it out to sea. This will reduce costs and bills and help enhance biodiversity and trees, making properties more valuable. And like getting the right foods in the right packaging, to avoid unnecessary waste.",Australia,2019.06
863,Can Australia become the next circular economy superpower?,"As the global economy prepares for 9.8 billion people by 2050, it’s clear our linear economy is reaching the end of its life.

Global economic leaders are now planning for a world circular economy to decouple economic growth from resource use. G20 leaders will hear about the circular economy when they are hosted by Japan – a global circular economy leader – later this month.

It’s no secret our global over-consumption economy will come to the end of its life and we need a Plan B.

Currently, our economy is built on single use “take, make and dispose” principles involving extracting resources, making products, using them once or only a short time, then disposing of them.

A circular economy keeps products and materials in use in the market longer, through sharing, repairing and reusing.

It is about changing the way we produce, assemble, sell and use products to minimise waste and to reduce our environmental impact. It is about valuing our resources, by getting as much use out of products and materials as possible and reducing the amount of waste we generate.

In 2015, the World Resources Forum Asia Pacific held in Sydney estimated the value of a circular economy to Australia could be around AU$26 billion per year by 2025. More work is underway now to quantify the Australian opportunity, but if the European ($AUD2.9 trillion) and China ($AUD15 trillion) opportunities are any indication, it will not be insignificant.

Circular businesses are highly profitable. Sharing and reuse significantly extends the market value of products, keeping them in the market longer, creating jobs, value and multiple new revenue streams.

Australia is already experiencing this transition as new sharing and reuse business models enter the market.

Yet Australia’s infrastructure and services remain wedded to centralised business models that are up to 75 years old, and promote a linear, throwaway and flush-and- forget approach to resources.

This “business as usual” is supported by outdated policy, legislation, regulation and tariff structures.

BAU economic strategy is experiencing its biggest change in centuries. Overconsumption will no longer guarantee our economic success, we need new systems to grow our economy and maintain our high standards of living within the limits of earth’s resource capacity.

To transition will require market reshaping and regulatory, policy and tariff changes that take into account the inherent and hidden costs of linear solutions along with the value of circularity.

Like redefining waste to be a resource, placing a value on removing vehicles from the road, preserving drinking water and reducing fossil dependent fuels.

We also need urgent research and leadership from the federal government and state treasuries to build on the work of the states in embedding circular economy policy into financial policy.

The circular economy will not work as a siloed waste strategy, it needs to be led by federal and state treasuries.

The World Circular Economy Forum held this month in Helsinki is working with the World Economic Forum to scale up the circular economy from the current 10 per cent global economic activity to 100 per cent.

To do it we must all collaborate. The ninety nations attending this year’s event are all committed to action. Among them are four Australian states – South Australia, Victoria, NSW and Queensland.

Our Aussie states are making a great start and with them some visionary councils. However, the circular economy will not progress if it’s a siloed waste policy – it must be an economic policy attached to productivity and jobs growth.

If Australia is to become a circular superpower, urgent research is required by our federal government working with COAG and state treasuries to value and catalyse this transformation before we are left behind.

Transitioning to a circular economy is inevitable, but winning solutions will not be created using old ways of doing things, they really do require change and harnessing innovation, new businesses and private and public sector collaboration.

Australia cannot grow sustainably by taking the same linear approach to infrastructure, products and services it has taken for the past 75 to 100 years. We need some new solutions ASAP.

870,Recycle solar panels and batteries for a healthier planet: Griffith University report,"Australia needs to recycle solar panels and batteries once they reach retirement age in a clean, sustainable way. This will assist in achieving what researchers term, a “circular economy”.

A report by Griffith University researchers from the Gold Coast campus of the Queenland private university says the nation needs to shift from a linear to a circular supply chain to avoid harming humans and the planet.

The report highlights the problems of, and solutions tom the looming chemical ‘stockpile’ which is set to grow as our solar panels and batteries reach the end of their lives.

The research, by Griffith University’s engineering department, was published earlier this year in the Journal of Cleaner Production.

It says Australia faces large volumes of waste as solar products recycle. This is because, like all electronic products, rooftop PV panels and solar batteries contain potentially toxic materials.

Although these are harmless during the products’ lives, recycling solar panels once the product retires requires special attention.

In fact, Australia will have more than 1,500 kilotonnes of retired solar panel waste by 2050 according to the research.

Solar panels have a lifespan of around 20-25 years. This means the first generation of retired panels is already in the system.

However, retired solar batteries will also become a recycling issue in around six years. For example, the Tesla Powerwall 2 comes with a 10-year warranty, so first generation Powerwalls will start to retire around 2025.

The research shows a sustainable supply chain with smart recycling will reduce harm to humans and the environment. It will also limit mining of scarce natural resources to manufacture solar panels and batteries.

This ‘circular economy’ should include everyone involved in making, selling and buying solar panels and batteries, the researchers claim. It can then:
• Reduce the need for new raw materials
• Use renewable energy throughout the process

Researchers say federal and state environment ministers have already agreed to update the National Waste Policy to include circular economy principles.

Australia has little capacity to deal with solar energy waste at present, the researchers claim. Meanwhile, countries like China are refusing to accept overseas solar waste.

Industry, business and consumers also currently have few incentives to recycle solar panels and other waste products.

However, South Australia and the ACT have banned certain e-waste (electronic waste) categories from landfill. Victoria also says no e-waste can enter landfill from July 1 this year.

Meanwhile, Sustainability Victoria wants solar products to be fully included in the Government’s Product Stewardship Act. Those who make, sell and use solar products would therefore share responsibility for their safe disposal.

4,Incorporating circular economy not as easy as it seems | Food & Beverage,"APCO is what is called a co-regulatory body, whose role it is to administer the Australian Packaging Covenant.

“The Australian Packaging Covenant is a regulatory framework that sits under the National Environmental Protection Measure for used packaging. It is very firmly a co-regulatory body,” said Donnelly at a speech she gave at AUSPACK 2019 in Melbourne. “If you think about product stewardship, there are a couple of ways in which you can do that. You can do it in a voluntary sense, which is the industry getting together and deciding to do something. You can do it in a co-regulatory sense, which is industry and government getting together to do something, or you can do it in a mandatory sense, which is the government telling the industry what to do. We’re in what I like to think is the nice place in the middle, where we’re working together and we’ve got a framework to work to.”

The covenant has been going for 20 years, and every five years a new strategic plan is put in place that is agreed between industry and government together. In 2016, both industry and government got together to begin looking at a new approach. The covenant had been around for quite some time and it was struggling to find a way to deliver effectively to industry and government on the packaging changes that needed to happen. Government and industry looked at what model could be applied – looking particularly at the circular economy.

“We had a mandate in the 2017 strategic plan to deliver the sustainable packaging pathways in Australia through a circular economy model, which is no small feat,” said Donnelly. “It’s wonderful to talk about circular economy conceptually, but it is quite difficult to deliver in an operational sense, because it does require a complete transformation of the entire packaging ecosystem. That requires a level of collaboration and is driven through a collective impact model, which is all about shared value. If one of us doesn’t get there, none of us get there – that means you’ve got to take everybody on that journey with you. When you have 1,500 organisations and eight different governments (including states, territories and federal), that’s quite the challenge. So a co-regulatory body has a big task in terms of bringing stakeholders along the journey and getting everybody to where they need to be to be effective in this space.”

They focussed on four key areas. One is helping with the Sustainable Packaging Guidelines (SPG), which APCO has reviewed, with the end result being a new version of the SPG due out at the end of 2019. They are also at the forefront of providing a prep tool, which is a packaging recyclability portal, that is available to all APCO members, giving them the ability to actually know that they are designing packaging that has the ability to be recycled.

 The second area APCO focussed on helping businesses identify and develop operational systems required for this work. Some of the key resources in this area are about strategic partnerships – bringing together organisations that otherwise would have no alignment with each other, other than that they have a similar end of life material.

“For example, we have 1,500 organisations that represent 153 different ANSZIC codes,” she said. “And if you can end up with an airline, a homewares company, a retailer and a pharmaceutical who, in any other sense, would probably not be having conversations – but who all have a similar material that they may need to deal with at end of life – that gives you the ability, in terms of looking at programs and options going forward, of scaling up material volumes and models that previously may not have been economically or operationally viable. That is because the limited scope of the material available can actually be scaled up on that collective impact model.”

The third area is education. The Australasian Recycling Label is the flagship piece of work for APCO in terms of helping industry and governments to communicate with consumers/communities about packaging and how to deal with packaging at end of life.

 Finally, the fourth area is about material circularity. There’s no point recycling a piece of packaging unless it has a home to go to that has a value, said Donnelly. Material circularity is about dealing with the end market and creating a sustainable ecosystem for post-consumer recyclables.

Donnelly also touched on China’s national sword policy that reduced the amount of impurities it would allow in recycled materials coming from countries like Australia. And this, said Donnelly, is where Australian food, beverage and other industries that rely on packaging need a change in mindset.

China’s new policy saw the value of recycled materials drop through the floor. What this did was highlight the economic impact of the decision within Australia and whether it was palatable to have that level of risk on the global market for a commodity item such as waste.

“After much conversation among industry and government, it became obvious that that level of risk was not palatable,” said Donnelly. “So what’s our alternative? Our alternative is that we must create a domestic market and domestic opportunities for those materials to be used. Here there is a big transformation that’s required. APCO did a report that is available on our website, and that was completed around the time the China national sword policy was announced. That was one of the key things that really drove the need to do something different to what we’ve been doing traditionally. That coupled with the sustainable development goals and consumers’ greater awareness coming from things like ‘The War on Waste’, really drove a need to take a very different approach.”

In April 2018, APCO met with the state and federal environment ministers to discuss how APCO could support the response to these issues. Initially, the organisation went through a series of ways it could do that and it also tried to look how it could reach a target that could enable it to have something for companies to work towards.

“It was at that point that the 100 per cent target with regard to packaging being reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025 was endorsed by every government in Australia, including federal,” said Donnelly. “We then went away and, in coordination with industry and government, we sat down and spent about six months working through what other targets and what other areas needed to be addressed to support such an audacious target. There were a range of targets that were discussed, but the consensus and the agreement in the end was around three other sub-targets that support that 100 per cent target. We talked about 70 per cent of plastic packaging being recycled or composted.”

Another target was 30 per cent average recycled content across all packaging.

“This is very much about driving the pull,” she said. “We need a pull in the market to give a home to these materials, and there’s no home if the home doesn’t have a value. Looking at recycled content is about understanding how we can get recycled content into certain material. And this is not a ‘purist version’ of bottle to bottle, this is about finding a home for materials that can be recycled across a range of activities. This conversation is very open about what the solution can be.

“You’ll note that the target is an average recycled content, and that is because recycled content can’t go into all packaging. There are some things that it can’t go into and that is really challenging – things like pharmaceuticals, some food products – and if you’re looking at a 30 per cent recycled content target, really the focus area is about looking, initially, at your tertiary packaging and your secondary packaging. And primary packaging is something that we can look at, but not where we would be suggesting to start from a strategic viewpoint.”

The final target APCO mentioned was phasing out problematic and unnecessary single-use plastic packaging through re-design, innovation or alternative delivery methods.

“This is a big, contentious area,” said Donnelly. “This is the whole space where people are talking about plastic-free and all these kinds of things. What’s bubbling up from this is a need to recognise that there are some packaging materials where we just shouldn’t use single-use plastics. But here’s the thing – if you’re not going to do that, you need to have a plan on what your alternative is. There’s no point in banning straws or balloons, and that’s what we’ve seen recently. Some councils have come out and banned things like straws and then they’ve had an issue with the disability sector, where some people need straws to consume food. We need to be working through alternative models and planned pathway for transitioning away from these materials.

“It’s not that you shouldn’t transition away from things. There are going to be some materials that are just simply too hard to recover, or not recoverable, which we can use alternative materials for, but we need to do the work and planning for what those things will be, and for that transition pathway.

“You’ll see some news pieces around people and certain industry sectors pushing back and saying we should mandate recycled content. Well, we’ve got to agree on what recycled content is first. In this space right now, we are in a very big transition and it’s a transition that needs to be done in a considered way. It is about making sure that we have the best possible outputs and outcomes in a considered way so that we don’t drive perverse outcomes.”",Australia,2019.06

141,How Your Old Jeans Could Become Someone's Prosthetic Knee,"Your jeans could be re-purposed and sold as part of someone's prosthetic knee.

An Australian designed solution to textile waste means old clothing can be converted into almost anything -- and engineers are getting closer to getting it on shop shelves.

It's a bid to help reduce the growing amount of fast-fashion waste.

The fast-fashion industry contributed to an increase in the amount of textile waste going to landfill. In fact, 500,000 tonnes of waste from the textile industry goes to landfill each year.

A whopping 20 percent of all freshwater pollution is a result of textile treatment and dying. Dying is also a resource-heavy process that uses a plethora of human and natural resources.

But technology developed by Australia's own Institute Frontier Materials at Deakin University has developed a way to repurpose natural, dyed or blended fibres into anything, even a prosthetic knee.

The process sees fabrics broken down to their basic chemical form.

""We started with denim, it's a common fashion item, everyone can relate to it and it's easy to explain,"" Dr Nolene Byrne Associate Professor from Deakin's leading circular economy group, Institute for Technology Research and Innovation told 10 daily.

Researchers access the cellulose bio-polymer -- an abundant, versatile and strong carbohydrate that comes predominantly from trees and has many industrial uses. Cellulose is used to make everything from paper to cellophane, industrial gels, and acetates.

Cotton is also 90 percent cellulose. This is significant because an old cotton garment, like a t-shirt or a pair of jeans, could be recycled to make an entirely new object.

""There is a pulping process, where you remove the ligaments and other components from trees and what you are left with is wood pulp and a high purity cellulose material.

""You can make many products from wood pulp from recycled products so that's where are we going with the synthetic knees,"" she said.

While the cotton recycling process is the closest to being adopted by the industry, similar processes for blended and synthetic textiles are also being developed.

The Institute's system means textile colours and dyes can be reused, making the new process significantly more environmentally friendly than what currently exists.

""When we look at places recycling, there are ways to recycle plastics. The amount of [textile] waste that is generated and continues to be generated on the scale that it is with the population growth, there has to be chemical textile recycling,"" Byrne said.

Bryne also said the new research essentially provides a circular economy-style option for the textile industry, where clothing items can be recreated and repurposed instead of going to landfill.

READ MORE: I Had The Bottle To Go Without Plastic For A Week. Here's What Happened.

""We wanted our technology to be a closed loop and we wanted the solvent system, or the chemicals, to be eco-friendly and sustainable ... as well as economical as possible,"" Byrne said.

A circular economy is much more than traditional recycling.

It's an alternative to the current 'take, make, throwaway' approach to products. It tries to refocus consumer and manufacturer thinking to a 'take, make and recreate' system.

""One of the main principles is trying to get rid of the concept of waste because if you think about it, what is waste?"" Research Director at the Centre for Business and Social Innovation at the University Of Technology, Sydney Melissa Edwards told 10 daily.

""Waste is just something that we have decided is a resource that doesn't have value anymore but actually, all resources and all materials have value it's just about how we use them.""

But if those items are to keep their value, they have to be kept in use for longer. Byrne's research is an example of this, where a used item of fabric is repurposed into another garment or a completely different object, thus giving it further value.

Edwards said both consumers and manufacturers don't have to ""give up everything"" they are used to, but change their mindset about how items are made and disposed of.

""We want disposability, people want convenience ... and that helps us think differently about product design,"" she said.

""If I have a completely biodegradable package that goes back into the earth and enhances the soil ... and if that package has been produced using renewable energy sources does it matter if am consuming that and then disposing it?""",Australia,2019.06
153,Bold ideas to transform New Zealand,"Stuff asked: What are the biggest, boldest ideas to transform New Zealand?

With our rich natural, cultural and intellectual capital New Zealand could make some truly bold changes, and perhaps lead the world by example – if we dare.

Stuff asked a range of Kiwi businesspeople, thought leaders and cultural ambassadors what their one big idea would be to transform New Zealand.

High on the agenda for many was increasing protections for the environment and moving to a more sustainable, green, economy.

Others want to shake up our electoral system, invest in technology and education and grow capital markets to take the country forward.

I want to give natural sites personhood. Why? We already give legal personhood to corporates, and they aren't even alive.

Nature is declining at rates unprecedented in human history. Several iwi have had their natural sites of significance recognised as living beings, with the legal rights of personhood as a way to protect them and recognise the deep and intergenerational connection they have.

My idea for transformation is to provide quality professional development to all teachers across all levels.

From 2020, all schools across New Zealand will adopt the new digital technologies curriculum. This significant move is a response to our society entering a digital era, where digital skills – development of technology or computational thinking – are as necessary as reading, writing, and numeracy.

Henri Eliot, founder of Board Dynamics and author of Board Shorts

We need to build on New Zealand's outstanding pool of internationally recognised artificial intelligence (AI) expertise by training, attracting and retaining more top researchers who want to lead the world in machine learning and deep learning research. This could involve creating a not-for-profit institute dedicated to research in the field of AI, excelling in machine and deep learning.

Grace Stratton, founder of All is for All

When the experience of mainstream fashion is made accessible, we can transform New Zealand.

Fashion is the nucleus of cultural relevance, it speaks to self-agency and confidence.

By reflecting and empowering people with disabilities in mainstream fashion we can spark wider change. Through design we can build a barrier-free society.

We need to get tough about cleaning up the environment. We should implement a user pays system for visiting New Zealand, and with the money, give a better experience.

Install more public toilets and maintain them well, and manage rubbish disposal better. Impose steep fines for breaches: $20,000 for soiling, $5000 for littering, and set up a website for reporting.

Fine companies renting campervans without toilets, and those that give discounts for toilets returned unused. Issue permits for a fee to 'freedom camp'. No permit; automatic $1000 fine.

Sir John Key, former prime minister and chairman of ANZ New Zealand

If we are to make the waka go faster we need to invest heavily in infrastructure right now – even if the cost is high.

Work on an alternative harbour crossing in Auckland, high-speed rail to Hamilton and a four-lane highway to Whangarei would all allow investment to pour in and productivity to rise.

My big idea is to change the distribution of power to 75 electorates made up of 25 children's, 25 Māori, and 25 general electorate seats, and 45 list seats.

Enfranchising children and empowering Māori will shock the entrenched power structures that perpetuate the business-as-usual status quo. This upheaval in the balance of power is needed to transform decision-making processes to longer-term perspectives.

Francis Valintine, founder of The Mind Lab and Tech Futures Lab

New Zealand needs to dramatically increase our population of experts.

Through opening our border to engineers, scientists, technologists, investors and researchers, we will generate friction, debate and new capability, encouraging higher levels of innovation.

In turn, we can become a world leader in contemporary industries supporting a dynamic and evolving economy.

Our current model of agriculture is a battle to control nature.

Foundational advances in microbiology and plant physiology have occurred since the 1980's, but has yet to be applied to food production.

The new understanding is of a complex, cooperative natural system that relies on microbial diversity. By tweaking our fertilisation, planting and grazing practices, we can quickly achieve massive environmental health benefits.

Tahlia and Semisi Hutchison, founders of Little and Brave Eco Nappies

Make landfills a thing of the past. Significantly reducing landfills will kick-start innovation across a range of industries from product and packaging design, to resource and waste management, to home, community and commercial composting.

With strategic legislation, infrastructure investment, and incentives for innovators, we can build the public-private partnerships needed to create a circular economy for our country.

New Zealand needs to get closer to China. Sometime soon, China will have the biggest economy the world has seen. If we're to be anything other than a bit player in a China-led economy, we need to grow our existing cultural, economic and political ties, fast.

We're not starting from scratch: our history with China goes back to the 1800s, 150 years on, it's time to give back.

China is filled with optimistic people hungry for a better future.

We must lift the capability of all New Zealanders, especially those who are struggling. If we, through government agencies, keep developing programmes the way we have always done we are going to keep getting the results we've always got.

Communities need to be engaged with, and deeply involved in, the design and implementation of the solutions to poor health care and poor housing situations. We need to support what's already working at the grassroots level.

For example, programmes like Kootuitui Ki Papakura – education, health services, warm, dry, healthy homes.

Jeremy Moon, founder of Icebreaker Clothing, chairman of Better by Design and business mentor

The minimum wage has increased to a fair level, the focus should now be on increasing the average wage. One way to achieve this is to create more high value jobs, through creating more international businesses from New Zealand.

It's not just about kiwis selling more stuff to each other – it's about New Zealanders running businesses that extend the borders of our economy internationally.

They should be encouraged with more support and funding, and ultimately be celebrated for their courageous journeys into the unknown.

Aotearoa New Zealand should convert all its dairy, sheep, beef and horticulture to a regenerative form of agriculture that restores and enhances the mauri of the land, rivers, air, kai and improves sequestration of carbon, resilience and profitability.

Pine forests and other retired farming lands could be converted to permanent and harvestable native forests increasing the value of our eco-tourism industry providing meaningful work, as every tree planted helps save many threatened taonga species of birds, insects and plants.

My big idea is to change to accounting and tax law, requiring environmental costs to be accounted for and paid into direct environmental taxes.

Putting the cost of pollution inside the cost of production makes the cost of pollution inherent in the cost of the product. This change of thinking can apply to all products, not just of agricultural production but for petrol, plastics, packaging, tobacco and alcohol.

The retailer or the processing facility can choose to buy the cheapest products however that would come with fees allocated to be paid into environmental funds. So if a company used environmentally friendly ingredients or materials, these fees would not be paid.

Nothing like fees and responsibility at the board table to encourage change.

Start acknowledging the importance of vulnerability as a leadership capability to create business growth through culture change.

Vulnerability is described by Brené Brown as being the ""core, the heart, the centre of meaningful human experiences,"" so it's about time the era of 'hardening up' in the workplace and leaving your 'baggage' at the door comes to an end.

If Kiwi leaders stood up, embraced vulnerability and focused more on creating business cultures steeped in wellbeing and belonging, I think we would see a very different environment to what we have now.

Taste is never corrupted by simplicity. Regenerative farmers focusing on soil health and function are demonstrating pathways to reduce irrigation, synthetic chemicals, and antibiotics by tapping into ecological processes.

For them it's intuitively better because it's simpler. Globally farmers using these techniques create healthier landscapes, grow produce with few toxic residues, lift profits, improve farmer mental health, generate better marketing stories, and store carbon in soil.

Allbirds announced that its entire business, end-to-end, is going carbon neutral beginning this year.

Climate change, and by association sustainability, is the problem of our generation and solving it is not just the right thing to do, it is good business.

It seems clear to me that the nations preparing to transform to inclusive green economies will be the winners over time. Based as I am now in the United Sates, in a country that hasn't yet reached consensus on the problem itself, I don't think we should underestimate the opportunity this represents.

Imagine a future where you pay only for the use of the goods you need, and manufacturers retain ownership of the raw materials.

Globally, consumers spend US$40 trillion (NZ$61t) a year. What do we have to show for it? Homes stuffed with raw materials – plastics, metals, paper, textiles – that we no longer use and don't know what to do with.

Brands shift to selling services, not goods, and designers design for quality, disassembly and repairabilty.

Let's fund 10 new venture capital funds with at least $100 million each. Let's have all the Kiwisaver funds and the Super Fund allocate 4 per cent to growing companies in New Zealand.

Let's stir up the stockbrokers to get to know the new companies and find the good ones for us. Let's tell the brokers that we want to invest in the Rocketlabs and Lanzatechs being built – making us proud owners of the great new companies being built from New Zealand.",New Zealand,2019.06

218,Environment Department Statements,"Queensland, and the rest of Australia, are fighting a war on waste.

The decision of China and Malaysia has revealed how exposed Australia’s waste management system is, and how reliant we are on off-shore processors and markets.

The Queensland Government is modernising waste management. We have set a path forward for Queensland to help grow the recycling and resource recovery industry.

At the moment, Queensland is generating waste faster than it is growing in population. We also only recycle about 45% of our waste.

We know this needs to change, and that is why the Government is investing in a range of measures to decrease waste and improve recycling rates.

Last year, we introduced a ban on single-use plastic bags. Since then, we have seen a 70% drop in plastic bag litter.

Last year we also implemented the container refund scheme, where Queenslanders can get a 10-cent refund for recycling their drink containers.

Since it was implemented on November 1, more than 700 million containers have been returned across Queensland, and we’ve also seen a 35% reduction of containers ending up as litter.

Last month the Queensland Government implemented a waste levy. Queensland used to be the only mainland state in Australia without a levy, and we have now been brought in line with the rest of the country.

Revenue from the levy will help fund critical infrastructure and help grow recycling and waste industries, and ultimately create a market in Queensland where we can recycle more of our waste.

There are huge economic opportunities in recycling, including the ability to create more jobs. For every 10,000 tonnes of waste sent to landfill, less than three jobs are supported. But if that same waste was recycled, this would support more than nine jobs.

In July 2019 the Queensland Government released a new Waste Management and Resource Recovery Strategy to help Queensland move towards a “circular economy”. This Strategy has also set long-term targets, including, by 2050:
• 10% of all waste going to landfill

These targets are expected to create 3000 jobs in the waste and recycling industry within a decade.

The NSW Government supports COAG’s decision to develop a timetable to ban the export of waste products while building our capacity to generate high value products.

NSW is working on a 20 Year Waste Strategy and a comprehensive plan to tackle plastics which will complement the COAG work.

The NSW Government’s commitment of more than $800 million for waste and recycling initiatives under the Waste Less, Recycle More program, is the nation’s largest recycling program. It’s through this initiative that Roads and Maritime Services have completed successful trials of using recycled glass in our roads. I’m thrilled to say it’s been so successful they have now increased the allowable amount of recycled crushed glass to be used in road base, from 2.5% to 10%. Initiatives like this is how we’re developing new uses for recycled material.

The waste levy aims to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill and promote recycling. Since its introduction, recycling has increased. The NSW Government apportions revenue from the waste levy across a number of public services. One third of the waste levy is used to fund environmental programs, such as the Waste Less, Recycle More initiative. The remaining two thirds fund essential government services, such as schools, hospitals and roads.

My Commonwealth and State colleagues have a target of 100% of Australian packaging being recyclable, compostable or reusable by 2025.

Managing our waste is one of our major environmental challenges and the NSW Government is committed to delivering a better, cleaner environment in NSW for future generations.

The Victorian government is working closely with industry, local governments and the community to address current disruptions to recycling systems and ensure as much recycling as possible is processed.

We’re also working on a range of longer-term strategies and initiatives to increase domestic processing, ensure less contamination and reduce the amount of waste produced in the first place.

We have built a strong foundation for Victoria’s transitioning waste industry, through record funding of more than $135 million over the last four years in the waste and resource recovery sector. This includes $37 million to deliver the Recycling Industry Strategic Plan and the recently announced $34.9 million for more recycling support measures.

The Recycling Industry Strategic Plan is about the long-term transition of the sector that will help create the extra recycling capacity that Victoria needs to be ready for any future disruptions.

Victoria has led the way in modernising the waste industry, as the first Australian jurisdiction to have in place a comprehensive, long-term waste and resource recovery infrastructure planning framework.

Victoria is also developing a circular economy policy that will build on our strong record of continuously improving our waste management and resource recovery capabilities.

The policy will identify new ways for Victorian businesses and communities to use materials more efficiently and avoid waste in all stages of making, using and disposing of the products and infrastructure we rely on every day. Victoria’s infrastructure projects are already benefitting from a truly circular economy with trains travelling through Richmond are now running on railway sleepers made from recycled plastic.

Over the past four years, the Victorian Government has been delivering a comprehensive suite of waste and resource recovery initiatives to develop and grow a sustainable resource recovery network for all Victorians and build the state’s capacity to respond to the shifting global trends including:

In addition, the Victorian Government is identifying opportunities to incorporate recycled content into its procurement activity, which will further drive demand and build domestic markets for recycled materials.

These strategies have established Victoria as a national leader in building markets for recovered resources, fast tracking the state’s shift to a more circular economy.
• Victoria is leading the way in developing a circular economy policy that will build on our strong record of continuously improving our waste management and resource recovery capabilities.
• We are working with experts from across industry and engaging with local governments and communities across the state.
• This is about investing in ways to turn waste and recycled products into valuable materials, and we’re making sure we get it right.
• This means taking a ‘borrow-use-return’ approach, where things are re-used, repaired or recycled rather than going to landfill.
• The circular economy will deliver better environmental, social and economic results for Victoria.
• We are supporting the Victorian recycling sector so we can make more from our recycling.
• The Victorian Government has provided $19.1 million to 60 infrastructure projects in metropolitan and regional Victoria through the Resource Recovery Infrastructure Fund since 2017.
• These projects are expected to create more than 400 jobs in Victoria’s waste and resource recovery sector and divert at least 900,000 tonnes of material from landfill each year.
• Victoria is getting on with transforming the state’s recycling industry, working with local government on a major overhaul of kerbside collection, that will seek innovative and cost-effective designs that could include additional household bins to reduce waste contamination.
• This may include extra bins for households to improve the separation of waste, making it easier to recycle materials.
• Everyone has a role to play in reducing the amount of waste that goes to landfill, including businesses and householders.
• We’re investing in recycling infrastructure to create a more stable and productive recycling industry.
• Victoria is now home to a new state-of-the-art plastics recycling plant in Melbourne’s north that is set to process 70,000 tonnes of plastic each year - equivalent to almost half of all plastics currently recovered across the state. This project was supported by the $26.1 million Resource Recovery Infrastructure Fund.
• For every kilometre of railway track installed with sleepers which are made from 85% plastic waste, 64 tonnes of plastic waste that would have otherwise gone to landfill is recycled.
• Four million glass bottles per day are processed into 800 tonnes of construction sand to be used in Big Build construction projects.
• For every 300 metres of recycled green roads, we use 530,000 plastic bags, 168 glass bottles 12,500 used printer cartridges and 134 tonnes of reclaimed road asphalt.
• The Metropolitan Waste and Resource Recovery Group (MWRRG) has led and continues to deliver the organics network that processes Melbourne’s green and, increasingly, food waste. The capacity of the organics processing network now exceeds the Metropolitan Waste and Resource Recovery Implementation Plan 2021 target by 120,000 tonnes.
• In 2014, Moira Shire introduced a kerbside food and green waste collection service. The strength of the partnership between the council, the regional waste and resource recovery group, the collection contractor and the organics processor has seen the service achieve one of the lowest contamination rates in the state, at less than 0.3 per cent.
• We have banned e-waste from Victoria’s landfill
• To support the rollout of the ban we have invested $16.5 million to upgrade e-waste collection and storage facilities across the state, and develop an e-waste education and awareness campaign.
• The e-waste ban reduces the need to extract raw materials from the earth.
• A consistent three bin kerbside collection system, which includes separation of food organics and garden organics from other waste categories, to be provided by all local governments in the Perth and Peel region by 2025 and supported by State Government through the application of financial mechanisms.
• Implement local government waste plans, which align local government waste planning processes with the Waste Avoidance and Resource Recovery Strategy 2030.
• Implement sustainable government procurement practices that encourage greater use of recycled products and support local market development.
• Provide funding to promote the recovery of more value and resources from waste with an emphasis on focus materials.
• Review the scope and application of the waste levy to ensure it meets the objectives of Waste Avoidance and Resource Recovery Strategy 2030 and establish a schedule of future waste levy rates with the initial schedule providing a minimum five year horizon.
• Develop state-wide communications to support consistent messaging on waste avoidance, resource recovery and appropriate waste disposal behaviours.
• Review and update data collection and reporting systems to allow waste generation, recovery and disposal performance to be assessed in a timely manner.
• Undertake a strategic review of Western Australia’s waste infrastructure (including landfills) by 2020 to guide future infrastructure development.

It’s important not to over-simplify what China’s National Sword Policy is and does. China still accept (and actually pay a premium for) processed and sorted plastic waste. What China did was to stop accepting mixed materials, or materials that were considered too dirty to be easily reprocessed. That’s not the same as China just not taking any materials back. Often the outcome is the same interstate where the sorting and recovery process is not as advanced as it is in South Australia. In South Australia, beverage containers have a ten cent deposit on them. SA has had this for 42 years, since 1977. This means SA has deeply ingrained cultural behaviours the rest of the country just doesn’t have when it comes to recycling and recovery. We also have deeply embedded infrastructure: All South Aussies know where the local ‘bottle depot’ is in their neighbourhood. These are institutions in SA as are the characters who work at them. At these depots plastic and glass is sorted into various colour streams: clear, green, and amber. This is a very important distinction because that simple process of sorting our waste makes the material much, much more valuable and easier to sell. Amber glass can’t be made ‘clear’. So the wine industry here – which consumes almost all the recycled glass – pays a premium for pre-sorted glass.

The same is true of plastics: with black plastic being the least sought after because it can’t be tinted or coloured back into another colour like white or clear. But since China’s National Sword Policy, South Australia has invested considerably in better, smarter, and faster systems to not only sort waste plastic, but to process it into a raw material (plastic ‘pellets’) that China actually pay a premium for. This is effectively a way in SA to move to a more circular economy and turn what was a waste product into a raw material or resource – one that China will happily accept.

Local processors Recycled Plastics Australia (RPA) received a loan from the South Australian Government to ‘tool up’ and fit out a factory with state of the art kit to turn not just South Australia’s waste plastic, but waste plastic from around the country into an export quality raw material (pelletised plastic). The main market for this material is China. So It’s important to understand that SA has pivoted quickly to respond to the challenge. Funding from the South Australian Government to address the impact of the National Sword policy in SA has been in place since May 2018. So while we welcome recent announcements by Prime Minister Scott Morrison on plans to stop exporting any recyclable materials or waste, it’s something SA has been heading towards well ahead of the rest of the country – as usual.

When funding was announced in 2018 by the South Australian Government to invest 12m in responding to National Sword, one of the most important aspects of this funding was to spend time and effort on researching householder attitudes towards recycling to understand barriers, challenges and values around how and why people recycle, and to develop a single, consistent statewide message on recycling. This led to the creation of the Which Bin campaign (www.WhichBin.sa.gov.au, www.facebook.com/whichbin and http://bit.ly/whichbinads). These commercials were the first time that SA had seen prime time advertising on how and why to recycle. Including a print media campaign, outdoor advertising, social media support and a dedicated Which Bin hotline, The South Australian Government is on the front foot in showing its commitment to improving the quality of recycling and to diverting as much as possible from landfill. No other state has yet adopted the ‘Which Bin? Just Ask Vin’ messaging, or committed to a prime time, traditional TV advertising campaign to get into people’s homes, and their hearts and minds to improve their bin behaviour and increase recycling knowledge and know-how at the kerbside level.

South Australia diverts 83.6 % of all waste from landfill. This is a world leading result. But ‘waste’ production is on the increase. Make no mistake – we are all creating more waste. Through consumption, packaging and our general attitude towards disposable, single use or short term consumer items, waste is on the increase, not the decline. In one respect this makes SA’s result all the more impressive, because even with more waste being generated, we still managed a slight reduction from landfill last year.

Questions about how much waste and what we recycle are all quickly available in the SA Recycling Activity report here:

Businesses in SA are also actively seeking to move towards a more circular economy to not only avoid waste but to develop new markets for recycled content product. We strongly recommend watching some of these videos that showcase just how diverse and world leading some of the ideas out of South Australia – they are eye openers to most people:

Turning waste plastic and waste timber into valuable products for export

A prime example of the circular economy in action in South Australia. Local company Bio Gro provides wood residue to Holla-Fresh at no cost, for use as a heating fuel. Afterwards, Bio Gro take away the biochar that is produced:

The story for SA is:

We have a long track record of recycling, and it’s part of the DNA in SA

We responded faster and more strategically through grants, funding, advocacy and education campaigns

SA remains rightly proud of its commitment: The first state to introduce ten cent deposits (1977), the first state to introduce a plastic bag ban (2009), the first state to commit to a single statewide education and advertising message on recycling (2018) and the first state to kick off a multi-region Plastic Free Places trial, which includes three major retail and shopping areas (The Parade, Norwood, The Adelaide Central Markets, Jetty Road Brighton) and in a world first, all 21 Surf Life Saving clubs have joined together to trial going ‘single-use plastic free’.

Shifts in global resource markets, such as the bans on waste imports under China’s “National Sword” policy are having an impact both across Australia and the globe. It is an area that needs ongoing attention, however the effects in the ACT have been limited.

The ACT Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) in Hume is operated by Re.Group. Apart from contamination, which is sent to landfill, the MRF operator advises that all recyclable materials are sold to market as part of their standard business model. This depends on market demand at the time, although the bulk of the material processed at the MRF (over 95%) is sold on the domestic market and consists of:
• Around 45-55% of material (by weight) is paper and cardboard. This is sent to a paper mill at Tumut in NSW.
• Around 30-35% is glass, which is turned into sand and sold locally.
• Other materials (ie plastic, aluminium and steel) are sold to a variety of end users based on market demand.

The ACT has a high overall resource recovery rate of around 70% for the last decade. The ACT Government’s Waste Feasibility Study in May 2018 provided a set of recommendations and a roadmap aimed at diverting and additional 170,000 tonnes of waste from landfill to head towards an 87% overall resource recovery rate in the ACT.

We have already implemented a number of these recommendations, including the Container Deposit Scheme, which as at 25 August 2019 has also seen over 33 million containers returned since the scheme began in June 2018. The government is also investigating options for increased food organics recycling and has consulted the community on developing a policy on using waste to generate energy. The government also completed a review of the development code for waste management to improve recycling outcomes in new apartment complexes. The Government has also consulted on a discussion paper on phasing out unnecessary and problematic single-use plastics.

We are now focusing on:
• Developing a detailed feasibility study into maximising diversion of organic waste from landfill, including through the delivery of a food and garden organics process site and facility, products and markets.
• Development of a pilot education campaign on food waste avoidance.
• Examining options to phase-out avoidable single-use plastics in the ACT.
• Further developing the ACT waste levy to discourage landfill and make recycling more attractive.

We also have a significant ongoing community awareness and engagement program, including:

225,Business on Board PM's Circular Economy,"Australian businesses believe there is no choice but to create a “circular economy”, but they need state governments and councils make their waste and recycling laws consistent.

In the United States, Prime Minister Scott Morrison flagged the circular economy as a priority for Australia, weaving together jobs, economic efficiency and the environment.

“I want Australia to be at the vanguard of leading an industry-led approach to a circular economy, not a government regulatory approach to that,” Mr Morrison said at an event in New York on Monday.

“I mean, industry has the wit and the capital to do it and to make a dollar out of it, and once we’re making a dollar out of it, you won’t stop us.”

He said while 80 per cent of recycled paper is turned into cardboard in Australia, just 12 per cent of plastics are recycled.

“We’ve got to get that number up. And that requires technology. But the other thing that’s going to require is a commercial industry that actually does it,” Mr Morrison said.

Australia’s recycling industry has been in crisis since Asian countries banned waste imports, and a number of local recyclers were forced to shut down due to dangerous stockpiling.

Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive James Pearson said businesses were ready to get started, but they need consistency from governments.

“I don’t think we have much choice. I think it will drive innovation,” Mr Pearson told told reporters.

“Our members are already innovating, they’re already involved in this space, they’d love to see the red tape reduced, they’d love to see government encouraging consistency.

“They know government can play a key role as a procurer.

“For example, big infrastructure projects that are rolling out across the country, (there are) major opportunities to use recycled material there in road works.”

But Mr Pearson said the state-by-state laws were so different that a national approach was needed to bring them into line.

“The more consistency we can have across the country, then we’re more like to get economies of scale,” he said.

“We’re more likely to be able to efficiently and effectively produce different waste streams into more valuable and more useful inputs.”

A recent EY report found Australia could be $328 million better off each year if recycling was treated like a resource instead of rubbish.

It found Australia’s current co-mingled method of recycling reduced the value from a typical kerbside bin to as low as $2-a-tonne.

272,Climate change strategy for business,"OPINION: As a business manager how do you plan for climate change? It's the gravest threat to business according to the World Economic Forum's 2019 report. What are the challenges and opportunities for your business?

Considering any issue early means that it will be easier for you to respond. Not only that, the opportunities are large. The Sustainable Business Network's research, carried out with Auckland Tourism Events & Economic Development, shows Auckland could be $8.8 billion better off in 2030 if the city makes the transition to a low carbon circular economy. Their report identifies opportunities for food, transport and the built environment.

What are your customers and staff thinking?

Kiwis are already prioritising for climate change in their decision making. A Victoria University survey of 9000 New Zealanders showed 74.5 per cent said they'd already made some sacrifices for this. Also 90 per cent of those taking part in the 2018 Colmar Brunton national survey ""Better Futures"" agreed that if a company is ""irresponsible or unethical, I'd stop buying their products or using their services"".

Internationally, nearly 90 per cent of adults are willing to change their personal behaviour to help tackle climate change. This was the finding of a survey of 14,000 adults from 14 countries completed for IKEA.

Your business's response will also affect your ability to hire and retain staff. In New Zealand, 86 per cent of those surveyed by Colmar Brunton agreed that ""It is important for me to work for a company that is socially and environmentally responsible.""

A ""Zero Carbon Act"" is expected to come into force late this year. The current draft has targets to reduce all greenhouse gases. Methane has a 2030 target reduction of 10 per cent, and a provisional target of 24-47 per cent reduction by 2050. All other greenhouse gases have a target of net zero by 2050. The costs for a business to emit greenhouse gases are certain to rise.

As a society we are expecting business to show leadership on climate change. From the 2019 Edelman Trust Barometer survey, 76 per cent of people said CEOs should take the lead on change, rather than waiting for government to impose it - an 11-point increase from last year.

Even in the USA, business is no longer just about shareholder returns. The Business Roundtable issues Principles of Corporate Governance. Since 1997 the principles have stated that corporations exist principally to serve shareholders. Radically changed in August 2019, the business goals now include creating ""value for customers,"" ""investing in employees,"" ""dealing fairly... with suppliers,"" ""supporting communities,"" and ""protect[ing] the environment.""

What can your business do?

First, measure your footprint. As management expert Peter Drucker said: ""What gets measured gets managed."" Your main emissions are likely to be from fuel, flights, power, vehicles, freight and waste. If you are farming, methane may be a part too.

There are free online calculators. For support and independent verification, businesses such as Ekos and Enviro-Mark Solutions can help. For small businesses, measurement can be just a few hundred dollars with Ekos – a good investment to understand your emissions.

Once you know where your emissions are, then you can look at how to reduce them. Can you use video for some meetings rather than flying? Where can you reduce waste? Could your next vehicle replacement be electric? Most of these options come with the additional benefit of cost savings.

Finally, you can offset any carbon emissions you can't avoid.

There are many examples of firms making efforts in this space, to look to for inspiration. At one end of the scale The Warehouse Group is now certified as carbon neutral. The company states, ""As New Zealand's largest retail group, we have an ethical obligation to act now.""

At the other end of the scale is the Chia Sisters, creating nutritious beverages in Nelson. As part of the company's policy to include the environment as a true cost of doing business they've offset 120 per cent of their emissions, to be 'climate positive'.

""It is important that our business is a voice for sustainability,"" founder Chloe van Dyke says.

Being certified and offsetting emissions cost their business about $1000. Chia Sisters have been overwhelmed by the positive response, with domestic sales growing by 50 per cent since they became certified.

Response will take a community-wide effort, so let's share and learn from others. Talk to your team - they know your business and can help with ideas. Talk to your industry and local business community; support sector-wide leadership.

Your customers and employees are already thinking about climate change. How is your business responding?

Putting your head in the sand on this issue is not a reasonable strategic response.

Your approach doesn't need to be perfect, but you do need to act.

282,The future of manufacturing is garbage,"A while ago I blogged about Viridi, a clever bunch that is developing a way to salvage grape sugar, tartaric acid and antioxidants from wine waste.

The Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre has also supported work by Dresden Optics, helping them automate and scale up production, in collaboration with Consonic, University of NSW and others. They’re using things like reclaimed fishing nets and beer keg lids to make eyewear and aim to one day use 100 per cent recycled plastics as their feedstock.

Why am I mentioning wine and spectacles? It’s because these two manufacturers are part of an interesting current trend.

Beyond our shores, Adidas has committed to completely phase out virgin polymer by 2024. It intends to make 11 million pairs of recycled shoescontaining recycled plastic this year, in collaboration with Parley for the Oceans. We recently saw news that a new Swedish bike manufacturer, in collaboration with Nestle, is making high-end rides out of aluminium from Nescafe pods.

In case you hadn’t guessed already, what we are talking about is the ‘Circular Economy,’ a topic that seems to be everywhere at the moment.

In simple terms given by the Ellen Macarthur Foundation, the concept is based on three principles:

● Keep products and materials in use

It might have hippy connotations for a few, but Circular Economy is about some pretty old, common-sense ideas – minimising waste and getting the most value out of the resources that have been paid for. This is the stuff of Manufacturing 101.

The concept aligns nicely with Advanced Manufacturing, and we have seen our Man-In-A-Suitcase Michael Sharpe at a tonne of Circular Economy events lately. He brings back to us that manufacturers are interested, but there’s some uncertainty around how exactly to proceed.

Downer and others are turning waste into road surfaces. 530,000 plastic bags, 168,000 glass bottles, 12,000 toner cartridges and 135 tonnes of recycled asphalt go into every kilometre of two-lane road.

The work of Professor Veena Sahajwalla, founding director of University of NSW’s award-winning Sustainable Materials Research and Technology (SMaRT) Centre, is another high-impact example. She is the inventor of “Green Steel” process, in collaboration with OneSteel and then MolyCop.

Green Steel, or Polymer Injection Technology, uses old tyres as a substitute for coke for the carbon used in steelmaking. This has saved millions of tyres from the tip so far. An estimated 56 million passenger car tyres are thrown out by Australians every year, with only a tenth of these reused. Given these huge quantities and the slowness of tyres to break down, Sahajwalla’s work has obvious appeal.

It’s no coincidence that each of these projects is a collaborative one. Manufacturers, researchers, waste collectors and others must work together for Circular Economy initiatives to succeed.

Australian governments will soon set a total ban on exporting recyclables. Given this, smarter use of our waste can only become more important. There are opportunities for smart manufacturers to step up.

378,The beating heart of the Māori economy,"Every year Matariki X brings Māori innovators and entrepreneurs together to share their experiences and inspire one another. Callaghan Innovation’s Vinnie Campbell says the Māori economy’s biggest strengths have nothing to do with money.

This story was funded by The Spinoff Members. For more about becoming a member and supporting The Spinoff’s journalism click here.

Vinnie Campbell (Ngāi Te Rangi, Ngāti Pukenga) is chatting happily with dozens of people as they criss cross the foyer at Rotorua’s Enery Events Centre. Callaghan Innovation’s acting group manager for the Māori economy is finally able to relax now that months of work is coming to fruition at Matariki X, the Māori economy’s largest annual event.

It’s the fourth year of the event, which started with a humble 50 attendees and now easily fills the main theatre. “It’s definitely changed and evolved from our first one!” he says. “The kaupapa was simply to inspire. To be entrepreneurs, innovators. Simply come along and listen to te ao Māori’s best and brightest entrepreneurs.”

This year the full-day event involves a morning of speakers from different business disciplines, an afternoon of masterclasses and a drinks and dinner “eco-connect” event hosted by 2019 Innovator of the Year, Ian Taylor. Attendees can plan their day and interact with speakers via a dedicated app.

Inspiration is the name of the game, but at the end of the day, it’s the connections that give Matariki X so much meaning, says Campbell.

“Of all the great things that have come from Matariki X, the main thing has been connections; the networking. Not just the participants that come along to listen but the speakers and panellists. The Matariki alumni!”

He lists the star speakers that have come through their doors – Steve Saunders, Jason Witehera, Bailey Mackey, Rachel Taulelei, Miriana Stephens.

“None of them knew one another, or if they did, they didn’t know them well. The connection they’ve made here has strengthened the Māori economy exponentially.”

Campbell is adamant it doesn’t matter the size of the business venture – the whakawhanaungatanga that happens at Matariki X puts everyone on an even footing. “The small and medium-sized, the pre-revenue company right up to the Ngāi Tahus of this world. It doesn’t matter.”

Because Māori IP is in such high demand, Matariki X and Callaghan’s Māori development team have a strong focus on international markets. The 12 masterclasses on offer include the circular economy, social impact, investment and building a global business. “A lot of our exemplars are big players on the words stage. They’re commercialising their ideas, commercialising their products. That’s what we wanted to expose people to.”

The key message from their speakers is always the same – innovation means nothing without hard work. “Bailey Mackay [owner/founder of Pango Productions], hard core Ngāti Porou; Steve Saunders [of Robotics Plus], Tauranga Moana, started right from the bottom and got where they are today with hard work. We wanted to expose people to the hard work that is needed to be successful. All our speakers exemplify that It doesn’t happen over night, you’ve got to have resilience. And persistence.”

In addition to the hard graft, he says the most successful projects are those with a point of difference – which is innate for Māori. “We took some Māori kids to Stanford [University], Silicon Valley and a few other places in the States four years ago. The Silicon Valley guys were asking the kids: ‘What’s your point of difference? Your culture!’ These are guys that have just sold $500 million companies.”

He stresses that for entrepreneurs here or in Silicon Valley, money is rarely the first or even second step. “Many of these people we talked to over there said they had no money when they started, but they had an idea. How did they become successful? They surrounded themselves with smart people, mates from uni for instance. They knocked on 145 doors and behind the 146th door someone said ‘yes, I will invest in your company’. For our kids and budding entrepreneurs to hear that stuff is just awesome.”

Māori are not typically the first to sing their own praises to the world but Campbell says he’s slowly seeing the whakamā mindset change over time in the business community.

“What’s that whakataukī? ‘E kore te kumara e ki ake mō tōna reka’ (the kūmara does not speak of its own sweetness). Yes, that is a factor, but I think it’s becoming less so. As our people realise, as they grow in the world of innovation and entrepreneurialism and come to grips with the te ao hurihuri (the changing world), that’s becoming less and less of a factor. People actually realise ‘you’ve got to tell your story’. No one else is going to tell it for you.”

Those unique stories have proven popular in markets like Asia, where strong values of family and reciprocity are shared. “One of our points of difference is manaakitanga and whanaungatanga. Looking after your guests. Taking time to get to know your potential business partner. In my opinion the rest of the business world can learn from that. We see mainstream businesses that are all about the mahi. They come into Callaghan Innovation and we put on a mihi whatau for that exact reason. To get to know the person. Find some commonality. That’s one of the keys points about our culture. And manaaki whenua, sustainability.”

He says “green kaupapa” is something Callaghan looks for in all it’s potential business partners. “The good thing about Callahan is that we have contacts globally that are leading the way in sustainability. So we can expose our people to what’s happening on the world stage, not just in our own backyard. Connecting Māori to international whakaaro, events, conferences is something Callahan does particularly well.”

As for next year’s conference, he has faith in the evolution of the event. The heavy hitters won’t always be available, but the next generation of business leaders is already coming through.

“Of course we’ve got some big hitters in the Māori economy but we can’t bring them out every year, people will get sick of them! So we have to find the next generation, the pipeline of awesome entrepreneurs, which is what we’ve got today with the likes of Jesse Armstrong and Billie Jo Ropiha. She’s like, wow!”

396,Logistics must be part of any circular economy strategies,"The Victorian government is developing a circular economy policy and action plan for the state that will be released later, this year.

But critics say the strategy is missing a key component – logistics – and it’s one that is often missing when people think about a circular economy.

RMIT Professor Scott Valentine tells The Fifth Estate that circular economy approaches will mean a gradual shift from the current dependence on long-haul freight and shipping, to shorter trips.

This gives us an opportunity to rethink the whole logistics picture so we can shrink the sector’s emissions, create jobs, stimulate local economies and advance innovation.

Valentine says there has not been enough attention paid to logistics in the Victorian strategy. He and other researchers from RMIT’s CE Hub are urging Victoria to look at the strategy as more than just recycling re-branded.

It is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to align resource efficiency, eco-innovation, behaviour change and waste management in the state.

There are three things we need to have in place and plan for, says Valentine.

Firstly, a materials tracking strategy. We need to understand where the materials are coming from and going to.

Secondly, we need a digital platform to trade materials more efficiently.

Finally, we need a solution for the delivery of materials from vendor to buyer, which is where transport comes in.

There are three main freight modes in Australia: sea, rail and road.

Shipping is generally considered the lowest carbon mode, because the massive cargo weights mean the emissions per tonne of freight are small.

However, the main fuel used – bunker oil, a by-product of crude oil distillation – is highly polluting . There are CO2 emissions from its combustion and the fuels used by most ships have high sulphur oxide emissions, contributing to hundreds of thousands of cases of respiratory disease in portside communities around the world. Sulphur emissions also cause acid rain and degrade coral reefs.

The International Maritime Organisation has passed a resolution that will see all ships required to reduce sulphur emissions from 1 January, 2020 either by switching to low-sulphur bunker oil, and installing “scrubbers” to capture the pollution, or by not using bunker oil at all. Some ships already use liquefied natural gas and others are shifting to heavy biodiesels, which does not require extensive changes to a ship’s engine.

IKEA Transport and Logistics Services is one company that has made a move in this area, announcing in March it was investing in fuelling a container ship with biofuel oil manufactured from waste cooking oil and forest residues. The biofuel is made by Netherlands’ based company GoodFuels.

IKEA says using the new fuel is a step towards realising its plan to reduce emissions per transport shipment by 70 per cent by 2030.

“This is a huge ambition since shipping over the ocean makes up almost 50 per cent of our carbon footprint regarding transports,” said Elisabeth Munck af Rosenschöld, head of sustainability at IKEA Global Transport and Logistics Services.

In the freight world, rail has the second-lowest carbon footprint. Australian freight trains use diesel locomotives but the volume of goods a freight train can carry makes the footprint per tonne smaller than an equivalent tonne of goods carried by the diesel-powered B-Double trucks that dominate the nation’s highways.

If we want to change the freight emissions picture we need shorter, localised and possibly more frequent trips.

Valentine says electric vans and trucks could be used to transport material and goods over short distances.

“It is a move from a global to a geographically close focus and, for short hauls, electric vehicles could provide effective service,” he says.

For example, Japan’s Yamato Black Cat logistics service uses small vans and trucks in a digitally-enabled, “seamless web”, integrating multiple distribution and handling facilities to provide a same-day, rapid freight service that suits the “just-in-time” mentality of Japanese companies.

Despite Australian distances being much greater than those in Japan, a similar approach is possible.

Valentine says technologies such as Radio Frequency Identification [RFID] tagging, smart pallets, digital real-time shipment tracking and warehouse management, electric trucks and vans can all play a role in disrupting the industry and sparking change.

Add in the circular economy factor, where materials are constantly being moved from one site to another, and there’s an opportunity to stimulate the development of distribution, warehousing and logistics nodes in regional communities. If this doesn’t happen, a shift to a circular economy could increase pollution and transportation congestion.

There are plenty of job opportunities, such as managing and operating the digital side of operations, and cleaner, safer jobs managing warehouse functions.

Smarter solutions can also reduce packaging. Specially-designed electric vehicles for carrying materials, including raw materials and liquids, need to be on the drawing board, Valentine says.

“In a circular economy, we can start to minimize packaging materials because we are delivering more inputs than finished products.”

However, new handling techniques would need to be developed, and new business models and practices may emerge. It is not unusual for transport companies to provide warehousing. In the near future, as the circular economy grows, they could be competing with existing waste management companies, who begin to provide transport.

A move into materials tracking, recovery and distribution would be a good add-on for a logistics business. Or perhaps waste management firms will be the ones to add the extra services that make them closed-loop resource movers.

As local webs around materials start to evolve, we will need less long-haul freight traffic, and that means less pollution and traffic on our roads, says Valentine.

“When we start along the path [to a circular economy], we start to ask interesting questions, such as can we co-locate with other players in our supply chain” he says.

“If we try designing a circular economy strategy with a recycling frame of mind, as is currently the case [in Victoria], essential elements will become neglected and corporate uptake jeopardised,” says Valentine.

“If implemented correctly, a circular economy strategy will enhance corporate profitability, reduce resource costs, make Australian industry more competitive and create new business and new jobs.”

He says the researchers, rather than criticising the Victorian government’s initiative, are suggesting that it needs to be considered as a “complex, adaptive system”.

That means all industries, researchers and other experts need to be involved.

“If we have that, we can start to identify some really positive industry initiatives.”",Australia,2019.09
410,South Australian companies reusing and recycling to beat global crisis,"South Australia has embraced the circular economy with a state-wide ban of single-use plastics, a commitment to renewable energy and a roster of reputable companies driving reuse.

Although the United Nations reports that less than 10 per cent of all the world’s plastic is recycled, South Australia diverts more than 80 per cent of its waste from landfill to be composted or reused in the circular economy according to a sustainability report by the South Australian government.

The circular economy, driven by renewable flows of energy, is an adjacent model to the linear economy (create, use, discard) and aims to regenerate a product or material at its end of life.

South Australia’s engagement with the circular economy is demonstrated by the its commitment to sustainability – the state harvests eight gigalitres of storm water annually for reuse and sources more than 50 per cent of its energy from renewable sources – as well as subsidies for these industries and policies.

When South Australian Minister for Environment and Water David Speirs announced the impending ban of single use plastics in July, he said the prohibition of these materials cemented the state as a leader in the war on waste.

Speirs said South Australia is committed to working with the community and stakeholders to address the impacts of single-use plastic “to ensure that we continue to maintain this state’s reputation as a leader in waste management”.

Local companies are leading the way for green innovation, with a range of enterprises breathing new life into materials and engaging with the circular economy.

Here are four innovative companies in South Australia that reuse resources and eliminate unwanted materials.

The Northern Adelaide Waste Management Authority (NAWMA) is a garbage, recycling and green waste collection service that has operated in the state’s capital of Adelaide since 1999.

The company diverts 2,1000 tonnes of material intended for waste through bin collections or commercial pick-ups annually in the Northern region, and 30,000 tonnes from the broader South Australian community.

Eighty-three per cent of all waste it collects is diverted from landfill and what it can’t divert is harvested for methane gas to supplement the solar power that runs the factory.

NAWMA works with local councils to collect waste and sells their harvested recycled materials to other businesses to close the circular economy loop.

NAWMA Education and Projects Coordinator Penelope Morrison said South Australia was the first Australian jurisdiction to have a Circular Economy Strategy and leads the way in waste management.

“With globally competitive recycling rates, a mature resource recovery sector, and engaged stakeholders at all levels, South Australia is looked upon by an international audience on how to responsibly manage resources,” said Morrison.

“NAWMA has made a series of bold commitments, including processing 100 per cent of the yellow bin on Australian Shores by 2020, and working with our councils to purchase 50 per cent of recyclables back in the form of sustainable procurement by 2023.

“These two commitments will singlehandedly transition the resource recovery sector to a circular solution.”

Advanced Plastic Recycling (APR) has transformed discarded materials into furniture and timber alternatives for 16 years.

The company converts melted HDPE (high-density polyethylene) pellets into a wood plastic composite material for private infrastructure pieces such as bollards, benches, boardwalks and more.

The material is a wood plastic blend that makes the products stronger, more weatherable and environmentally friendly because it does not leach chemicals into the ground like treated wood and it reuses unwanted plastic.

CEO Ryan Lokan said South Australia is the most advanced state in Australia in regards to the circular economy, and has largest amount of supportive infrastructure.

“We are an antidote to the recycling crisis in the sense that we then take that pellet and create a product that is both environmentally friendly, sustainable, economic and environmental. It’s an alternative to cutting down trees to pulling up natural resources,” said Lokan.

“Right now those arrows sort of represent the movement of the plastic, whereas what we’re trying to do is turn the arrows around and say it should be based on demand.

“The greater the demand for my products by councils, then the greater the demand I have for clean plastic, and the greater demand he has for mix plastics, and the greater demand they have for positive collections.”

Container Deposit Systems (CDS) has been at the forefront of recycling since 1977 with the introduction of its bottles and containers refund scheme.

CDS employs Semi Auto Return Terminals (ART) which allow customers to return deposit cans, plastic bottles and glass in any condition for a 10c-per-container refund.

The ARTs identify and sort containers through an integration of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technology and a vision counting and sorting system developed by Adelaide-based technology and engineering company SAGE Automation.

CDS aims reduce litter and be an active participant in resource recovery.

Although the Environmental Protection Agency South Australia reports beverage containers make up only 2.8 per cent of litter, the state has a return rate of almost 77 per cent and leads the nation.

SAGE Automation designed the new smart container deposit systems and General Manager Paul Johnson said the terminals are above 99 per cent accurate in counting deposit containers.

“The vision system that identifies the containers is bespoke, and we hope for it to become a national solution.”

Hans Van Schaik has experimented with composted materials, to find their value as a resource, for almost half a decade.

Van Shaik engages with the circular economy by developing and manufacturing mulch, soil and substrates from natural materials that would be discarded for his company Bio Gro.

By diverting green waste from landfill the company can convert materials – some of which is animal waste collected from abattoirs – into high quality products for private and commercial horticultural and agricultural industries, like soil conditioners, mulch and liquid stimulants.

The company also provides wood residue to hydroponic grower Holla-Fresh. Holla-Fresh then provides the plant bi-product biochar – valuable soil in the form of charcoal – to Bio Gro to manufacture products.

Production innovation and marketing manager Darren Free said Bio Gro’s circular recovery business model processes and diverts around 300,000 tonnes of waste a year from landfill.

“Recovered forestry material, construction timbers, agricultural bi-products, green and food organics is composted and processed into a variety of high-quality products,” Free said.

“The pine bark recovered from the timber industry is processed and composted turning it into premium potting mix. This is then used by the nursery industry to grow plants, it’s even used to grow new pine trees. The potting mix is also bagged and sold into the retail market for home gardeners.

“This is an important demonstration of a local company’s endeavours in creating a business model based on landfill diversion and an organic circular economy to reduce harmful gases being released into the atmosphere.”

416,In a circular economy we could 'pay per use',"Circular economy - a couple of words that we are going to hear more about in the near future as the Victorian government develops a circular economy policy in the coming months. The circular economy policy will help in finding new ways for Victorian businesses and communities to use materials more efficiently and avoid waste in all stages of making, using and disposing of the products and infrastructure we rely on every day. The circular economy is designed to replace and address the social and environmental impacts of the current ""linear economy"" with its ""take, make, dispose"" model, depleting finite reserves to create products that end up in landfill. It achieves its objectives through long-lasting design, maintenance, repair, reuse, re-manufacturing, refurbishing, and recycling - reducing waste to zero. The definition of a circular economy has been defined for the Victorian Government policy as: If we consider changing the way we view ownership by changing to an access and performance model then we could see some significant changes to the way we consume. One example is the ""pay per use"" contractual agreements associated with smartphones which could be extended to standard goods such as washing machines, clothes and DIY equipment. This would see us become users rather than consumers. So how is this all going to happen? As we start to see greater emphasis on the collaborative economy that supports use over ownership we can expect to see significant changes in the way we operate in the coming decades.",Australia,2019.09
430,Woolies announces “circular economy” beer made from unused bread,"Supermarket chain Woolworths (ASX:WOW) is the latest company to announce a circular economy-based initiative, with a limited edition release of beer containing re-purposed bread loaves.

In a statement today, Woolworths announced a pale ale named “Loafer”, made by Goulburn’s Tribe Breweries and to be sold through the Woolworths-owned Dan Murphy’s and BWS chains. 50 cents from a $25 six-pack will be given to Feed Appeal, a not-for-profit that fund-raises provides grants to food relief charities.

A claimed 350 kilograms of bread has been used in the batch. This translates to roughly 540 loaves, assuming a 650-gram loaf.

“We’re excited to bring to Australians our first circular economy craft beer.” said Woolworths head of sustainability, Adrian Cullen, in a statement.

Josh Gaudry, head of innovation at Tribe, said the collected bread was part of the base of the brew, and had contributed “the aroma of fresh toast to produce an easy going pale ale with bright hoppy aromas reminiscent of pear and pineapple.”

According to Food Rescue Charity Oz Harvest, bread is “one of the most wasted foods” in Australia, which created an estimated five million tonnes of food waste in 2016-17.

Re-purposing unused bread in beer is not a completely new idea. UK brewer Toast Ale has used surplus bread – toasted, mashed and brewed – to create pale ale. Toast Ale itself was inspired by work by the Brussels Beer Project, according to a 2017 interview with Toast’s founder.

432,Woolies’ surprising plan for unused bread,"Unsold loaves of bread from Woolworths Supermarkets have been repurposed and brewed into ‘Loafer’ — a limited edition pale ale.

The war on food waste at Woolworths has turned biblical with a new plan to convert unsold loaves of bread into beer.

The major supermarket has dubbed the new brew the “first circular economy beer” as more than 350 kilograms of leftover bread will skip landfill and head into vats at Tribe Breweries.

The limited edition Loafer pale ale will be sold exclusively through the company’s partners BWS and Dan Murphy’s and help raise funds for the Feed Appeal which focuses on providing meals to Aussies impacted by food security.

RELATED: Woolworths says it has dramatically reduced wastage

“We like to constantly challenge ourselves in the sustainability and community space and look at how we can make an impact simply by doing things differently,” Woolworths head of sustainability Adrian Cullen said.

“The ability to divert surplus food away from landfill, and to help support our local food rescue partners to help feed Australians that would otherwise go hungry, is a critical part of our day-to-day operations and support of the community.

“We’re excited to bring to Australians our first circular economy craft beer.

“For every 6 pack of Loafer purchased, you will not only help to put a meal on the table for someone in need, but you will also be enjoying a beer that has helped divert unsold loaves of bread from heading to landfill.”

Head of innovation at Goulburn-based Tribe Breweries in regional NSW, Josh Gaudry, who have been entrusted to craft the brew, said the ale is the “best thing since slice bread”.

“We wanted to create a beautiful craft beer and were excited to be able to support Feed Appeal and Woolworths in their fight against hunger and food waste,” he said.

“Through collecting rescued bread from Woolworths, we were able to incorporate this into the base of our brew, and lovingly crafted each beer with the aroma of fresh toast to produce an easy going pale ale with bright hoppy aromas reminiscent of pear and pineapple.”

The money raised will go to the not-for-profit organisation which provides grants to support local charities who deliver food relief programs and meals to vulnerable Australians.

“Feed Appeal is here to help everyday Australian families who rely on food charities in their local community for their next meal,” the organisation’s chief executive Katherine Gokavi-Whaley said.

“All money raised through the purchase of ‘Loafer’ goes directly to community food relief charities to supply ovens, freezers, cool rooms, transport and other vital infrastructure to help them store, cook and share meals often cooked from rescued food to meet the growing demand for food relief.

“We are pleased to see that there is now good beer, doing good on the market.”

The beer will be available until stocks last with 50 cents per six pack going to Feed Appeal and $2 per slab.

442,Recycling vineyard plastics makes circular economy real,"There is no doubt the idea of a circular economy, where manufacturers reclaim used materials to make products that can themselves be recycled again and again, is a great idea.

But getting from the dream to the reality requires such enormous goodwill and co-ordinated effort from manufacturers and end-users, that it very rarely occurs.

In South Australia chemical engineer Uma Preston, director of Sustaining Endeavour, has created what is a poster boy for the circular economy in the state’s massive wine industry.

The problem is obvious, with 240,395 kilometres of vines, winegrowers face a massive problem regularly replacing the driptubes that supply water to the roots – what to do with the used plastic.

Preston has facilitated a network of vineyards, local machinery depots, plastic recyclers and manufacturers to turn driptube that normally go into landfill into useful products.

Preston said: “In this local circular economy, plastic resources are kept at the highest value possible, and made to continuously circulate in a closed loop.

“This is in contrast to linear economies where end-of-life products are disposed to landfill.”

So far 1,500 km of dripperlines have been recycled by Recycling Plastics Australia‘s Kilburn plant north of Adelaide into 110 tonnes of ‘as new’ plastic resin.

Sourced from vineyards including TWE growers and Yalumba from the south-east, d’Arenberg and Wirra Wirra in McLaren Vale, and Henchke in the Barossa, the resin is used to make:

# Netafim’s LDPE Pipe is UV and acid resistant, and made of high quality resins and recycled dripperlines.

# Woodshield Posts are designed for use in the Viticulture, Aquaculture, Equine and Agri industries. Made up of a core of untreated pine coated with six mm of plastic, they are available in 75 mm standard post and 113 mm row and end post sizes.

Preston said: “A key priority now is to let growers know about the recycling service, to build their appreciation of Sustaining Endeavour’s circular economy, and to win support for the products that contain the recycled resin.”

Preston’s work was supported through a Circular Economy Market Development Grant from Green Industries SA, co-investment from RPA, Netafim and Woodshield, local grower associations and regional supply stores.

Growers borrow a special re-coiling machine, provided by a Recycling Infrastructure Grant, from the local stores and coil and stack the driptube for transport to Adelaide.

Growers pay for freight, plus a $25 processing fee and $1 per kilometre of tube to transport the driptube to Adelaide.

RPA is able to recycle the material because of the commitments from Netafim and Woodshield for the purchase of minimum volumes.

It is this complex set of payments and subsidies from government, manufacturers and growers that makes Suataining Endeavour’s job of facilitation so important.

Without Preston drive and hard work there would be little alternative for thousands of kilometres of driptube but to end up in landfill or export.

Sustaining Endeavour tracks the amount of end-of-life driptube available for recycling, schedules consignments and issues local circular economy recycling certificates.

Preston said: “South Australians need to support the products derived from their own waste stream

“Circular Economy business models like this one help secure plastics recycling in South Australia and jobs in Australian manufacturing more broadly.”

464,"This week in banking news - RBA, IMT, and the circular economy","This week in banking news - RBA, IMT, and the circular economy

In this week’s banking recap, we look at Tuesday’s RBA decision, the circular economy, and the ways that loyalty to the big banks is costing Australians.

Following its meeting earlier this week, the Reserve Bank announced it will be keeping official interest rates at 1.00% for another month. But with the economy currently stalling, more rate cuts in the near future are pretty much a certainty at this point.

“The persistent downside risks to the global economy combined with subdued inflation have led a number of central banks to reduce interest rates this year and further monetary easing is widely expected,” said RBA Governor, Philip Lowe.

Are you paying a convenience tax on your home loan?

When you’ve held your savings with the one bank all your life, it might be convenient to turn to them when it comes time to take out a home loan, but is it really the best call? A recent report by ASIC found that while 60% of Aussie home buyers stick with their existing bank when signing up for a mortgage, their loyalty isn’t always rewarded with lower rates.

We aren’t just relying on our banks when it comes to home loans. They’re also first on the call sheet for Aussies looking to send money abroad or transfer between currencies. This comes via a new report from the ACCC, which found that opting for the big banks over alternative IMT providers is costing Australians hundreds of millions of dollars each year. With better deals available elsewhere, Aussies are being urged to shop around.

The circular economy: a way to save?

One of the big things holding people back from embracing sustainable living is that it’s not always cheap. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t ways to be kind to the planet and your wallet at the same time. This week, we took a look at the circular economy, and how borrowing, swapping, and buying pre-owned items make for a cost-effective way to help the environment.

On that note, if you’re looking to clear out your house of any unused goods, you might find you’re sitting on much more money than expected. According to Gumtree’s Second Hand Economy Report, the average Aussie household has around $5,300 worth of unused or unwanted items, adding up to a whopping $43 billion.

492,5 ways taking part in the circular economy could help you save money,"5 ways taking part in the circular economy could help you save money

Let’s face it, being eco-friendly sometimes feels like the more expensive option. Buying organic food, investing in renewables and choosing to buy ethical can set you back more than a few dollars. But being green doesn’t have to cost you the earth. In fact, there are lots of ways you can help make a difference to the planet and your savings account.

Embracing a whole new approach to what you use and what you throw away, could just help you stash more cash for a rainy day. Taking part in the circular economy is a great way to stop wasting not only the earth’s resources, but also your own hard earned money.

But you might be wondering what the circular economy is? What does it entail? And how can it help save you money and help save the planet?

What is the circular economy?

Right now, like almost everyone else, you’re probably used to a more linear economy. In the linear economy items are made, used and then disposed of.

The circular economy tries to do better by eliminating waste; in a circular economy items are made, used, mended when they break, reused and recycled into something else, after which the whole process can start again.



It really is as simple as that, reusing, mending and recycling. Plus throw borrowing and sharing into the mix, and you’re that much closer to reaching your savings goals!

Here’s a few tips on how you can live life in less of a straight line and start giving circles more love:



One simple way to join the circular economy and save money is by borrowing things you only use once. For example, instead of buying an expensive suit or dress to wear once at a wedding or other special occasion, why not think about hiring one.

Hiring a one-off outfit isn’t just a great way to reduce waste, it’s also a pretty shrewd way for the financially savvy to keep on trend and save money. One website we looked at had the option to rent a $320 dress for $89, saving you $231 and space in your closet on an item of clothing that chances are you won’t wear again.

Other ways to save money by borrowing is to join your local library. You can easily drop between $20 to $50 on a new book, whereas borrowing from the library shouldn’t cost you a cent. Plus the return deadline that comes with borrowing could spur you on to finish it!

Of course borrowing isn’t just limited to books and clothing. Since 2013 tool libraries have been popping up in different states across Australia, to champion a more sustainable way of living. All you have to do is pay an annual membership fee and you can borrow anything from a set of spanners to a sewing machine.

Another way to cut your costs and contribute to the circular economy is to fix what you already own. If your favourite shirt starts coming away at the seams don’t give up on it! Mend what you have, you could even set aside one evening each week to take care of all your repairs, whether it be sewing a button back on or sewing up a hole in your pants seam.

If you’re not too confident with sewing then check out a tutorial online or take your items in need of repair to your local alterations specialist.

This goes for other household items too; if you have an appliance or piece of furniture that’s busted, don’t drop money on a new one! Find your nearest Repair Cafe and see if someone can help you bring it back to life for free.

Repair Cafes are becoming more and more popular in Australia, they are run by volunteers and usually open a couple of times a month. Bring your broken item along for help fixing it, you could even gain some hands on knowledge for how to repair it next time!

3. Sell it on or swap it for something else

If you’re really not too keen on keeping an item of clothing or you have an old bicycle you no longer have space for then think about selling it on, instead of throwing it away.

Some good options for selling on your shirts, shoes, DVDs, kitchen appliances, white goods and other household items are:
• eBay - you can list up to 40 items for free on eBay. The website does take a small cut if you sell something, but you’ll still make some cash.
• Facebook Marketplace - Facebook’s digital marketplace is a great place to make a quick buck on furniture or appliances that you need to shift
• Gumtree - it’s a great site for listing larger items, such as fridges and vacuum cleaners with the option for the buyer to pick up, at no extra cost to you.
• Try out the app Carousell - it’s simple to use and you can advertise anything from furniture to fashion accessories, and give the buyer the option to pick up.
• Join your local buy, swap and sell page on Facebook. This way you can interact with people in your area who might be in need of that one piece of furniture you’re keen to get rid of. Or if there isn’t a buy, swap and sell page for your area, think about starting one yourself!
• Find out about suitcase rummages near you and make some quick cash out of all the clothes, shoes and accessories you no longer want.

You often won’t get back what you paid for something, but you’ll free up space and make a little bit of cash in the process. Plus selling it on means another person can save money on a brand new item, and save the planet by giving your unwanted goods more love.

While selling on can raise a bit of cash, buying pre-loved can also save you a lot of money. You can find some pretty unusual items in thrift stores or vintage shops, and remember if something doesn’t quite fit you could also have it altered by an alterations specialist. Not only will you have a totally unique item to wear, but you’ll most likely spend a lot less than you would on buying something first-hand.

Online marketplaces and buy, swap and sell websites are also a good place to save hundreds of dollars on white goods such as washing machines and fridges and necessary items such as vacuum cleaners. A good tip to remember is that sellers sometimes put larger items on for next-to-nothing if they are moving and have to get rid of them by a certain date.

If you acquire big ticket items such as these from online marketplaces, you’re not only saving yourself a lot of money, you’re also saving an item from being sent unnecessarily to landfill!

Talking of rubbish sent to landfill, it’s common knowledge by now that disposable containers, such as throwaway coffee cups, plastic straws and cutlery are bad for the environment. They can’t be recycled and our landfills are overflowing with them!

Investing in a reusable cup will not only reduce your waste but might also get you a sweet discount. A number of cafes offer money off when you BYO cup. Just think you could be saving 50c on your daily morning coffee, which over the course of a week really adds up! Check out the Responsible Cafes website to find out what cafes offer a discount, or ask your regular if they give money off for bringing your own.

You could even think bigger! Think about bringing reusable containers for all your takeaway food. The website Trashless Takeaway lists cafes, restaurants, bulk whole food stores, delicatessens and butchers that accept reusable containers, it even tells you which ones give you a discount when you BYO.

Or if you want to save money on takeaways full stop, think about preparing your weekly lunches at the weekend. Set aside some time on a Sunday to cook your meals for the week. Not only will you be saving the planet by reusing your own container, but you’ll also be saving a lot on pricey cafe food.

524,What is a circular economy and how will it affect me?,"The introduction of a circular economy policy in Victoria will open new business opportunities for Ballarat and change the way consumers purchase goods, according to one of the region's waste management leaders. Grampians Central West Waste and Resource Recovery Group chief executive La Vergne Lehmann said the policy would 'profoundly' change aspects of the economy, including business decisions and consumer choices. ""If we impact the way business operates we will impact the way people operate within that economy as well and that is the consumer,"" she said. The Victorian Government is currently developing a draft of the policy to be released later this year that will guide the way Victoria thinks about waste and resource recovery. A workshop will be held at the Lucas Community Hub on Monday from 1pm to 5pm for members of the Ballarat community to have their say on actions to deliver the policy in the next five years. The term 'circular economy' refers to a closed loop system where products do not go to landfill. Instead products are used, repaired, reused, re-manufactured or recycled. In a circular economy people minimise waste and make the most of resources, hence reducing impacts on the environment and increasing the value people obtain from goods and services. Products are designed so they are durable and can be readily repaired, reused and recycled at the end of their lives. Business models will encourage efficient product use, like sharing products between multiple users, or supplying services that include maintenance, repair and disposal. It will find new ways to use materials more efficiently and avoid waste in all stages of making. Ms Lehmann said small scale circular economies were already running in Ballarat through community initiatives like Boomerang Bags and Repair Cafe. ""The Boomerang Bags is a great example of a small scale circular economy where essentially you are using a waste product to be a more permanent solution to a plastic bag that would ordinarily have been thrown out,"" she said. ""Repair Cafes are a great example of a circular economy as well because they work to keep things in the system for a lot longer. The idea of more repair and mending are all significant aspects of a good circular economy model."" The tag line for the circular economy policy is 'creating more value and less waste'. With rapid population growth, the amount of materials used and thrown away is growing. Victoria will generate almost 60 per cent more waste by 2046 than it did in 2015, according to the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning. This will increase pressure on waste and resource recovery systems and, without further action, may require the establishment of new or expanded landfills. The circular economy policy is being created as Victoria's recycling challenges have worsened with China's decision to restrict the import of low quality mixed recyclables last year and the shut down of SKM Recycling. READ MORE: Recycling giant SKM folds, owing millions of dollars Local governments across the state, including in Ballarat are looking to the state government for guidance on their next waste management decisions. City of Ballarat has said it would wait for the release of the circular economy policy before making further decisions on the establishment of a waste to energy plant in Ballarat. READ MORE: Hiatus for Ballarat's waste-to-energy plans The state government says shifting to a more circular economy will also grow the economy and increase jobs while avoiding waste. While Victoria has substantially improved its recycling system over time, much end-of-life material-over four million tonnes-is still sent to landfill each year. This effectively removes the potential value of those materials from the economy. Currently, 95 per cent of plastic packaging material value is lost after just one use. According to the state government, moving towards a more circular economy and improving how we use materials could: The circular economy policy will impact businesses and organisations, communities, local governments and households by encouraging improved material use. Ms Lehmann said the flow on effects of the policy would impact everyone. ""There will be opportunities for businesses to develop new business streams within their current business or completely new businesses will emerge,"" she said. ""There will be opportunities to create packaging with more recycled product in it and for businesses to create refillable and reusable products for example. So that means the way you purchase will be different as well."" RELATED COVERAGE: Ballarat Ethical Fashion Festival provides inspiration to reduce fashion waste The circular economy issues paper says jobs will increase with materials efficiency improvements. Australian Government analysis suggests 9.2 full time jobs are created for every 10,000 tonnes of material recycled compared to 2.8 jobs per 10,000 tonnes sent to landfill. For businesses, there will be new opportunities to create new products and offer services such as repair, refurbishment, or product leasing. The draft circular economy policy and action plan is expected to be released in September. Actions will be implemented from 2020 to 2030. Businesses, communities, councils and households have been asked to provide information on any barriers that are stopping improved material use, how these barriers could be overcome and what opportunities could be realised if they were removed as part of consultation.

32,The shift from a throwaway society to a more circular economy,"Associate Environment Minister Eugenie Sage: ""It's about shifting from a throwaway society to one in which we are more careful about how resources flow through the economy"".

OPINION: Recently a small male pilot whale washed ashore on a beach in southern Thailand. It died of starvation after swallowing 80 plastic shopping bags. One of the finalists in this year's International Wildlife Photographer competition shows a tiny seahorse latched onto a plastic-stemmed cotton bud.

Scientists estimate there are more than 150 million tonnes of plastics in the ocean today. If nothing changes, then it is projected that plastic in oceans will weigh more than all the fish that live in them by 2050.

As associate minister for the environment with responsibility for waste, it's my job to make sure New Zealand does its share to clean up our act when it comes to plastic pollution.

Recently Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and I announced the Government's plan to phase out single-use plastic bags. At the weekend I announced a work programme to tackle the tougher problems associated with the mountains of waste we produce.

 * Kiwi grandmothers pick fight against roadside litter

 * Condoms, razor blades and syringes raise concerns

The first task is to expand the number of landfills the waste disposal levy applies to. New Zealand has more than 420 known landfills, and the levy applies to only 11 per cent of them – largely the metropolitan landfills accepting household waste – and it applies to only an estimated 30 per cent of the waste stream.

According to surveys done in Auckland, construction and demolition waste accounts for about 85 per cent of the waste stream. Yet the levy applies to very few landfills where this material ends up. The levy needs to be extended to level the playing field across different types of waste and provide an incentive to encourage materials recovery and divert waste from landfill. We'll also consider whether the levy rate should be increased, consult the public and ensure the costs are reasonable.

Revenue from the landfill levy will be recycled to help councils, progressive businesses and community organisations minimise and divert waste from landfills. It will increase the ability of the Waste Minimisation Fund to invest in activities that support reduction, recovery, reuse, remanufacturing, repurposing, recycling and composting. Our waste plan will help create more jobs in the recycling and materials recovery sectors.

The second and long-overdue task is to improve the data and information available on waste. We lack a full national picture of what is going to landfill, and what is being recovered or recycled. Knowing this is critical if we are to make informed decisions.

The third big change is to develop and implement mandatory product stewardship schemes, starting with tyres, so that everyone helps take responsibility for the waste they create.

We have good law in New Zealand in the Waste Minimisation Act 2008, but have failed over the past decade to use the opportunities it provides to identify priority products and create mandatory stewardship schemes for them.

Canada has 94 product categories covered by legislated schemes where producers, retailers and consumers of products all share in the costs of dealing with those products at the end of their life and reduce waste to landfill. New Zealand has only 15 schemes, all of them voluntary, with varying levels of coverage.

I have asked ministry experts to work with businesses and the tyre sector to develop a mandatory product stewardship scheme to prevent end-of-life tyres ending up in stockpiles and posing fire and environmental risks or being illegally dumped. Unlike most other OECD countries, we have no pricing incentives to fund effective tyre take-back schemes, improved management or domestic tyre recycling.

I have also asked officials to resume work on developing more mandatory product stewardship schemes to deal with other key waste streams such as e-waste (starting with lithium batteries), and agrichemical containers. This will build on the great work of the AgRecovery Scheme.

New Zealand is feeling the effects of the Chinese Government's decision to close its borders to mixed recyclables so that China is no longer a dumping ground for the world's rubbish. China's decision creates both challenges and opportunities.

The Ministry for the Environment has created a taskforce dedicated to leading the response to this challenge, with an external working group with representatives from councils and industry to provide independent advice. It's due to report back in the next two months.

We currently recycle just 28 per cent of the 15.5 million tonnes of waste we discard in landfills every year.

New Zealand does reuse and recycle glass, clean and separated cardboard and paper, certain types of plastic, and some organic wastes. So please keep recycling. But we can and must do better.

It's about shifting from a throwaway society to one in which we are more careful about how resources flow through the economy and recognise that the materials in ""waste"" are too valuable to throw away.

We can separate our economic growth from the creation and consumption of products that will pollute or damage nature. This transition to a circular approach to the economy, where products are made to be repaired and reused rather than discarded, or the materials in them are recovered at the end of their life to be reused in other products, will happen only with the right mix of incentives and investment. That's where grants from the Waste Minimisation Fund, funded by the landfill levy, can help.

The Sustainable Business Network recently produced two reports that identified how, by using circular economy principles, Auckland's economy could be up to $NZ8.8 billion better off. The reports also concluded that, despite the increase in economic activity, there would be significantly lower carbon emissions.

It's also important that consumers, large, and small become more aware of the true environmental and social costs of their purchases and become more conscious consumers who choose reused and recycled content products.

More businesses are recognising the opportunities for change. Major supermarkets and hardware chains are phasing out single use plastic bags, some supermarkets are no longer selling plastic straws or plastic-stemmed cotton buds. In June I launched the New Zealand Plastics Declaration signed by international companies Amcor, Danone, L'Oréal, Mars, PepsiCo, The Coca-Cola Company, Unilever and Nestlé and New Zealand-based businesses Foodstuffs, Countdown, New Zealand Post and Frucor Suntory.

These firms have committed to use 100 per cent reusable, recyclable or compostable packaging in their New Zealand operations by 2025 or earlier. These companies care about the environment – but they also care about public perception of their brand. Doing the correct thing is also the smart thing.

A recent HPE Financial Services study found that 69% of respondent companies have an IT sustainability strategy in place, and 79% would commit to a strategy.

HPE says the report will help businesses meet sustainability goals, support reporting requirements on environmental impact, CSR updates, and tax compliance.

HPE says that organisations are constantly expanding their IT infrastructure to store and process more information, particularly to harness the value of connectivity and data to generate business value.

By using less space, materials, and energy businesses can thrive in a resource-constrained world. This is the circular economy, HPE believes.

“A circular economy reimagines a take-make-dispose system to a circular and regenerative economy. It considers the full product lifecycle: from resource extraction, to product design and use – all the way to end-of-use management to extend product and material life and lower total cost of ownership.”

“From a customer perspective, key drivers for a circular Economy approach are new sources of business value and infrastructure efficiency. From a sustainability perspective, the need to move to a circular economy is driven by a consumption rate that is beyond the earth's ability to replenish.”

The report draws on material science and product manufacturing information to show categories of products that were refurbished, remarketed, and reintroduced into the economy, and those that were recycled.

“A circular economy commitment helps IT meet business and sustainability goals, while reducing the world’s growing e-waste problem”, comments HPE Financial Services president and CEO Irv Rothman.

A circular economy that is applied to the IT industry can drive more efficient use of products and allow businesses to retire their assets in a secure, compliant, and environmentally-responsible way. HPE’s Technology Renewal Centres (TRCs) in Andover, Massachusetts and Erskine, Scotland help extend the life of technology whenever possible, and securely and responsibly recycle materials where appropriate. In 2018, HPE Technology Renewal Centres processed over 4 million units, including HPE and non-HPE equipment. Of that, 89 per cent was refurbished and resold, and the rest was recycled in a secure and environmentally responsible way.

“Our aspiration is to help customers think about their infrastructure in new ways, build strategies to extend and extract value from what they have, and use retired assets to help fund the transition to new infrastructure,” concludes Rothman.",New Zealand,2018.12

202,Textile waste: Why good intentions are not enough,"Having spent more than 30 years in executive positions in the fashion and retail sector, I was a seemingly very settled retailer, quite happy with my life until an awareness of the issue of textile waste kicked in, and then there was no going back.

Throughout my career I was lucky to have great customers, travel to exciting places and work with incredibly talented people to produce and sell thousands of units of clothing of a broad range of styles to make people look and feel wonderful about themselves.

Yet, as I got older I started to question the sustainability and logic of our industry, and there was a voice growing louder inside of me wondering if I was doing the right thing.

I was participating in a sector that promotes the designing, buying and selling of garments we know will rapidly be marked down, quickly disposed of and ultimately become landfill. Once I understood that, I knew there needed to be change and innovation.

The retail sector is now in a cycle where it is trying to compete with the growth and shift to online shopping and the growth of fast fashion players flooding the market with clothing, which is both low in quality and price.

As I worked with a number of retail charity organisations, I grew more aware of the ever-increasing levels of donations of fast fashion items, which they couldn’t sell because of the sheer volume and poorer quality.
• Australians on average buy 27kg of textiles (clothing, etc) annually.
• We waste on average 23kg of textiles per year per person, second only to the US.
• Australians wear a garment an average of six times before disposing of it – either by putting it in the rubbish or donating it to charity stores.
• Charities are generally only able to sell 15-20 per cent of donated clothing.
• Australia exported 94,000 tonnes of textile waste in 2016-17 and this is growing annually.

I became more engaged and involved in the “circular economy” debate and had the pleasure of meeting many intelligent and well-intentioned people and organisations looking to be a part of the circular economy, a movement to increase the reuse and recycling of raw materials, including textiles, rather than depositing them in landfill.

The challenge facing the retail sector is twofold. Firstly, it needs to continue to engage with a much broader audience than itself and ensure it appeals to all consumers in a practical and meaningful way. Secondly, it needs to present business models which drive real change, supporting the development of the circular economy.

Simply talking about change will not drive it, actions are needed and scale solutions are required.

The recent policy decision by China to no longer accept contaminated waste from Australia has caused an upheaval in the publicly visible areas of waste collection and management, as their traditional market is now effectively shut.

This has caused significant issues at a state level regarding the collection and storage of plastic, glass, and cardboard and significant financial subsidies to help with the recycling of this waste.

Textile waste still has not hit the radar of many governments, even the quality of data of textile waste collected or sent to landfill is not consistently measured by government bodies making policy development and implementation difficult when the scale of problem is not even visible.

The public perception of textile waste is also complicated by our relationship with our clothing. We know plastic does harm if in the ocean, so we recycle plastic bottles without thinking, but we dispose of our textile waste by donating it ‘guilt-free’ to charity stores.

Clothing, just as much as plastic bottles, needs to be reused or recycled into fibres, as charitable donations merely delay landfill, they do not stop it.

There is now technology available in Australia, allowing textiles to be recycled into fibres. For this to happen at scale, we need to see government initially support this process and there to be increased public and consumer awareness of the need to do so. Then there will be real change.
