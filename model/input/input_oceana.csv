33,The shift from a throwaway society to a more circular economy,"Associate Environment Minister Eugenie Sage: ""It's about shifting from a throwaway society to one in which we are more careful about how resources flow through the economy"".

OPINION: Recently a small male pilot whale washed ashore on a beach in southern Thailand. It died of starvation after swallowing 80 plastic shopping bags. One of the finalists in this year's International Wildlife Photographer competition shows a tiny seahorse latched onto a plastic-stemmed cotton bud.

Scientists estimate there are more than 150 million tonnes of plastics in the ocean today. If nothing changes, then it is projected that plastic in oceans will weigh more than all the fish that live in them by 2050.

As associate minister for the environment with responsibility for waste, it's my job to make sure New Zealand does its share to clean up our act when it comes to plastic pollution.

Recently Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and I announced the Government's plan to phase out single-use plastic bags. At the weekend I announced a work programme to tackle the tougher problems associated with the mountains of waste we produce.

The first task is to expand the number of landfills the waste disposal levy applies to. New Zealand has more than 420 known landfills, and the levy applies to only 11 per cent of them – largely the metropolitan landfills accepting household waste – and it applies to only an estimated 30 per cent of the waste stream.

According to surveys done in Auckland, construction and demolition waste accounts for about 85 per cent of the waste stream. Yet the levy applies to very few landfills where this material ends up. The levy needs to be extended to level the playing field across different types of waste and provide an incentive to encourage materials recovery and divert waste from landfill. We'll also consider whether the levy rate should be increased, consult the public and ensure the costs are reasonable.

Revenue from the landfill levy will be recycled to help councils, progressive businesses and community organisations minimise and divert waste from landfills. It will increase the ability of the Waste Minimisation Fund to invest in activities that support reduction, recovery, reuse, remanufacturing, repurposing, recycling and composting. Our waste plan will help create more jobs in the recycling and materials recovery sectors.

The second and long-overdue task is to improve the data and information available on waste. We lack a full national picture of what is going to landfill, and what is being recovered or recycled. Knowing this is critical if we are to make informed decisions.

The third big change is to develop and implement mandatory product stewardship schemes, starting with tyres, so that everyone helps take responsibility for the waste they create.

We have good law in New Zealand in the Waste Minimisation Act 2008, but have failed over the past decade to use the opportunities it provides to identify priority products and create mandatory stewardship schemes for them.

Canada has 94 product categories covered by legislated schemes where producers, retailers and consumers of products all share in the costs of dealing with those products at the end of their life and reduce waste to landfill. New Zealand has only 15 schemes, all of them voluntary, with varying levels of coverage.

I have asked ministry experts to work with businesses and the tyre sector to develop a mandatory product stewardship scheme to prevent end-of-life tyres ending up in stockpiles and posing fire and environmental risks or being illegally dumped. Unlike most other OECD countries, we have no pricing incentives to fund effective tyre take-back schemes, improved management or domestic tyre recycling.

I have also asked officials to resume work on developing more mandatory product stewardship schemes to deal with other key waste streams such as e-waste (starting with lithium batteries), and agrichemical containers. This will build on the great work of the AgRecovery Scheme.

New Zealand is feeling the effects of the Chinese Government's decision to close its borders to mixed recyclables so that China is no longer a dumping ground for the world's rubbish. China's decision creates both challenges and opportunities.

The Ministry for the Environment has created a taskforce dedicated to leading the response to this challenge, with an external working group with representatives from councils and industry to provide independent advice. It's due to report back in the next two months.

We currently recycle just 28 per cent of the 15.5 million tonnes of waste we discard in landfills every year.

New Zealand does reuse and recycle glass, clean and separated cardboard and paper, certain types of plastic, and some organic wastes. So please keep recycling. But we can and must do better.

It's about shifting from a throwaway society to one in which we are more careful about how resources flow through the economy and recognise that the materials in ""waste"" are too valuable to throw away.

We can separate our economic growth from the creation and consumption of products that will pollute or damage nature. This transition to a circular approach to the economy, where products are made to be repaired and reused rather than discarded, or the materials in them are recovered at the end of their life to be reused in other products, will happen only with the right mix of incentives and investment. That's where grants from the Waste Minimisation Fund, funded by the landfill levy, can help.

The Sustainable Business Network recently produced two reports that identified how, by using circular economy principles, Auckland's economy could be up to $NZ8.8 billion better off. The reports also concluded that, despite the increase in economic activity, there would be significantly lower carbon emissions.

It's also important that consumers, large, and small become more aware of the true environmental and social costs of their purchases and become more conscious consumers who choose reused and recycled content products.

More businesses are recognising the opportunities for change. Major supermarkets and hardware chains are phasing out single use plastic bags, some supermarkets are no longer selling plastic straws or plastic-stemmed cotton buds. In June I launched the New Zealand Plastics Declaration signed by international companies Amcor, Danone, L'Oréal, Mars, PepsiCo, The Coca-Cola Company, Unilever and Nestlé and New Zealand-based businesses Foodstuffs, Countdown, New Zealand Post and Frucor Suntory.

These firms have committed to use 100 per cent reusable, recyclable or compostable packaging in their New Zealand operations by 2025 or earlier. These companies care about the environment – but they also care about public perception of their brand. Doing the correct thing is also the smart thing.

56,Nestlé supports global commitment to reduce plastic waste | Food & Beverage,"Nestlé has joined forces with other businesses and governments in signing the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, known as the Global Commitment, at the Our Ocean Conference in Bali, Indonesia.

The Global Commitment is an initiative of The Ellen MacArthur Foundation and UN Environment.

It aims to rethink the future of plastics by applying the principles of circular economy, in which plastics never become waste.

The Global Commitment represents a framework to work collectively on solutions that address the root causes of plastics waste and pollution.

READ: Nestlé pledges increase in recycled plastics in the European Union

Nestlé CEO Mark Schneider said the Global Commitment is a step-change that is urgently needed in order to move from a linear to a circular economy.

“We want to act and lead by example. We will do our part to ensure that none of our packaging, including plastics, ends up in the natural environment,” said Schneider.

Nestlé recognises the need for preventing packaging material ending up as waste.

This is the rationale behind the company’s goal to make 100 per cent of its packaging recyclable or reusable by 2025.

To achieve this goal, Nestlé has embarked on several research and development projects.

One of them is the NaturAll Bottle Alliance, which aims to develop 100 per cent bio-based PET to be used for its water business.

Nestlé also plays a role in the development of well-functioning collection, sorting and recycling schemes across the countries where it operates.",Australia,2018.10

81,Circular economy 2.0 – ready for download,"The 2018 World Circular Economy Forum in Yokohama last week offered some great ideas for Australia’s ”circular economy 2.0”, according to Open Cities chief executive officer Lisa McLean, but so far only the most forward-thinking companies have caught on, she says.

If you thought the circular economy was a hippie fad, it’s time to google the definition and get ready for the transition.

The circular economy is now valued at 1.8 trillion euros by 2030 in Europe alone. Millions of people and tens of thousands of businesses are now participating in this innovative circular economic approach.

Rapid advancements in technology and innovation are propelling this economic transition, along with the obvious fact that earth will run out of resources to meet the current needs of our growing human population – anticipated to exceed 9.8 billion by 2050.

While leading and innovative Australian businesses are part of this transition a lot more work needs to be done right now for us to secure our place in the global circular economy 2.0.

Resources are getting too expensive, and the products created are fast becoming waste items that are not good for us or the environment.

Just last week, we found out that plastics are now officially inside humans. Not such a surprise as they have been detected in fish, marine life and salt. But now we know for sure that if they are not already inside us, they will be soon, and they may also be the cause of illnesses and even infertility.

If we were ever going to transition away from our linear throw-away economy and rethink the products we manufacture and the way we use them, now would be a good time.

Circularity economics is about decoupling population growth from resource use – ensuring the wellbeing of people does not rely on how much of our natural resources we consume.

It provides a mechanism for resource efficiency, sustainable growth and carbon elimination by promoting new business models that give humans what we really need to survive and be happy. For example, I don’t really want a light bulb – what I need is light. I don’t always want a car, but I need mobility. I definitely don’t want plastic waste, but I need food and water.

Circular economy doesn’t only generate savings for the environment, it makes economic sense by increasing competitiveness. The savings of production have been estimated in the EU alone to be to 600 billion euros – a huge increase in competitiveness, with greenhouse gas savings of around 50 per cent. New sectors, jobs and businesses are being created like battery recycling worth 400 to 500 million euros annually -–a massive increase over the past five years.

Banks are now looking to invest in the circular economy because of the new revenue streams and long-term risk mitigation benefits of circular businesses. These businesses reflect the fact that consumer demand is changing from owning to using. New ownership models are now based on sharing and prosuming – the ability to both produce and consume services.

Europe (led by Finland), Japan, China and some Canadian and US cities are now leading the transition. They are catalysing new markets and allowing people to recycle their waste over and over again in a way that extends the value chain, giving more people and businesses a chance to participate.

Starting with waste recycling, these markets are extending to utility and mobility services, enabling people to generate their own renewable energy and sell spare capacity, recycle water, and share mobility to avoid the second largest household expense of a car. The mobility revolution is occurring rapidly and globally as more people chose mobility as a service over car ownership.

Maximising resource life span and use within the value chain to use resources for longer while minimising waste, is proving to be a successful way to drive job creation, productivity, higher efficiency and innovation.

Innovative businesses already understand the impact of resource consumption and their rising costs is a significant risk that cannot be ignored. So, they are responsibly and cleverly designing business models that both avoid these risks and redefine the benefit.

Australia needs to focus on transitioning and fast – new businesses can’t compete fairly without level playing fields, without better regulation. These new businesses, along with leading councils, are pushing for better regulation that will open markets to improved sustainable services and products based on circular economics.

There is no doubt policy targets and changes in regulation are the first requirements of this economic transition. Fair policies that are consistent and reliable will ensure we can realise the economic benefits. Tariff structures that recognise circularity and are not based on linear externalities need to be developed not just in the waste sectors, but in water, energy, mobility and telco.

All Australians need to be included. Businesses that have been good corporate citizens need to be supported in the transition, and new circular business models currently shut out need to be let into the market.

It’s great to see NSW moving forward with this critical economic policy thinking, this week releasing its first draft Circular Economy policy document. It’s a unique opportunity to bring together government with Circular Economy industry and consumer leaders in a coalition that informs Australia’s transition.

As we make this transition, one thing is certain: Circular economic thinking is here to stay and is already driving our markets, our products and services – that’s a significant opportunity for Australians.

111,The circular economy: an explainer | APO,"There has been considerable concern in Australia in recent years about recycling efforts, and what happens to our products once they are recycled. This was brought into focus by China’s decision to ban the import of foreign waste from January 2018. Australia exports recyclable material to over 100 countries; the three main categories of which are metals, paper and cardboard, and plastics. In 2016–17, Australia exported some 4.23 mega tonnes of recycled materials, a considerable amount of which went to China. Therefore, the decision made by China to ban the import of foreign waste has a direct impact on recycling and waste management practices in Australia.

One idea put forward in response to the issue of recycling and waste management is of the transition to a circular economy. Essentially, the objective of a circular economy is to maximise value at each point in a product’s life. A circular economy seeks to close industrial loops and to turn outputs from one manufacturer into inputs for another and, in doing so, reduce the consumption of virgin materials and the generation of waste.

The Victorian government has also recently signalled its support for the creation of a circular economy, as have the governments of South Australia and New South Wales.

So what is the circular economy, exactly? This explainer provides an overview of the circular economy concept, what it looks like and why it’s being talked about. It also discusses recent research and developments in the circular economy space, and some of the challenges that may arise in its implementation. Additionally, it includes a number of examples from other jurisdictions where circular initiatives are being realised, and considers developments taking place in Australia.",Australia,2018.10
134,From the mayor’s desk,"General Manager Coralie Nichols and I attended the Hunter JO meeting in Parliament House this week. The meeting was in Sydney to coincide with the sitting of Parliament, which gives the member councils the opportunity to meet with ministers or their advisors. We had several guest speakers updating us on various topics, including information on regional events opportunities, green bonds as an alternative source of infrastructure funding, Hunter Valley Flood Mitigation Scheme and State Government/Joint Organisation funding process. We were also updated on the Greater Newcastle Metropolitan Plan. The Hunter JO has a standing committee comprising the mayors of the five Lower Hunter local government areas. The GM and I met with Minister of Roads, Maritime and Freight, Melinda Pavey, our State local member for the Upper Hunter, Michael Johnsen, and the Director Hunter Region, Regional and State Roads and Maritime Service, Anna Zycki, to discuss road and infrastructure funding for Dungog Shire. The Minister certainly appeared to be compelled by our argument, particularly around the funding of repair work to Brig O’ Johnson Bridge at Clarence Town, which will not result in an improved outcome for our residents. We reiterated our invitation to visit the Dungog Shire to see firsthand the problems that our weight loaded bridges in particular cause farmers and other businesses. I would like to thank the GM for her considerable input into this meeting. I have asked Michael Johnsen for a follow-up meeting to discuss his advocacy on our behalf with the minister regarding roads and bridges funding. The committee met to determine the categories for next year’s Australia Day Awards, and to finalise the arrangements for the day’s activities. I will update you on the categories in the next couple of weeks, once we have consensus. We will definitely have a citizen of the year and junior citizen of the year, so please consider who you would like to see nominated. The GM and I are in Albury to attend the annual LGNSW Conference. The conference has several guest speakers, including the Premier, the Minister for Local Government, the Federal Shadow Minister for Local Government and the State Shadow Minister for Local Government. Delegates vote on advocacy priorities and policies for LGNSW, the peak representative body of the Local Government Sector. There will be presentations on smart city and town technology and on recycling options for NSW LGAs, and updates on legal responsibilities for elected members and on building capabilities.

The forum is to introduce the concept of the Hunter Valley becoming the first green innovation region in Australia as we move away from a carbon-intensive economy, through investment in renewable energy, agri-food, green products and design, environmental management and bio-technology. These concepts are well established in Europe and are based around the “circular economy”, with more recycling and reuse, and the bio-economy, based on the conversion of biomass into value-added products, such as food and pharmaceuticals, as well as bioenergy.",Australia,2018.10
144,NSW moves to boost recycling industry,"The NSW Government has released its draft Circular Economic Policy, but the local government and waste and recycling sectors say the government needs to do more.

It comes as the Federal Government works with the states and territories on an updated national waste policy incorporating circular economy principles, which the waste and recycling industries have been lobbying for throughout this year.

Announcing the draft policy on Monday, NSW Environment Minister Gabrielle Upton said the new approach was a better way of managing the state’s waste and resources.

“Achieving a circular economy will minimise our waste, reduce our impact on the environment and is an opportunity to boost the NSW economy,” she said.

“It’s an antidote to the current ‘linear economy’, where we make things, use them and then throw them away.”

Minister Upton said “having a circular economy provides a better operating environment for the recycling industry, as well as manufacturers, retailers and consumers. It will encourage innovation and create jobs.”

But peak bodies representing the waste and recycling sectors have criticised the NSW Government’s approach on the issue.

The Waste Management Association of Australia yesterday slammed the government’s response to a state parliamentary inquiry into technology deriving energy from waste, saying its lack of leadership was leading to frustration and delays.

The WMAA wants greater funding from the state’s current landfil levy returned to industry to incentivise landfill diversion, and for the stalled Waste and Resource Recovery Infrastructure Strategy to be completed.

Similarly, the Australian Council of Recycling has criticised the NSW Government’s use of the funds raised by its waste levy.

The “vast majority” of the $727 million collected last year through the waste disposal levy went to consolidated revenue – while the levy’s stated goal is to reduce landfill, ACOR chief Pete Shmigel told a sustainable cities conference last week.

On Tuesday the state’s local government sector also called on the NSW Government to divert the levy funds into waste management and recycling.

Local Government NSW’s Save Our Recycling Campaign, launched at the peak’s annual conference in Albury, calls on the State Government to re-invest the $727 million it collects from the waste levy each year in waste management and recycling.

LGNSW president Linda Scott said the moves to a circular economy didn’t need to involve any new costs on residents or businesses.

“A new statewide approach to recycling must be funded by the $727 million the state government currently collects through the Waste Levy, around $300 million of which comes from local government,” she said.

“At present, only 18 per cent of that $300 million is reinvested in recycling and waste management, with the rest disappearing into the government’s coffers. Local government is not asking for more money, just for the money already raised as the Waste Levy to be used where communities expect: on better recycling and waste management,” she said.

NSW is currently among the poorer performing states for resource recovery, according to the latest National Waste Report. It has a waste recovery rate of 65 per cent, putting it below Victoria (69 per cent), the ACT (75 per cent) and South Australia (80 per cent).

Minister Upton said the NSW Government is also working with the Commonwealth on the development of national circular economy principles.

Commonwealth and state ministers have committed to updating the national waste policy by the end of the year.

Australia would reduce its total waste by 10 per cent per capita by 2030 under the latest proposals for the updated national waste policy.

The proposals would also mandate 30 per cent recycled content across all goods and infrastructure procurement and diverting half the organic waste currently sent to landfill by 2030.

179,Visit your local Community Recycling Centre this weekend,"It’s recycling week, and to celebrate we're doing more than just looking at what goes in our recycling bins.

What do you do with furniture left over from your big spring clean? And how about items that can’t go in your kerbside recycling?

Chances are you can drop off items like that at one of the five community recycling centres around Auckland, facilities where residents can take their unwanted items and materials for reuse and recycling.

Most of the centres have shops on-site that sell usable household and building materials, so there are always some great finds.

Auckland Council plans to create a network of 12 community recycling centres across Auckland by 2024, as per the Waste Management and Minimisation Plan.

The Community Recycling Centres are run in partnership with community organisations and Auckland Council to reduce waste to landfill by reusing, re-purposing and recycling as much as possible.

Generally, the centres will accept the following items, but make sure to check with each one before you go:
• green waste and general rubbish (some sites only).

Do you have a community recycling centre near you? Read on to learn about the unique features of our current centres.

The Devonport site is a source of local pride, being the first recycling depot in the country and opening for the first time more than 40 years ago.

It has gone through different phases throughout the years up until recently when Auckland Council re-established the site as a Community Recycling Centre.

Now known as the Devonport Community Recycling Centre, it’s run by Global Action Plan Oceania, a registered environmental charity whose objective is to divert waste from landfill and provide sustainable new jobs and volunteer opportunities for the community.

It is also the first community recycling centre to have a circular economy landscape supplies yard, where they stock over 200 tonnes of landscaping material made from waste products.

Proceeds from the shop on site from the sale of reusable and upcycled goods from the shop on-site are invested back into the centre and the local community.

The Helensville Community Recycling Centre is run by Helensville Enterprises Trust, a local community trust. They focus on creating a circular economy, community empowerment, and jobs for local people.

They recently completed a pilot house deconstruction in partnership with Envision NZ, where they were able to divert more than 87 per cent of the materials from landfill.

Find your next treasure at their on-site op shop.

The Tipping Point sits within the Waitakere Transfer Station, the only transfer station owned and operated by Auckland Council. It is run by the McLaren Park Henderson South (MPHS) Community Trust, a local community organisation which runs diverse projects and programmes including:

The Tipping Point invests a large amount of the proceeds from the shop and yard back into the local community, supporting these initiatives.

The Waitakere Community Recycling Centre is part of the larger council-run transfer station which also includes an education centre, the Zero Waste Zone.

This centre is run by Waiuku Zero Waste a local community organisation which focuses on reducing waste to landfill and creating employment opportunities for the community.

Auckland Council is currently developing a new building on site, which will enable the centre to increase their services to include education. They are looking forward to being able to accommodate large groups from the community and provide education on how to achieve zero waste.

The centre will run repair workshops and demonstrations about responsible recycling, as well as education about sustainability, circular economy, composting and upcycling.

Items can be purchased from the Waiuku Junktion shop during opening hours.

This Stanmore Bay site opened in 2017 and is a smaller scale facility focused on recycling. Whangaparāoa Community Recycling Centre is run by Hibiscus Coast Zero Waste, a social enterprise that is committed to zero waste and sustainability.

296,A new waste approach,"A bench seat made entirely from recycled plastics has signalled a new approach to managing waste for Dungog Shire Council. The council is taking a “circular economy” approach to waste disposal where recyclable waste is processed into a usable product rather than being landfilled. “In this example, a bench seat has been manufactured from soft plastics collected from the communities of Dungog Shire, representing the closing of the resource energy loop and reducing the loss of a resource,” said Council’s Manager of Environmental Services Paul Minett . “The seat consumed 62kg of waste plastics or the equivalent of 15500 plastic bags.” The Council, in partnership with Plastic Police and community group Boomerang Bags started its soft plastics recycling project 18 months ago. “One of the biggest issues facing waste management in Australia is finding sustainable end markets for recyclable materials,” Mr Minett said. “In recent times, this issue has been exposed by the China Sword Policy, which saw the option of China as a receiver of Australia’s recyclable waste severely restricted. Without export markets such as China, there is a need for the Australian recycling and waste industry to look to internal solutions and these solutions will take time to develop. A local industry that processes waste plastics into furniture is an example of this.” Since June 2017 the Council has delivered more than 10 tonnes of soft plastics to the Plastic Police. Along with the furniture manufacturer, the plastics have also been used in a successful trial of a road built with soft plastics and glass at Engadine. “Whilst Dungog Shire has been proactive in developing circular economy projects through its partnership with Plastics Police, the impacts of the China Sword crisis has led to all levels of government revisiting past practices and policies to support a sustainable recycling industry in Australia and remove the reliance on those diminishing overseas options,” Mr Minett said. Soft plastics drop off locations are at Dungog Waste Management Facility, Council administration centre, Dungog Library, Shaws Café and Bakery in Clarence Town and Twin Rivers Cafe in Gresford.

308,"Plastic, glass paves the way for ?greener? roads","Green Roads PolyPave, which has been developed by leading recycled aggregates producer Alex Fraser Group, was recently used in a resurfacing project in Richmond’s Stanley and Margaret streets, and will be rolled out in other areas.

A total of 7300 two-litre plastic bottles and 55,000 glass bottles was used in the pavement of these two roads. That is the equivalent of 1500 wheelie bins in the annual kerbside recycling collection of Stanley Street.

{{quote-A:R-W:275-I:2-Q:“Laboratory test results showed increased fatigue life, improved asphalt rut resistance, increased asphalt modulus/stiffness, and a better resistance to moisture ingress.” -who:Brendan Camilleri, Asphalt General Manager, Alex Fraser Group}}The City of Yarra has engaged Alex Fraser to repair and repave several more streets in the coming weeks, calling for an additional 1000 tonnes of the sustainable asphalt. This will save another 25,000 plastic bottles from ending up in landfill.

Alex Fraser managing director Peter Murphy said PolyPave was a prime example of how a circular economy could be achieved, with government, industry and community working together to build sustainable infrastructure with recycled materials.

“The City of Yarra’s progressive approach to the use of sustainable material is an excellent illustration of how local councils can proactively reuse the waste generated in their communities to build and maintain their cities,” Murphy said.

He added that this product could reduce the usual carbon footprint of road manufacture by up to 65 per cent.

Alex Fraser’s asphalt general manager Brendan Camilleri told Quarry Polypave can be used on all roads and is not restricted to roads where traffic loading is light.

“We are confident PolyPave will perform well on heavily trafficked roads,” said Camilleri, adding that laboratory test results showed an increase in nearly all mix performance and durability parameters.

Commenting on the anticipated life cycle of a road constructed with PolyPave, Camilleri said pavement life was dependent on individual operating conditions, but he did not foresee any lifecycle drop using Polypave.

He said research and development behind the product had ensured there was no slipperiness/loss of skid resistance, loss of strength or shape and the percentage inputted of the recycled plastic ensured the asphalt mix properties were not affected.

Camilleri said Alex Fraser’s innovative asphalt plant enabled his team to develop a wide range of asphalt mixes.

“Depending on the mix design, PolyPave is estimated to reduce carbon emissions by over 65 per cent. We can achieve an estimated saving of 10.6 kilograms per tonne of carbon emissions,” Camilleri said.

Camilleri said PolyPave was less sensitive to increased pavement temperatures because the recycled plastic utilised had a higher softening point temperature than that of the bitumen binder used in the asphalt mix.

“[Recycled plastic] being dissolved and dissipated throughout binder, it will increase the softening point temperature of the asphalt mix,” he added.

Camilleri said PolyPave also reduced ultraviolet radiation damage, as the recycled plastic was less susceptible to UV damage than the traditional binder.

Alex Fraser’s asphalt crews pave around 1000 km of roads each year but this is first time they have used plastic – high density polyethylene.

Camilleri said the benefits of plastic are:
• Increased fatigue life.
• Improved asphalt rut resistance.
• Increased asphalt modulus/stiffness.
• Increased wet tensile strength.
• Reduced ultraviolet radiation damage.
• Less sensitive to increased pavement temperature.

“Laboratory test results showed increased fatigue life, improved asphalt rut resistance, increased asphalt modulus/stiffness, and a better resistance to moisture ingress,” Camilleri said, adding that Alex Fraser was “committed to developing a wide range of sustainable asphalt mixes and construction materials”.

316,New Zealand faces up to its plastic problem,"Tonnes upon tonnes of plastic waste with nowhere to go — there’s no easy solution, but for one group of Kiwi businesses, simply doing nothing was not an option.

Until earlier this year, even the most diligent recyclers may not have given much thought to what happens to that plastic bottle after it’s been deposited in the correct bin and taken away by the big truck.

But China’s recent decision to stop accepting discarded plastic from other countries brought an issue that many had been ignorant of into sharp relief. Since 1992, the country had bought 45% of the world’s plastic waste and recycled it into new products, but instituted a ban on January 1 this year, citing local environmental concerns. New Zealand had been sending 15 million kilograms of waste to China a year, mainly mixed paper and mixed plastics.

While the move is undeniably worrying — researchers have calculated that by 2030, the ban may leave 111 million tonnes of plastic waste with nowhere to go — an upside is it’s forcing people to take action.

“We’ve been moving plastic waste issues out of our backyard and into someone else’s,” says James Griffin of the Sustainable Business Network (SBN). “Now there’s a key focus to actually sort it out ourselves and take responsibility for our own waste.”

SBN’s Circular Economy Accelerator is spearheading a study into New Zealand’s plastic packaging system, backed by 10 businesses: Freedom Farms, Bluebird Foods, Coca-Cola Amatil (NZ), Countdown, Earthwise, ecostore, Lewis Road Creamery, My Food Bag, New Zealand King Salmon and New Zealand Post.

“We’ve done qualitative research across importers, packaging manufacturers, brands, retailers, right through to the end-of-life processes, to understand what are the key things that need to happen to enable a more circular economy of plastic,” says Griffin.

A circular economy is an alternative to the traditional “take, make, dispose” linear economy in which resources are kept for as long as possible, maximum value is extracted from them and at the end of their life, they’re recovered and regenerated.

“Businesses are realising that because we’ve been so entrenched in how we’re using plastic packaging — because it’s been so cheap and does such a good job — we haven’t got the end-of-life systems,” says Griffin.

The aim is to create a “closed loop” system for plastics, says Griffin, where it can be reused constantly without leakage into the environment. This requires a fundamental shift in approach, not simply more recycling.

While the official report isn’t being released until the end of October, some of the study’s findings will be no surprise. Where possible, businesses need to use less plastic in packaging and crucially, minimise the types of plastic they’re using, keeping to either PTE (no 1) or HDPE (no 2). “All the rest are problematic in the current scenario,” says Griffin.

But of course, minimising plastic is a lot easier in some areas than others. While taking our reusable bags to the supermarket instead of using single-use plastic ones isn’t too much of a stretch for most of us, what about scenarios where plastic is necessary for food safety and prolonging shelf life?

“The whole of the life cycle of the product, including the packaging, needs to be looked at,” says Griffin. “Certain plastic packaging may be extending the life of the product, or it may be keeping it sterile, so to discount that packaging because it’s plastic may not be the best course of action.”

Plastic is lightweight, relatively cheap to produce and does a pretty good job, which is why it’s everywhere. “There are alternatives that could deliver as well as plastic in certain situations, but often the price is quite different,” says Griffin. “So the question is who foots the bill — are customers willing to pay more?”

Food safety is particularly important with products like bacon, ham, pork and chicken — Freedom Farms’ bread and butter — and currently, there’s no magical solution to plastic packaging, the company says.

“The reasons we need to address the amount of waste created are really clear, but when it came time to decide what action to take, things aren’t as straightforward,” says Hilary Pearson of Freedom Farms.

“The conversations we’ve had with customers centre around a couple of main ideas: less rubbish to landfill, without compromising on food safety or creating more food waste,” says Pearson.

Soft plastics, such as those used for Freedom Farms’ bacon and ham, can be recycled, but washing the plastic in hot soapy water, leaving it to dry and then taking it to the soft plastic recycling bins at supermarkets is a big ask for many consumers. Similarly, the number of New Zealanders willing and able to manage “home”-compostable packaging is unknown, and plenty of confusion exists around the best way to manage biodegradable or compostable products.

Freedom Farms’ chicken trays are made from recyclable PET plastic from Flight Plastics, and the company is in the process of transitioning its sausage trays to the material as well. Flight opened New Zealand’s first integrated PET recycling and manufacturing facility at its Wellington plant last year.

“Opportunities like Flight Plastics developing are fantastic,” says Pearson, “because we’re making use of consumer behaviour that already exists. Putting a soft drink bottle in the curb-side recycling bin is pretty habitual,, so rinsing a meat tray and putting that in the bin isn’t asking a lot. It’s a nationwide simple solution, and creates that circular flow of resources that makes it sustainable. But it remains to be seen whether it can become the norm for soft plastics too.”

While a change in consumer mindset is certainly required, with the status quo, it’s little surprise that many of us put recycling in the too-hard basket. Collection criteria differs in different regions — something you can put in your council recycling bin in Auckland may not be accepted in Wellington, for example.

“It’s very confusing for customers, and it’s an issue for brands to put specific guidelines on their packaging when it differs across the country,” says Griffin. “The need for standardised labelling and a more standardised collection process is really clear.

“Australia has a national labelling system, as does the UK, and there’s work under way looking at adapting the Australian system for New Zealand,” says Griffin.

Conservation minister Eugenie Sage set up a government taskforce in response to the Chinese plastic ban in May, which is due to report back to the minister later this month.

In a statement, Sage said that over the medium to long term, government may set national recycling standards, but investing in on-shore processing and reducing the waste New Zealand generates is the main aim.

The ideal scenario, says Griffin, is that the recycling process become self-funding. “The idea is that the revenue received from recycled plastics which is then on-sold to manufacturers pays for the processing,” says Griffin. At the moment it’s really only a certain amount of plastics that are generating an economic return.”

But to do that, the quality of the plastics that are being recycled needs to improve, as does the level of recycling happening.

“Many brands are wanting to make the right decisions about their packing innovation,” says Griffin, “but it’s complicated — no one organisation can solve it on their own.

“We’re trying to bring organisations together and enable some support for the more systemic changes that need to happen.”",New Zealand,2018.10
355,No wonder we are losing the war on waste,"It takes longer to win planning approval for a new recycling facility in NSW than it does to approve a new mine. And anecdotal experience suggests it takes up to twice as long as in Victoria or Queensland. Little wonder many believe we are losing the war on waste.

The lengthy assessment process is at odds with the growing pressure to develop new recycling and other waste infrastructure in the Sydney basin in response to shrinking export markets for recycled materials, dwindling landfill space and the early 2019 closure of our exporting of waste to Queensland.

Unpublished research by the Waste Management Association of Australia has found that for the period 2014 – 2017, the average time to secure approval for large, ""state significant"" waste infrastructure projects was almost two years.

Follow up analysis of the 10 most recently determined state significant waste projects confirmed further slippage in approval timeframes. Arcadis Australia found on average it took more than 25 months from lodgment of preliminary environmental assessment documentation to final approval.",Australia,2018.10
399,"iTWire - HPE makes pathway from old tech to new, via circular economy","Global business technology firm Hewlett Packard Enterprise says it wants to help you achieve hybrid cloud so much, it will even buy your ageing in-house servers and provide you consumption-based billing on new gear, with an RoI of five months.

The proposition is the combination of two HPE services named GreenLake and HPEFS, or HPE Financial Services.

“If you have workloads that can use public cloud then you should,” says Flynn Maloy, vice-president, Marketing, HPE Pointnext, Enterprise Group. “For those workloads that can’t, you should get cloud economics.”

By “cloud economics”, Maloy refers to the great promise of the cloud — someone else will look after it, you pay for what you use, you can scale — and contract as needed, and your IT staff are freed from running machines to focusing on business problems.

For a start-up that’s tremendous. For the rest of us with a plethora of old servers running legacy applications, it’s not so easy. This is the problem HPE wants to solve, Flynn says.

“The GreenLake brand launched about a year ago as a consumption business. We see ourselves as pioneers in the consumption space. HPE has all this great technology but instead of customers buying it up-front or leasing it we wanted to replicate the public cloud experience on-premise. Pay for what you use and everything else is taken care of – servers, patching, and the rest. We wanted to create that experience with GreenLake,” he said. “We’re really proud of it.”

In fact, Maloy explains, GreenLake now has more than US$3 billion of equipment under contract, and the business is growing 50% per year on a nine-digit number as it is.

So, HPE GreenLake is the service which will supply, install and maintain a data centre in your own environment. You will literally only pay for what you use, meaning you save costs straight away by shutting down unused servers at night. If you require greater capacity, HPE will physically install more gear for you. If you expect your usage to reduce, they’ll take parts away. It’s not as instantaneous as the public cloud, of course, but it provides business with an on-premise data centre and zero effort on labour costs to administer the gear. “Your people can be more efficient. Our customers say they love this the most,” Maloy says.

When taking up GreenLake, HPE will work with you to identify the workloads you plan to run and consider the history and the variability. They will install the technology they think you need plus 20% on top. “We use HPE DataCentre Care to run it,” Maloy says, “and every hour on the hour we measure how much is used. We charge for what’s used and every two weeks check in with you for capacity planning.”

The other part of HPE’s value proposition is HPE Financial Services who says it will buy your existing servers from you. This is what HPE refers to as the “circular economy,” seeking to reduce waste and maximise reuse of equipment. The company claims it still refurbishes and sells VAX components every week, so it is confident it has a use for your old ProLiant.

Quite literally — and iTWire asked again to be sure — HPE is saying if you have existing on-premise equipment you manage, and you wish to move to newer equipment, still on-premise, but managed by someone else and with no upfront outlay and billing only on usage, then they will help you in this journey.

“You can get a return on investment within five months,” Maloy said, adding HPE regularly sees over-capacity savings of 40%.

The actual number will depend on how good you are at forecasting, in that your savings may even be larger if your company over-provisioned the number of servers it needed when purchasing the original gear.

“GreenLake stands out from our competition,” Maloy said, “because we see consumption using public cloud as the benchmark. We see it as a rental. With our competitors, they offer 12 decreasing monthly payments. You save some over-capacity but in their example, you still have to buy tech, stand it up, manage it, patch it, and so on. When you go to the public cloud you don’t do that.”

GreenLake is a component of HPE’s Pointnext brand, which is the new name for its all-in-one services division. Previously, Maloy explains, HPE had services in many different areas of the business but under Pointnext they are joined into one 25,000 person organisation.

HPE Pointnext offers advisory consulting services, professional services and operational services. Greenlake fits into the operational services area and runs your on-premise data centre 24x7x365.",Australia,-via-circular-economy.htm
423,"After plastic bags, what's next? Government tackles 'circular economy'","Associate Minister for the Environment Eugenie Sage discusses plans to ban single-use plastic bags. (Video first published in December 2018)

As single-use plastic bags get their marching orders, the Government is turning its attention to the design of goods to try and reduce waste at its very creation.

Associate Environment Minister Eugenie Sage said on Monday the Environment Ministry planned to present research early next year on the ""circular economy"" and how it might work in New Zealand.

A report is also due out this week from the Sustainable Business Network illustrating the ways New Zealand could change shift to a circular economy.

A circular economy was a complete shift away from the current disposable culture, she said.

 * Plastic bags battle won but the war against non-recyclables far from over

 * Urgent calls for plastics ban, as recycling and composting plants run out of space

 * NZ's first PET plastic processing plant opens

Products were designed that ""so at the end of its life, the materials can be recovered and remade into other products, and kept circulating, or the product has a very long life and easily repaired.""

""It's right across the board, thinking much more carefully about what we consume, and manufacturers and retailers looking up the supply chain and being on the sustainability journey in terms of how products are manufactured.""

Last week's decision to ban single-use plastic bags within six months comes as recycling mounts up around the country, following China's decision to limit the amount of plastic and paper it receives for recycling.

Sage said the Government and business world had to work together to build more processing facilities at home and to stop waste.

The public could also help by ensuring their recycling wasn't contaminated. ""And we also need consumers to start asking for, if packaging has to be in plastic, it should be recycled PET.""

Rachel Brown, chief executive of the Sustainable Business Network, said consumer power was a powerful force, which had basically made the end single-use plastic bags inevitable.

But the business world also needed to get on board.

Plastic bags were just ""the tipping point"" of a massive surge in packaging that had run rampant, and businesses now had to be much more mindful of their impact.

""Every single business, if you're clever you'll be looking at what's coming your way.""

Brown said the Sustainable Business Network believed that 30 per cent of waste could be reduced just by design. A good example was from a Kiwi company called Ethique which had developed a soap-like shampoo which didn't require plastic containers.

""It's really rocking that whole sector.""

Meanwhile, Sage has set her sights on a carrot-and-stick solution to funding the country's much-needed new recycling facilities.

She's considering extending the waste disposal levy at landfills, which currently only applies to 10 per cent of landfills.

Sage said these landfills covered about 30 per cent of waste, largely from households.

""But most waste is created in the commercial or industrial sector so by having the levy apply to all landfills, that becomes an incentive to reduce waste going to landfill and then, how do you deal with that, you look up the supply chain as to how you reduce the production of waste in the first place.""

The levy would also provide grants to businesses interested in building new recycling facilities, she said.

""The landfill levy is a key tool because it is effectively an economic incentive to do the right thing.

""And I think businesses are recognising that there are major savings in doing things more sustainably.

""There is complexity in the sector, it won't be solved overnight but I sense a real public appetite for us to do much better.""",New Zealand,2018.11
502,Benefits of recycling batteries exciting,"What is the latest on disposing of a dead battery? For decades, we have just dumped our domestic alkaline batteries into our garbage along with all the other rubbish we produce on a daily basis. There is no legislation to prevent such dumping, but recycling, which yields useable zinc and manganese concentrate, steel, paper, plastic and brass fractions, is much more preferable as even these batteries contain harmful substances such as mercury, cadmium and lead. Community collection points are becoming more common for both rechargeable and non-rechargeable batteries. Our old lead acid car batteries of course have been collected for decades for scrap or dumped. However, newer technologies separate and reuse the plastic casings, the lead electrodes and even the sulphuric acid. Always look to put your old batteries down the recycle path into the circular economy. Battery technology is rapidly changing and rechargeable lithium ion batteries are increasingly being used in our electronic equipment, computers and vehicles. Indeed by 2028 Australia’s waste electrical and electronic equipment Li-ion batteries will have grown from 3500 tonnes per year to 25,000 tonnes a year. Rechargeable batteries in domestic appliances and the embedded batteries in our electronic equipment, computers and electric vehicles should always be returned to a recycling station. Such items contain potentially toxic heavy metals sealed up inside, and if thrown out with the regular garbage can jeopardise the environmental integrity of both landfills and incinerator emissions. In the US, the battery industry sponsors the operations of the Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation (RBRC), which facilitates the collection of used rechargeable batteries in an industry-wide “take back” program for recycling but no such legislation exists in Australia. There is an immediate need to improve processing infrastructure capacity for handheld Li-ion batteries in Australia. For the larger Electric Vehicle Li-ion batteries, some processing capacity will need to be in place in the early 2020s to manage batteries that begin to reach end of life.",Australia,2018.11
507,There’s a New Recycling System For Takeaway Coffee Cups,"An Adelaide-based packaging company has come up with an innovative solution to the great takeaway-cup dilemma by designing a recycling system that turns disposable coffee cups into paper. Detpak, a global producer of sustainable and customisable packaging, has launched the Recycle Me System. It has produced a cup with a detachable inner-plastic lining, which means the paper exterior can be recycled and reborn as paper. Contrary to what many people think, takeaway cups are generally unrecyclable because they contain a plastic waterproof lining, which can’t be recycled. The Recycle Me System deals with that problem by making it possible to remove from the cup its non-recyclable component.

It is estimated that Australians use one billion takeaway cups annually, with 90 per cent of the vessels ending up in landfill, according to the ABC. Veneziano Coffee Roasters will be one of the first cafes in Australia to use the closed-loop cup-to-paper recycling system, rolling it out at its Sydney store in Surry Hills and its Melbourne venue in Richmond. The recyclable cups will also be available at Seven Seeds in Carlton, Melbourne, at the West Terrace Toyota Showroom in Adelaide (152 West Terrace), and in select Hungry Jack’s stores in Sydney and Melbourne. In a statement, Hungry Jack’s says it estimates that the initiative should save around three trees per store per year. Detpak says there are more venues to come. Punters are key to making this plan work. After you buy your takeaway from a participating business, drain the liquid, and place the cup in the blue and black Recycle Me waste chutes at venues. Detpak has partnered with Shred-X, which will then collect, sort and recycle the cups (and remove the cups' lining in the process). You can also recycle the cups at the 50,000 Shred-X secure document-destruction service collection points around Australia (find them here).

The recyclable cups are part of a growing movement to fix the nation’s addiction to single-use coffee vessels. The NSW state government recently announced $115,000 in funding to Closed Loop Environmental Solutions to help divert 11 million disposable coffee cups from landfill each year. “We have a real opportunity to create a circular economy by reusing more of our own waste, with the added potential of job creation in a modern, smart, homegrown environmental and recycling industry,” said local government NSW president Linda Scott in a statement.",Australia,2018.11
512,What would happen if we banned landfill?,"During a study tour in Europe last year I asked an engineer working in the Swiss waste industry where their landfills were located. He replied there weren't any and that many countries in Europe had achieved similar.

I was amazed to learn this, and it has had a major impact on my thinking.

The very concept of landfills is weird when you think about it.

As a society we spend so much effort in growing and mining the food and materials that enable us to live our lives. Then when we have no further use of these we collect and send them to a big hole in the ground to be buried — out of sight and out of mind.

Landfills are uncontrolled chemistry experiments. In addition to emitting methane (a greenhouse gas 20 times more powerful than carbon dioxide) they require long-term management for many decades to ensure that they do not pollute the environment, especially our groundwater.

When Planet Ark was formed back in the early 1990s one of the reasons we focussed on promoting recycling was the belief that there was no hope of creating a sustainable society if we can't even deal with our own waste.

That's why we are wanting Australians to help create a country with no landfills.

No one wants to live near one

Increasingly we are seeing concern from communities about landfills, as no one wants to live near them or build on top of a closed one.

I often hear that is isn't problem in Australia as, unlike the Europeans, we have lots of room for landfills. What they forget is that around 7 out of 10 Australians live in our capital cities and we have one of the highest urbanised populations in the world at about 85 per cent.

This concentration of population means that our cities have very high property values and landfills are increasingly being sited hundreds of kilometres away from them.

For example, a significant portion of Sydney's waste goes to Australia's largest landfill near Goulburn, more than 200 kilometres away.

Landfills have no role in a sustainable society based on circular economy thinking.

A circular economy is one that retains the value of materials in the economy for as long as possible, therefore reducing the depletion of natural resources and impacts of material use and waste generation on our environment.

A number of countries, with a combined population of about 150 million, have virtually eliminated the need for landfills including Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Denmark and Norway.

They are all landfilling three per cent or less of their waste. Australia currently puts 40 per cent of its waste into landfill.

These countries achieved this by maximising recycling, separating and processing food and other organic wastes through technologies such as anaerobic digestion and using other energy from waste technologies for the remainder of their waste streams.

This has not happened overnight but has been part of a long-term plan including such instruments as landfill directives and levies and significant public education programs.

We have a great opportunity to achieve the end of landfills in the coming decade.

A major update to our National Waste Policy is nearing completion. This has strong targets such as a minimum of 80 per cent of all waste being recycled or recovered.

To be successfully implemented it will need strong leadership from government and business, along with substantial funding.

We will also need comprehensive national education campaigns so we can play our vital role in the recycling process.

Let's beat this target and get to 100 per cent — to think beyond landfills and create a circular economy.",Australia,2018.11
523,International Declaration on Biodiversity | Scoop News,"New Zealand is joining its voice and influence with others in the international community to better protect biodiversity by joining the Sharm El-Sheikh Declaration adopted in Egypt on 15 November.

Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage joined other political leaders at the event to discuss global biodiversity at the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) High Level Segment in Sharm El-Sheikh.

“This declaration comes at a pivotal point for nature,” Eugenie Sage said.

“Despite significant efforts, global biodiversity continues to decline. As the international community begins work to establish new biodiversity targets, we also need to increase our focus and do all we can to achieve the current “Aichi” targets. New Zealand will be doing its bit to accelerate action at home.”

New Zealand has started to develop a new national biodiversity strategy.

“With many of New Zealand’s native plants and wildlife found nowhere else in the world, we have an international responsibility to safeguard them for their own sake, and for present and future generations,” Eugenie Sage said.

The declaration focuses on the importance of mainstreaming biodiversity across relevant sectors of the economy, with a particular emphasis on energy and mining, infrastructure, and manufacturing and processing, as well as health.

“It was important to New Zealand that the Declaration acknowledge the importance of circular economy principles to ensure less waste is created and more reuse is possible,” said Eugenie Sage, “and I was pleased to see this reflected.”

The meeting of the parties to the Convention, which continues over the next two weeks, will establish a pathway towards the adoption in 2020 of a new global biodiversity plan.",New Zealand,2018.11
559,Closing the loop: linear to circular,"Since the early 20th Century, mass-produced plastics have revolutionised our lives. About 8300 million tonnes have been produced but some 80 per cent has been discarded into the environment, most into landfill. Eight million tonnes a year end up in the ocean with a half-life of at least 400 years. Our economy is unfortunately still linear; raw materials are manufactured, used and discarded. The truth of the matter is that we do recycle at home and at work in general and our LGAs recycle with the yellow, green and red bins, BUT it is what happens to the waste afterwards that is the problem. We need to foster the “circular economy” for plastics, where producers are not only incentivised to make reusable, recyclable or compostable products, but to make new products from the one-way waste stream. Cross Connections Consulting and Plastic Police are showing us the way through their efforts in developing the Circular Hub, and recently the Hunter screening of the evocative Closing the Loop film, where we saw real commercial examples of viable industries taking waste to new product. The event, which highlighted exciting circular economy initiatives happening in the Hunter and the state, was an overwhelming success attended by more than 100 guests including individuals from the community, businesses, research organisations, representatives of industry groups, government organisations and local councils. Plastic can be recycled to new uses. In October this year a global commitment to eradicate plastic waste at the source has been signed by 290+ organisations including Danone, H&M Group, L’Oreal, Mars, PepsiCo, The Coca-Cola Company, Unilever; Amcor and Veolia. Shipping pallets made from recycled plastic can replace the wooden pallets that consume 40 per cent of the world’s timber supply. Planet Ark has recycled almost 40 million cartridges into eWood a timber replacement product and TonerPave a low-carbon road surface.

620,How the Hunter’s Plastic Police are working to turn the tide,"If you can scrunch it, you can save it. That’s the ethos of Warners Bay’s Samantha Cross who is using her business know-how to challenge the idea that soft plastics, used to package everything from fruit to furniture, cannot be recycled. “At the end of the day there is more plastic than what we can produce things out of. “So we need to reduce. “But it’s knowing that if we make those changes we could stem the tide of plastics or reverse it,” she said. Plastic Police, a soft plastics recycling enterprise Ms Cross has been trialing at schools in Merewether, Warners Bay and Belair, as well as businesses Hunter Water and Quarry Mining, has been announced as the recipient of a $150,000 grant from the state government. The Waste Less Recycle More program provides funding for commercially-oriented projects that divert waste from landfill. “We need to be creating a circular economy moving away from make, take, dispose,” Ms Cross said. “Sixty per cent of soft plastics go to landfill, 30 per cent get incorrectly placed into kerbside recycling for hard plastic and only two per cent is going to bring-back schemes.” Ms Cross said trials of her business model had shown the program was reducing the amount of problematic plastics entering landfill, as well as building interest in environmental protection. “We offer a collection service to schools and businesses, and every bit of the plastic is weighed. That is so we know what percentage of what is being collected is coming back to the community as a product,” Ms Cross said. “We try to look for items that are a cost that you’re currently incurring, so that you can just substitute it.” Schools participating in the project have seen their waste come back as new benches. Belair Primary School’s collection of soft plastics was used to create 179 wheel stops for a renovated car park at Westfield Kotara. Ms Cross admitted that finding opportunities to reuse soft plastic was “difficult” but interest in growing Australia’s own market for recycling plastics, especially since China’s introduction of the National Sword policy, was promising. “I’m happy to say there's some amazing new initiatives putting soft plastic into asphalt and other products,” she said. Ms Cross has an ambition that Plastic Police, run through her Warners Bay waste management consultancy Cross Connections, could provide a regional, if not national, solution to the scourge of soft plastics. “As a region and a community we’ve got the opportunity to do something with what we collect,” she said.

759,Europa Policy Lab: The Urban Water Value Chain and Circular Economy Policies,"This Jean Monnet Europa Policy Lab is presented with the support of the Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union.

Listen to the audio recording on ANU Soundcloud

The circular economy has become a major direction in European Union policy aiming at reducing the use of resources and energy through shifting the paradigm of waste management. Instead, waste is no longer ‘waste’ but thought of as a combination of resources ready to be re-fed back into the economy. Transferring the concept of the circular economy to the urban water sector is often narrowly seen as only the opportunities presented through upgrading wastewater treatment technologies. Indeed, it is possible to apply some principles through extracting valuable resources like phosphorus, or reusing water for irrigation and sludge for agriculture or energy utilisation.

However, a circular economy should be perceived from a wider perspective looking at the entire urban water chain.

The questions that this applied policy research project will investigate are:
• How can we adapt the water balance in catchments to reduce the need for wastewater treatment and reuse?
• What is the impact of human culture and behaviour on the capacity to develop a workable circular economy (e.g. changing washing detergents or using less antibiotics and hormones to ensure reused sludge and water are safe)?
• What are the new technologies for wastewater treatment that have the greatest number of environmental co-benefits and ensure safer reuse?
• What are the risks and threats of reusing water and sludge for environmental and human health?

Professor Irina Ribarova holds a PhD from the University of Architecture, Civil Engineering and Goedesy in Sofia, Bulgaria, and has over 20 years of professional experience in university teaching, research and consultancy in the water sector. She has worked in numerous EU-funded projects as a research and project manager for removal of hazardous compounds from wastewaters and sludge; biological processes modeling (in waste water treatment plants [WWTPs] and rivers); water saving technologies (industrial and domestic); flood and drought management; nutrients (N and P) removal and recovery in WWTP; eco-efficiency of urban water systems; and the circular economy in the water sector.

760,HPE promotes 'circular economy' for end-of-use tech,"HPE is planning to show businesses worldwide that throwing old tech and assets into landfill is not the best option when it comes to end-of-use disposal.

The company has launched a first-of-its-kind Circular Economy Report. The report will help businesses track carbon, energy, and landfill waste savings for those who return end-of-use assets to HPE through the HPE Technology Renewal Centres.

A recent HPE Financial Services study found that 69% of respondent companies have an IT sustainability strategy in place, and 79% would commit to a strategy.

HPE says the report will help businesses meet sustainability goals, support reporting requirements on environmental impact, CSR updates, and tax compliance.

HPE says that organisations are constantly expanding their IT infrastructure to store and process more information, particularly to harness the value of connectivity and data to generate business value.

By using less space, materials, and energy businesses can thrive in a resource-constrained world. This is the circular economy, HPE believes.

“A circular economy reimagines a take-make-dispose system to a circular and regenerative economy. It considers the full product lifecycle: from resource extraction, to product design and use – all the way to end-of-use management to extend product and material life and lower total cost of ownership.”

“From a customer perspective, key drivers for a circular Economy approach are new sources of business value and infrastructure efficiency. From a sustainability perspective, the need to move to a circular economy is driven by a consumption rate that is beyond the earth's ability to replenish.”

The report draws on material science and product manufacturing information to show categories of products that were refurbished, remarketed, and reintroduced into the economy, and those that were recycled.

“A circular economy commitment helps IT meet business and sustainability goals, while reducing the world’s growing e-waste problem”, comments HPE Financial Services president and CEO Irv Rothman.

A circular economy that is applied to the IT industry can drive more efficient use of products and allow businesses to retire their assets in a secure, compliant, and environmentally-responsible way. HPE’s Technology Renewal Centres (TRCs) in Andover, Massachusetts and Erskine, Scotland help extend the life of technology whenever possible, and securely and responsibly recycle materials where appropriate. In 2018, HPE Technology Renewal Centres processed over 4 million units, including HPE and non-HPE equipment. Of that, 89 per cent was refurbished and resold, and the rest was recycled in a secure and environmentally responsible way.

The company has launched a first-of-its-kind Circular Economy Report. The report will help businesses track carbon, energy, and landfill waste savings for those who return end-of-use assets to HPE through the HPE Technology Renewal Centres.

A recent HPE Financial Services study found that 69% of respondent companies have an IT sustainability strategy in place, and 79% would commit to a strategy.

HPE says the report will help businesses meet sustainability goals, support reporting requirements on environmental impact, CSR updates, and tax compliance.

HPE says that organisations are constantly expanding their IT infrastructure to store and process more information, particularly to harness the value of connectivity and data to generate business value.

By using less space, materials, and energy businesses can thrive in a resource-constrained world. This is the circular economy, HPE believes.

“A circular economy reimagines a take-make-dispose system to a circular and regenerative economy. It considers the full product lifecycle: from resource extraction, to product design and use – all the way to end-of-use management to extend product and material life and lower total cost of ownership.”

“From a customer perspective, key drivers for a circular Economy approach are new sources of business value and infrastructure efficiency. From a sustainability perspective, the need to move to a circular economy is driven by a consumption rate that is beyond the earth's ability to replenish.”

The report draws on material science and product manufacturing information to show categories of products that were refurbished, remarketed, and reintroduced into the economy, and those that were recycled.

“A circular economy commitment helps IT meet business and sustainability goals, while reducing the world’s growing e-waste problem”, comments HPE Financial Services president and CEO Irv Rothman.

A circular economy that is applied to the IT industry can drive more efficient use of products and allow businesses to retire their assets in a secure, compliant, and environmentally-responsible way. HPE’s Technology Renewal Centres (TRCs) in Andover, Massachusetts and Erskine, Scotland help extend the life of technology whenever possible, and securely and responsibly recycle materials where appropriate. In 2018, HPE Technology Renewal Centres processed over 4 million units, including HPE and non-HPE equipment. Of that, 89 per cent was refurbished and resold, and the rest was recycled in a secure and environmentally responsible way.

“Our aspiration is to help customers think about their infrastructure in new ways, build strategies to extend and extract value from what they have, and use retired assets to help fund the transition to new infrastructure,” concludes Rothman.",New Zealand,2018.12
814,Textile waste: Why good intentions are not enough,"Having spent more than 30 years in executive positions in the fashion and retail sector, I was a seemingly very settled retailer, quite happy with my life until an awareness of the issue of textile waste kicked in, and then there was no going back.

Throughout my career I was lucky to have great customers, travel to exciting places and work with incredibly talented people to produce and sell thousands of units of clothing of a broad range of styles to make people look and feel wonderful about themselves.

Yet, as I got older I started to question the sustainability and logic of our industry, and there was a voice growing louder inside of me wondering if I was doing the right thing.

I was participating in a sector that promotes the designing, buying and selling of garments we know will rapidly be marked down, quickly disposed of and ultimately become landfill. Once I understood that, I knew there needed to be change and innovation.

The retail sector is now in a cycle where it is trying to compete with the growth and shift to online shopping and the growth of fast fashion players flooding the market with clothing, which is both low in quality and price.

As I worked with a number of retail charity organisations, I grew more aware of the ever-increasing levels of donations of fast fashion items, which they couldn’t sell because of the sheer volume and poorer quality.
• Australians on average buy 27kg of textiles (clothing, etc) annually.
• We waste on average 23kg of textiles per year per person, second only to the US.
• Australians wear a garment an average of six times before disposing of it – either by putting it in the rubbish or donating it to charity stores.
• Charities are generally only able to sell 15-20 per cent of donated clothing.
• Australia exported 94,000 tonnes of textile waste in 2016-17 and this is growing annually.

I became more engaged and involved in the “circular economy” debate and had the pleasure of meeting many intelligent and well-intentioned people and organisations looking to be a part of the circular economy, a movement to increase the reuse and recycling of raw materials, including textiles, rather than depositing them in landfill.

The challenge facing the retail sector is twofold. Firstly, it needs to continue to engage with a much broader audience than itself and ensure it appeals to all consumers in a practical and meaningful way. Secondly, it needs to present business models which drive real change, supporting the development of the circular economy.

Simply talking about change will not drive it, actions are needed and scale solutions are required.

The recent policy decision by China to no longer accept contaminated waste from Australia has caused an upheaval in the publicly visible areas of waste collection and management, as their traditional market is now effectively shut.

This has caused significant issues at a state level regarding the collection and storage of plastic, glass, and cardboard and significant financial subsidies to help with the recycling of this waste.

Textile waste still has not hit the radar of many governments, even the quality of data of textile waste collected or sent to landfill is not consistently measured by government bodies making policy development and implementation difficult when the scale of problem is not even visible.

The public perception of textile waste is also complicated by our relationship with our clothing. We know plastic does harm if in the ocean, so we recycle plastic bottles without thinking, but we dispose of our textile waste by donating it ‘guilt-free’ to charity stores.

Clothing, just as much as plastic bottles, needs to be reused or recycled into fibres, as charitable donations merely delay landfill, they do not stop it.

There is now technology available in Australia, allowing textiles to be recycled into fibres. For this to happen at scale, we need to see government initially support this process and there to be increased public and consumer awareness of the need to do so. Then there will be real change.

836,Google says ‘circular economy’ needed for data centres,"Speaking at last month’s TEDWomen conference, Google Sustainability Officer Kate Brandt highlighted what she called a ‘circular economy’.

Brandt is referring to how the animals, plants, and microbes of earth are effectively the consummate engineers of this planet, representing a circular system where waste doesn’t exist.

“Think of a tree that grows from the energy of the sun and the nutrients in the soil,” Brandt says.

“Eventually the tree falls and microorganisms, enzymes and bacteria begin to turn the tree back into the soil and nutrients that fuel the growth of new life in the forest. This is the genius of nature, the original circular economy.”

So in terms of what relevance this holds, Brandt believes the same principles can be applied to our modern economy.

“What if, like nature, everything was repurposed, reused and reborn for use again? What if instead of our current linear economy of take-make-waste we had a “circular economy” that mimicked this natural system? These questions aren’t just hypotheticals, they hold the key to our future,” Brandt says.

Earlier this year, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its report that revealed just how dire the environmental situation really is – we have just 12 years to make unprecedented changes to the entire global economy before the damage we have inflicted upon the planet will be irreversible.

Back to Brandt’s circular economy with a strong focus on value creation, a model she asserts could generate US$4.5 trillion of new economic output by 2030.

“We’re already putting this circular approach into practice at Google, and it’s grounded in three principles: design out waste, keep products and materials in use and transition to renewable energy,” Brandt says.

Google currently owns and operates 14 data centres across four continents, with these facilities and the employees within them effectively the ecosystems that fuel Google’s progress.

“And it’s not just Google, it’s Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Baidu and more. Cloud and IT services are not immaterial, they are a growing part of our modern world embodied in millions of data centres. Like all industrial systems, millions of data centres means a significant need for natural resources and an urgency to find a new model for addressing growing demand for energy and materials,” says Brandt.

“Stepping into a data centre feels like the polar opposite of the dirt, decay, and life of the organic world. But it’s still a system—with inputs and outputs, much like the coastal forest of my childhood.”

It’s no secret that data centres consume significant amounts of energy.

“In 2017 Google’s total energy footprint was around 8 million megawatt hours; that’s roughly equivalent to the energy used by the city of Atlanta in one year. And that’s just Google,” Brandt says.

“Data centres worldwide use an estimated 200 terawatt hours each year. That is similar to the national energy consumption of some countries like Australia and roughly one percent of global electricity demand. The other major input into the system is hardware, mostly in the form of thousands of servers ultimately made up of raw materials like tin, gold and cobalt.”

So the question is, how can the circular economy principles apply to modern data centres?

Brandt has listed a few steps Google has implemented thus far:
• Machine learning to optimise the cooling system controls, with data taken from sensors recording temperatures, power, and pump speeds to create an AI-powered efficiency recommendation system. “To date, this has produced a 30 percent reduction in energy use in the cooling system,” Brandt says.
• A transition to renewable energy, with a commitment to match 100 percent of its energy use with renewable purchases. “In 2017, we purchased power from more than three gigawatts of wind and solar projects, more than the amount of energy it takes to power the city of San Francisco for a year,” Brandt says.
• Keep products and materials in use, by designing everything for longevity, repairability, and disassembly for future use. “Today, we use components from old servers to upgrade machines and we build remanufactured machines with refurbished parts. Last year, Google sold more than 2.1 million units that we no longer had use for,” Brandt says.

Companies around the world are on their own journeys towards a circular economy, but it is certainly vital that big players like Google set a precedent.

“We believe global businesses like Google should lead the way in improving people’s lives, while reducing or even eliminating our dependence on raw materials and fossil fuels,” says Brandt.

“Together, I believe we can turn to the work of world’s most efficient engineers and reverse the global challenges created by a take-make-waste economy and create a circular world of abundance.”",New Zealand,2018.12
846,What Remains Amiss in Closing the Loop: Culture in the Circular Economy —,"As the conference room settled, Professor Ali Abbas approached the podium and looked around at the expectant audience. Nametags read universities, near and far; domestic and international research institutions, think tanks, international organizations, local and city councils to state-level authorities, start-ups, associations, consultancies and even chemical and waste management giants such as Dow, Veolia and Suez. Bright minds, officials, and suits all united for one cause: the circular economy. Professor Abbas opened the conference with a seemingly simple task. “Open the folder in front of you and find the palm card, please write down the top three words that come to mind while thinking about circular economy”. Fast forward less than one minute – pens down. The card placed on my folder ominously listed:

My selection was mainly informed by a cursory overview of the circular economy in an Industrial Ecology lecture, every word inching deeper into the fold of the esoteric. The neighbour to my left, a representative from the public sector, had ‘recycling’ at the top of her list; the neighbor to my right, an engineer and PhD candidate, jotted technology as his number one. Circular economy as a concept clearly conjured a broad range of top-of-mind ideas. So, how should one properly conceptualize and define the circular economy? More specifically, what does it mean?—Not just for you and I, but for the world and futurity.

Professor Dianne Wiley, Head of the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Sydney, followed with her opening statement, containing a candid anecdotal view on the circular economy. As circular economy enters policy agendas, as seen in the European Union, or becomes the spotlight in events such as the inaugural Australian Circular Economy Conference, it may seem like a novelty buzzword. Professor Wiley disagreed. Wiley stated that aspects of the circular economy were not new, in fact, they may have been collectively left behind. She recounted the societal modus operandi regarding material items during her childhood using her family’s dealings with clothes as an example. “Clothes were never thrown out. Articles were borrowed and shared among family, friends and the greater community. If outgrown, it was handed down; if torn, it was patched up or repurposed. If virtually unwearable, clothes entered what could be termed ‘the hierarchy of rags’. Clothes would start as cleaning rags and eventually fall to the lower rungs as grease rags. Ultimately, grease rags would be thrown into the bin or incinerated in the backyard.”

Wiley acknowledged the latter was probably not very circular economy-friendly. But what she was emphasising was not the ill-fated end-all of clothes and rags, but the sense of value vested in objects. This notion resonated among conference attendees – at dinner, table conversation was spent sharing tales of days of yore involving material thriftiness – old newspaper used for packaging over bubble-wrap, store-bought food containers reused as Tupperware ad infinitum rather than single-use food trays, the tricks to fixing a television set with a metal coat hanger instead of acquiring a full replacement. Everyone had a story to tell.

Does this mean that our past was an accurate depiction of a circular economy? Was our way of living sustainable at the time? Not exactly. Although these memories stem from more frugal times in the resource-use department, foundations were still built on the traditional ‘take, produce, consume, and throw’ linear economic model.1 Perhaps unknowingly, society practiced what is currently called ‘resource life extending strategies’.2 Resource life extension encapsulates the ‘three R’s’, commonly standing for reduce, reuse, and recycle. However, this concept has evolved to consider more ‘R’s’, including—but not limited to—the following: repurpose, refuse, recover, re-educate, remanufacture, and repair.3 This only represents a small fraction of larger concepts that make up the circular economy. Fellow University of Sydney student and conference attendee, Wynston Lee, published a succinct history and review of the term, which can be read here. Some notions pertaining to the circular economy predate official cognition of sustainable development but are increasingly framed as pieces of the sustainability puzzle.4 However, the reach of a concept implying deep systemic changes can only go as far as its identity congruence and effective implementation.5 Literature suggests that the circular economy, in theory, is still a vastly contested concept and fast approaching a junction that will determine its fate in the role it will play in our common futures.6 7 2 5 Therefore, if the circular economy embodies a crucial process in achieving sustainability, now is the time to explore and smooth out its rough edges to ensure continuity and ubiquity.

As circular economy as a concept remains plastic, multiple points of contention have arisen as opportunities for further research in determining authenticity in promoting sustainability. These potential limits have been identified in six principal areas: thermodynamics, system boundaries, physical scale of the economy, path-dependency and lock-in, governance and management, and, lastly, limits imposed by social and cultural definitions.6 Although the circular economy may face biophysical restraints through system boundaries and thermodynamics, the remaining limiting factors are essentially malleable, man-made elements. In this sense, the world is in “need [of] a broad vision that couples the economy of energetic techniques with the related socio-cultural economy that is induced by, and at the same time reciprocally influences, the mere technical transformations”.8 The previous citation was in reference to matching a clean energy transition to a green economy, but this will probably be required in the transition to a circular economy and could be extrapolated to fit the circumstance. And therein lies the issue: developing the socio-cultural fabric to weave circular economy into place. Despite its growing momentum “the concept of circular economy is still unfamiliar to most people”.9 The lion’s share of research and progress across sectors in the circular economy context has covered “concrete metrics, tools, instruments and computations”, while leaving “assumptions concerning the values, societal structures, cultures, underlying world-views” practically as uncharted territory.6 Nevertheless, studies probing the social dimension of the circular economy are appearing. Research hints at low—but increasing—public awareness, palpable divergences between private sector awareness and behaviour, while the public sector leads in awareness yet presents shortcomings in governmental and institutional synergies for successfully promoting the concept.10 11 12 13 14 Evidence-based research revealed that nuances of culture are key. Cultural barriers saddled circular economy implementation more than anything, especially due to consumer apathy and disregard for cultural sensitivities in production-consumption receptivity.9 10

Looping back to the conference, there were several instances that echoed the dearth of socio-cultural links to the circular economy. This was expressed in different forms, ranging from the excitement in an inaugural conference that opened a platform for discourse, to entrepreneurs vocalizing their concerns in awareness defining technological uptake, to coffee break chats involving several nodding heads agreeing that lack of transversal communication is an inhibiting factor to development. Yet, perhaps this attitude was nudged by Professor Wiley’s opening statements which brought a human touch to the room. It incited thoughtful reflection on attitudes and values. Within the context of complex cluster concepts, it is the density of social factors that separates from new practices to paradigm shifts.6 Perhaps the circular economy is at this crossroads, breaching the paradigm threshold.

After two days of conferencing, just as before, Professor Abbas took the stage, this time with closing remarks and a final request, “Take your palm card, flip to the second side and please write the top three words that come to mind while thinking circular economy, I promise they will be different”. My left and right-side neighbors’ top words—education and cooperation—respectively. My takeaways? Three words starting with the letter c:

And so it seems that without these elements the circular economy may just come full circle rather than materialize a sustainable future.

A petition organised by the campaigners has received more than 15,000 signatures on website Action Station and will be presented to Parliament on Tuesday.

Campaigner Holly Dove said the scheme not only has proven sustainability results, but could benefit the wider community as well.

""It's getting really amazing recycling results overseas as well as really great litter reduction rates. It also has heaps of cool benefits for the wider community, things like fundraising,"" she said.

""Some people might want to donate their bottles to the local school or the local scouts groups and they can do big fundraisers with them.""

According to the petition, proposed bottle deposits would give people a refund of greater than 10 cents when they recycle a bottle.

Ms Dove said it would easy for the public to get involved.

""How it would work is that you would have places where people can return their beverage containers. So that could be really easy to find spots like at the supermarket,"" she said.

It also sets consumption targets and recommends sustainable activities for guests.

There were two winners of the medium-sized business award: Biopak and GlamCorner. BioPak, a provider of single-use takeaway packaging, won the award for its commitment to the circular economy.

GlamCorner allows people to rent designer dresses to help curb fast fashion culture.

Both Officeworks (in partnership with Greening Australia) and Bank Australia (in partnership with Greening Australia and Trust for Nature) won Banksia awards for large businesses.

Officeworks has been applauded for its Restoring Australia initiative, where two trees are planted for each one used based on the weight of paper-based products purchased at in the stationery stores.

Bank Australia has received recognition for its 10-year strategy for its Bank Australia Conservation Reserve, which seeks to protect and support the reserve’s ecosystem, embed Indigenous land management, revegetate the reserve and deliver value to staff and customers.

28,Plastics industry calls for time to restructure itself,"Returnable or compostable coffee cups were just the start of a backlash against non-sustainable plastics.

Faced with a backlash against plastic packaging, the industry that makes it is in a race against time.

Plastics NZ and Packaging NZ have responded to a report by Sustainable Business Network on how the business sector, manufacturers and the Government should approach the country's rising levels of plastic waste.

Its recommendations were for brands and retailers to ""design out"" problematic or unnecessary plastics, increase the amount of recycled content and start innovating packaging that could be re-used.

In a joint statement, Packaging NZ's executive director Sharon Humphreys and Plastics NZ's chief executive Ken Sowman said the industry certainly supported all that.

 * What you need to know about the circular economy

 * Why the Government is planning to ban plastic bags

But the industry was complex. ""The biggest challenge for our industries … is to design systems which meet expectations but still prevent product waste, don't compromise health and hygiene, and that don't put cost pressures on the most vulnerable in our society.

""We must avoid changes which push manufacturing off-shore, putting New Zealand businesses and jobs at risk, especially where it is clear there will be no net benefit socially, environmentally or economically.""

Humphries said the circular plastics economy, where all plastics packaging is collected, reused or recycled, was the ideal.

But the journey to achieve this would require government leadership, both central and local, sector collaboration, new infrastructure and considerable technical innovation.

Society at large would also need to be willing to change. ""We also need to engage society to address consumption and tackle the scourge of litter and illegal dumping which is wreaking havoc on our pristine environment.""

Infometrics economist Brad Olsen said that the plastic packaging industry in New Zealand had about 1,700 workers and 70 businesses that could be affected by the Government's decision to phase out single-use plastic bags.

That was ""a sizable number of workers and businesses who may not able to continue operating"". The six-month lead-in time would be vital for these workers to retool and retrain.

""Plastic bag manufacturing is relatively specialised, meaning workers are unlikely to have highly-transferable skills that they can use to get another job straight away.""

But the ban had would increase demand for non-plastic packaging, and the industry was expecting to need additional workers.

​Infometrics estimates that the wider packaging sector will need almost 12,000 additional workers between now and 2022.

For some manufacturers the shift away from plastics would open doors to produce more sustainable packaging, in materials like cardboard, paper, or even beeswax.

For others, their best option might be something else entirely.

China's decision to ban most imported recycling had meant the price of plastic to recyclers had dropped, and more and more recyclable plastics were headed straight to the landfill.

And consumer attitudes had shifted, so even if a manufacturer's product was recyclable, ""change is upon us one way or another.""

 * Recycling is not enough to get rid of plastic waste: report

 * The other plastics: Retailers and manufacturers pick up the plastic bag baton

How much are we recycling?

First the bad news: according to a 2016 report, only 14 per cent of the world's plastic packaging is collected for recycling.

That's billions of wasted materials: the study also suggests that 95 per cent of plastic packaging material value is lost to the economy. Our lack of recycling facilities means most of our plastic recycling is shipped overseas.

The buzz phrase in environmental circles these days is the ""circular economy"". This is where materials are used to the max, and at the end of their life, all the components that make them up are reused. It's the opposite to the ""'take, make, waste"" approach which has led to our current problem.

New Zealand has signed up to an international declaration for dealing with plastic packaging by 2025.

It includes getting rid of unnecessary packaging, moving to 100 per cent reusable, recyclable or compostable packaging, and using recycled content by 2025 or earlier.

How do we achieve it?

It won't be easy, but the report outlines three broad plans of attack:

* Simplifying the types and complex formats of plastic packaging

 * More processing facilities in New Zealand

 * Better labelling and consistent collections around the country

Recycling alone won't resolve the situation. The report says businesses using plastic packaging should:

* do an audit to replace problematic single-use packaging or figure out whether it can be reused.

 * redesign their packaging to make recycling easier 

 * support suppliers that do provide packaging with recycled content

Meanwhile, the report says the packaging sector should:

* bring in a national labelling system for recycling, compostable and recycled content

 * expand markets for recycled material

 * expand product stewardship schemes into rigid plastics

Innovation is definitely coming to the fore, with businesses starting offer everything from recycling toothbrushes to re-usable sanitary products.

How about the Government?

Its role is multi-pronged, according to the report. It could:
• start collecting accurate data on plastic packaging

 * urgently develop a strategy to deliver its promises
• increase the landfill waste levy to incentivise change
• invest in onshore recycling facilities
• facilitate common collection and recycling processing nationwide

• provide R&D funding to establish alternatives to single use plastics

And what can I do about it?

Two things. You can sort the recycling that is taken to ensure that there's nothing contaminating it. Buyers of recycling are much fussier these days.

The other thing you can do is as flex your power as a shopper. Look for products which use less or recycled packaging. Ultimately, the consumer's voice will shout loudest.",New Zealand,2018.12
38,Recycling is not enough to get rid of plastic waste: report,"BYO containers at supermarkets and refillable products like Soda Stream help reduce or remove plastics in the environment.

Recycling alone won't be enough to solve the issues associated with plastic packaging, a new report claims.

The Sustainable Business Network says massive collaboration between businesses and industries is needed if New Zealand is to meet the tight seven-year target it has signed up to in a global plastics packaging agreement.

""There needs to be a wider approach, for example, problematic and unnecessary plastic packaging needs to be identified and eliminated from our supply chains,"" the report's author, James Griffin, says.

Griffin, who is in charge of the network's ""circular economy accelerator"" programme, said plastic packaging had developed deeply entrenched processes over the last 60 years. ""No one entity will be able to transform it on its own""..

According to the report, 40 per cent of oil-based plastic goes into packaging, most of it single-use.

Lightweight and cheap, oil-based plastic has played a fundamental role in protecting food and other goods across long and complex supply chains.

But if trends continue, plastic will account for 20 per cent of the world's oil consumption by 2050.

New Zealand's plastic waste problem had come sharply into focus after China's decision last year to ""effectively close its doors"" to imported recycling, forcing countries to address their rapidly growing mounds of waste.

The report traced the lifespan of packaging at 10 major New Zealand companies including Bluebird Foods, Coca Cola, Countdown, Lewis Road Creamery and New Zealand Post

It makes 47 recommendations including a call for individual businesses to audit the types and amounts of plastic packaging they use.

Ecostore was one of the companies involved, and its managing director Pablo Kraus says it has tried to minimise its footprint by rolling out refill stations so consumers can reuse their containers.

""We're supplying over 60 locations now and hoping to grow that to well over 100 in the next couple of years,"" he said.

""I think one of the biggest challenges we face is changing consumer behaviour.""

The company had also switched to sugar cane-based recyclable containers. The change had cost Ecostore about $1.8 million over four years but the payback would come in reducing its plastics spend over time.

""We see it as doing what's right and on the other side of it we've managed to capture over 5,500 tonnes of carbon from being released into the atmosphere.""

One of the key problems was a lack of information on plastic packaging lifespans, the report said.

""Up -to-date information on the import, production, use, disposal and export of plastic packaging in New Zealand is woefully inadequate.""

Information was important for determining what should happen to different types of packaging.

About 50 per cent of packaging could be recycled, and about a fifth could be reused. But according to some estimates, about 30 per cent of packaging could never be reused or recycled and it would have to be ""designed out"".

Griffin said the global 2025 target was ""an ambitious target, and we need that to arrest the problem that we have"".

""It is feasible to meet, but it needs to be a very significant and sustained amount of innovation and focus and investment.""

The effort required would be almost unprecedented, he said, and it needed the Government, which had been influential in phasing out plastics bags, to provide a holistic plan.

""Companies, for example, have been looking doing it with their suppliers and they've realised they're hitting up against some system issues, so there is this realisation that collaboration is going to be needed to solve this"".

The report also noted that labelling plastics as recyclable was important, but the presence of the code did not mean the item was going to be recycled. That was a matter of location.

And there were other obstacles. Sometimes the price of recycled plastic flakes were higher than virgin resin.

Consumers were also confused about plastic recycling marks meant, and there was no consensus on what deserved to be labelled ""recycled content,"" which risked ""greenwashing"".

And finally, there was the fact that recycled materials couldn't be used forever.

""In reality there are technical limits on the number of times plastic can be mechanically recycled before its functional performance is affected. Further work is required in this area. Chemical recycling may provide the answer.""",New Zealand,2018.12

41,SBN report: Plastic packaging re-think needed | Scoop News,"The first-ever study on NZ’s entire plastic packaging system highlights how even radically improved recycling will not solve all its problems. New Zealanders need to rethink the way we make, use and dispose of plastic packaging.

New Zealand’s Plastic Packaging System – An Initial Circular Economy Diagnosis was prepared by the Sustainable Business Network’s (SBN) Circular Economy Accelerator.

It highlights how everyone has a role to play and no one entity can solve the issues associated with plastic packaging. A co-ordinated circular economy approach is required, which tackles the root causes of the problem not just individual symptoms.

In a circular economy the life cycles of materials are maximised, usage optimised and at the end of life, all materials are reutilised so that nothing is wasted. This presents a viable and prosperous alternative to the dominant linear, ‘take, make, waste’ system.

The study was led by James Griffin of SBN's Circular Economy Accelerator.

“There has been an explosion in the use of plastic packaging in the last 60 years because it is relatively cheap, lightweight and durable. Unfortunately, systems to properly manage it have not kept pace. This has led to a global waste and pollution crisis, including here in New Zealand. More recently, the stresses in our system were highlighted when China effectively closed its doors to the world’s waste.”

The study identifies measures to significantly increase recycling rates such as reduction in the types and formats of plastics used, more on-shore processing facilities, consistent collections around the country, increasing demand for recycled materials and a container deposit scheme.

James cautions that, although such measures offer opportunities to improve the situation, recycling alone cannot solve the issues associated with plastic packaging.

“There needs to be a wider approach, for example, problematic and unnecessary plastic packaging needs to be identified and eliminated from our supply chains. Reuse models need to be adopted and scaled as an alternative to single-use plastics.”

The SBN study drew on global research by the UK's Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF), as well as more than 40 interviews with key stakeholders across NZ’s plastic packaging system. The work was supported by 10 major New Zealand businesses. Many of them have signed up to The New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, developed by EMF and UN Environment. This has 290+ signatories, representing 20% of the world’s plastic packaging production.

The Commitment includes targets for eliminating problematic or unnecessary plastic packaging. It involves moving from single-use to reusable packaging. It aims to stimulate new ways to ensure all packaging can be easily and safely reused, recycled, or composted by 2025. Another goal is to significantly increase the amounts of plastics reused or recycled and made into new packaging. The targets are set to be tightened over time. Participants are required to publish annual progress reports.

The SBN study was partly designed as a foundation piece to help enable participating business to meet these commitments and go beyond them. The report provides 47 recommendations to achieve a new comprehensive nationwide plastic packaging system that works. The top recommendations are as follows:

Individual businesses need to:
• audit the types and amounts of plastic packaging they use. This should find out the types of plastics being used and identify problematic single use plastics
• set bold targets to design out problematic packaging and enable dramatically improved recycling
• support suppliers providing packaging formats with high levels of recycled content

The business sector also needs to work together to:
• expand the market for recycled materials
• develop product stewardship schemes for rigid plastics

And the government needs to:
• develop and implement a comprehensive plastic packaging strategy with bold and ambitious targets

Plastic packaging features significantly in many New Zealand businesses. Adopting a circular economy approach will enable them to address the very real concerns of their customers. It will help them see beyond recycling so they can help prevent unnecessary resource usage, minimise waste and prevent pollution.

42,Work on waste underway | Scoop News,"A new report out today shows that the Government is on the right track to tackle our waste problem, Associate Environment Minister Eugenie Sage says.

The Sustainable Business Network today released its report - New Zealand’s Plastic Packaging System 2018 An Initial Circular Economy Diagnosis.

“SBN’s report is an excellent addition to the public discussion and growing awareness of New Zealand’s waste challenges,” Eugenie Sage said.

“Work is already underway on a number of the recommendations the report identifies for the Government to lead on. This includes work we are doing to collect accurate data, expand the waste levy, and invest in on-shore recycling facilities. The Waste Minimisation Fund is available to support projects to deal with plastic waste including creating packaging alternatives.

“The SBN report highlights the gains from a circular economy approach. I look forward to Government and businesses working together and further constructive initiatives like the report.

“Manufacturers, retailers, the resource recovery sector, councils and consumers all have key roles to play and Government leadership is required. We need a fundamentally different approach where we design waste out of our economic system by adopting a circular economy approach.

“This includes designing products for a long life and which are also easily able to be repaired and renewed, or designing them to be easily ‘unmade’ at the end of their life and their materials recovered and either made into something new, or returned to nature.

“We need manufacturers to be doing much more, faster and manufacturers, retailers and consumers to drive change up the supply chain.

“Earlier this year I announced a work programme to tackle our wider waste issues, which includes expanding the waste disposal levy to all landfills, improving our national data on waste and resource recovery, investing more strategically in infrastructure and innovation to support resource recovery and onshore processing of recovered materials. The Ministry for the Environment is developing a circular economy strategy identifying sectors to target investment.”",New Zealand,2018.12
94,Unhealthy food production is killing us,"Forget obesity, malnutrition or car accidents — industrial food production could be our leading cause of preventable deaths.

Hidden killers, including air pollution, water contamination, pesticide exposure and excessive use of antibiotics and fertilisers are making healthy eating impossible and the problem is escalating, according to a recently released report.

The Ellen MacArthur Foundation report — Cities and Circular Economy for Food — claims industrial food production factors could be implicated in 5 million deaths/year within 30 years. This death statistic is twice the current number of people killed by obesity and four times the number of people killed in road traffic crashes globally. The report, produced with analytical support from SYSTEMIQ, was launched at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Switzerland.

Even when trying to make healthy food choices, consumers are at risk because of the way food has been produced. Synthetic fertilisers, pesticides and mismanaged manure exacerbate air pollution and contaminate soils and water.

The report highlights the enormous environmental damage caused by food production which is currently responsible for almost a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions.

The Foundation sets out a vision for a new system based on circular economy principles, where food is grown locally and in a way that regenerates natural resources, waste is eliminated through better redistribution and by-product use, and healthy food is produced without the need for harmful practices.

The report finds that eliminating waste and improving health through the circular economy could be worth US$2.7 trillion a year to the global economy. Health costs caused by pesticide use would decrease by US$550 billion a year and antimicrobial resistance, air pollution, water contamination and foodborne diseases would reduce significantly.

Greenhouse gas emissions would be expected to decrease by 4.3 Gt CO e, the equivalent of taking one billion cars off the road permanently. The degradation of 15 million hectares of arable land would be prevented and 450 trillion litres of fresh water saved annually.

The way we produce food today is not only extremely wasteful and damaging to the environment, it is causing serious health problems. It cannot continue in the long term. We urgently need to redesign the system. People around the world need food that is nutritious, and that is grown, produced and delivered in a way that benefits their health, the environment and the economy.

Cities are key to alleviating this crisis. By 2050 they will consume 80% of food, giving them the power to drive the shift to a healthier system. Cities themselves can unlock US$700 billion a year by using organic materials to help produce new food and products and by reducing edible food waste.

443,"Restoring the Hauraki Gulf, a process of reconnection","The saying ‘Ko au te wai, ko te wai ko au/I am the water and the water is me’, is, thankfully, now familiar to many New Zealanders. When the water is healthy, we are healthy. But, equally, when the water is unhealthy, it is because we are unhealthy. When the water’s mauri, or life giving essence, is degraded, it is a reflection of a deficit in us.

What then, does the current state of the Hauraki Gulf tell us about ourselves? If the Gulf is us, then while things might look good on the surface our well-being is not adequately protected by law. The many organisms that make us up are badly depleted. Our life supporting channels are clogged with waste and contamination. If we pause for a moment, we can feel it.

We could continue to try to ‘symptom swat’, like we sometimes do with other aspects of our health. Instead of painkillers and plasters, we can look to the first aid of beach clean-ups and protection for some areas or some species. That helps tackle the emergency. In our GulfX programme, SBN is looking to add to those tools.

But on their own these things won’t resolve the underlying disease. Until that is done more and more symptoms will appear. Currently we have systems that remove the life from the water and pump pollution in, season after season. We need to permanently change them.

That’s why we have brought together major areas of our nationwide work, and applied them to GulfX. The GulfX project has received funding from Gulf Innovation Fund Together (G.I.F.T) – a Foundation North initiative.

Through GulfX, our promotion of litter traps will help reduce plastic flows to the sea. That’s important as a band aid solution. But reducing and redesigning problematic plastic packaging through our circular economy work will begin to tackle the problem at source. Assisting commercial fleet managers to specify copper free brake pads for their vehicles will help stem the tide of heavy metals disrupting the web of life below the waves. But accelerating the transition to an efficient and zero carbon transport system will reduce pollution of all kinds from fossil fuelled vehicles.

At the same time we are accelerating our established and successful Million Metres Streams project. This will plant more of the waterways in the Hauraki catchment with native plants and trees.

All these measures also help tackle climate change, which is radically altering and disrupting the marine environment.

GulfX will be launched at a special event at SEALIFE Kelly Tarlton’s THIS THURSDAY February 28. It’s only $20 for members and $40 for non-members. The evening includes time to experience exclusive access to the aquariums, drinks and nibbles. You can find out more about the programme and meet with some of the innovative people we are working with.

460,Sustainability in sight as Ikea plans to rent out furniture,"Need a new kitchen but can’t afford one? In the future, you may be able to rent one from Ikea.

The global furniture manufacturer says it plans to offer a leasing alternative for commercial customers in Switzerland, starting with desks and chairs.

Ikea says the move is a test that could see the company renting out more furniture in the future, including kitchens.

And it’s all part of Ikea’s move towards a circular economy, where sustainability is key. Furniture that can be refurbished, recycled or resold contributes towards a desired “longer life” for Ikea products.

In an interview with the Financial Times, Inter Ikea chief executive Torbjorn said that while the commercial furniture leasing is a trial, the company hasn’t ruled out leasing, rather than selling kitchens as well.

“You could say leasing is another way of financing a kitchen.”

“When this circular model is up and running, we have a much bigger interest in not just selling a product but seeing what happens with it and that the consumer takes care of it.”

The company will also establish a spare parts division, so components, such as hinges and screws can be bought to repair furniture no longer in stock.

Ikea currently owns 250,000 acres (101,171ha) of forests in European countries, including Romania and the Baltic States, and last year purchased a 25,000 (10,117ha) forest in Alabama, US.

461,Preventing a global recycling Armageddon | Food & Beverage,"Barry Cosier, director of sustainability for the Australian Food and Grocery Council (AFGC) tells Food & Beverage Industry News why there needs to be a rethink on how Australia recycles.

It would be fair to say that most Australians could not imagine life without household recycling. Kerbside newspaper collections commenced across the country in the 1970s and 1980s, followed shortly by the yellow-lidded bin collection of fully commingled materials.

Recycling has become as entrenched in the household routine as emptying the mailbox or locking the front door. Until now, perhaps.

Thanks to the introduction of the China Sword policy in 2017, the resource recovery and recycling sector is under immense pressure to sustain recovery rates; households are becoming reticent and unsure about the efficacy of their recycling efforts; and many are looking squarely at government and industry for a new solution. So, what does this mean for food and grocery manufacturers?

The good old days

 Some people are old enough to remember when glass bottles were returned to the corner store for recycling and used milk bottles were collected by a pre-dawn milkman. While the recovery rates for these items were high, all other packaging material ended up in landfill. The introduction of commingled collection and recycling dramatically increased the recovery rates for paper, cardboard, plastic, aluminium, glass and steel, while concurrently reducing needless waste.

Over time, advancements in packaging technology also reduced food waste that was previously disposed of in landfill. Barrier protection materials increased the shelf life of products in store and the home, providing almost year-round availability of seasonal produce for consumers.

We now take for granted the many benefits that packaging affords: food safety, food freshness, tamper-evident packaging for medicines, hygiene barriers for personal products, portion control to reduce waste and obesity, and limited breakages in manufacturing, transport, retail and the home. The list goes on.

Like many industries over the last 30 years, China’s appetite for raw materials gave us a ready-made destination for discarded packaging. After sorting materials locally, Chinese recyclers would reprocess packaging into new products and new packaging materials, which were then marketed world-wide. Demand (and therefore prices paid for packaging materials) peaked to a point that some Australian recyclers could afford to sort recycled materials free of charge and pay local councils for the material collected at the kerbside.

It was almost too good to be true. And it was good until China implemented the China Sword Policy, effectively banning the receipt of mixed paper and plastics through setting very low acceptable contamination levels.

Recycling Armageddon

 The introduction of the China Sword policy has left local kerbside recyclers with recycled materials that no longer meet the quality specifications required by global processors. The heydays of exporting to China have ended – with no plan B. Simply put, Australia does not have sufficient recycling processing infrastructure in place to recycle packaging collected at the kerbside.

This complex global problem cannot be solved by simple solutions that some may suggest.

 All stakeholders along the supply chain – from packaging manufacturers, product manufacturers and retailers to the consumer, local councils, collectors, and recycling processors – have a role to play in finding environmentally and economically sustainable solutions.

Certainly, leadership and support from local, state and federal governments is essential. However, more importantly, industry must collaborate with all stakeholders and provide government with industry-led solutions if we are to gain their confidence and support in developing new local infrastructure that will meet the needs of both manufacturers and material processors. Put simply, all stakeholders must work together to safeguard the general public’s confidence in recycling.

Next steps: What can manufacturers do?

 In the coming years, a circular economy must be developed. What is a circular economy? Simply put, it’s when waste materials, such as packaging avoids being landfilled and is repurposed or recycled to reduce the use of virgin materials. Examples include, converting plastic milk bottles into new milk bottles or into park benches, or using glass to make new bottles or low-grade glass in civil construction. With the federal government endorsing national recycling and recyclability targets for packaging, what can manufacturers do?

Increase recycled content

 As manufacturers of grocery products, the first key step is to increase the amount of recycled material contained in product packaging. To drive this, the federal government has endorsed the packaging targets proposed by the Australian packaging Covenant Organisation (APCO) to increase the recycled content of packaging to 30 per cent by 2025. Many manufacturing companies have already committed to this goal.

Design for re-use, recycling or composting

 The second step is to increase the use of recyclable or compostable packaging where product freshness, safety, quality and food waste is not compromised.

Design for source separation

 Use the Australia Recycling Label (ARL), which provides consumers with simple instructions on how to dispose of each packaging material type. The addition of tear tabs on multi-material packaging such as plastic blister on a cardboard backing, will encourage consumers to separate materials prior to placing it in the recycling bin.

An industry-wide approach

 There are many food and grocery manufacturers that have already made commitments in the above areas. However, while implementation may appear simple on the surface, there are some real barriers that need to be addressed in order for product manufacturers to make progress. The Australian Food and Grocery Council (AFGC) has collaborated with APCO, government, the packaging industry and the resource recovery and recycling sector to overcome the following barriers:
• Availability of recycled packaging materials

 Retailers and manufacturers have broadcast their intent to purchase greater volumes of recycled plastics such as recycled PET (rPET), which is currently in short supply, particularly given the high standards for food grade materials. The AFGC is working with APCO and the packaging industry to increase availability of these materials.
• Research and development

 The AFGC is working with APCO and the packaging and recycling industries to develop new compostable plastic substitutes that are fit-for-purpose and meet food grade and medicinal product packaging specifications. Additionally, research and development of new processing technologies that have the potential to recover materials currently landfilled are also required. For example, chemically processing end of life plastics (Numbers 4-7) into oil-based products such as bio diesel.
• Practical infrastructure planning

 We will continue to collaborate with all stakeholders to identify the recycling infrastructure needs of a circular economy. This will be aligned with the changing mix of packaging materials as the availability of recycled packaging material increases and as new processing technologies are developed over the next five to ten years. This whole-of-supply-chain approach is critical to provide industry and government with confidence to invest in the plant and equipment that is necessary to achieve the national packaging targets.

The good news is that environmentally and economically-sustainable solutions are possible for all stakeholders along the packaging supply chain without compromising product freshness, safety, quality, or increasing food waste. But this will only occur with collaboration, with decisions based on facts, and undertaking research and development to provide new technological solutions for today’s issues.",Australia,2019.02
467,"Despite the crisis, don't lose faith in recycling","China’s ""National Sword"" policy, last February, to restrict imports of some recyclables set off a chain reaction that exposed how vulnerable our system is, and should have delivered an important wake-up call to governments. Unfortunately, 12 months on, we are in the midst of another recycling crisis.

Victoria’s largest recycler SKM, which receives more than half of the state’s kerbside recycling, has temporarily shut its three materials recovery facilities for safety reasons.

In the immediate short term, a number of councils have been able to divert their recycling to other processing facilities. However, with limited reserve processing capacity at other facilities, land-filling is sadly the only option for many councils. Unsustainable levels of waste generation and market failure are the primary causes.

This crisis runs much deeper than councils’ contractual arrangements. About one third of the councils affected are already party to collaboratively procured contracts developed in partnership with Victorian government agencies.",Australia,2019.02
474,Greens start war on waste in Nelson with beach clean-up,"Green Party co-leader James Shaw gets stuck into the beach clean up at the Waimea Inlet in Nelson.

The Green Party's war on waste started up in Nelson on Saturday, with a group of locals getting together to help clean up the Waimea Inlet.

About 100 people were on hand for the job, including Green Party co-leader James Shaw.

The clean-up drive was one of about a dozen the Green Party had organised around the country, but forecasted rain had cancelled them everywhere else but Nelson.

Teams worked throughout the morning to clear areas around the shoreline of Waimea Inlet, and also areas near State Highway 6 where rubbish was often discarded by motorists.

 * China has stopped taking our recycling and waste. Here's where it's ending up

Nelson Green Party spokesman Nelson Matt Lawrey said about 316kg of rubbish was collected during the day, much of it plastic and polystyrene.

Lawrey said there had also been a lot of cigarette butts picked up near Whakatu Drive, close to patches of bush.

""It appears that, despite the extreme fire hazard, people are still chucking butts out the car window which is pretty horrifying.""

Shaw said as well as cleaning up New Zealand beaches, the initiative was aimed at bringing attention to the amount of waste being produced and discarded throughout the country.

Tagged as ""the war on waste"", Shaw said Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage had been working with the Ministry for the Environment to find ways of reducing and reusing waste, particularly from packaging.

Shaw said the phasing out of single-use plastic bags in 2018 was a ""symbolic first step"", as they accounted for roughly one per cent of New Zealand's waste problem.

""It's a massive issue, quite frankly we have colossal amounts of waste even relative to other OECD countries.

""We've never dealt with it, we've relied on the fact we're a low-population, low-density country and could export our waste out into the environment.""

He said the need to act was becoming more pressing, particularly with China restricting imports of waste products in 2018.

Packaging was one of the major sources of waste produced, with products either over-packaged or unnecessarily packaged.

In 2018, Sage announced the New Zealand Plastic Packaging Declaration, which included 12 local and international companies committing to eliminate non-recyclable or non-compostable packaging by 2025.

""There is a component of it that is upstream, working with companies to minimise what they're doing with design and packaging of products, so less waste is produced downstream.""

Shaw said the aim was to create a circular economy, where products and packaging were not immediately discarded.

""We still need some level of packaging, but can we create products and packaging we can reuse rather than dispose of, and how do you dispose of it in way that isn't just chucking it in a landfill.""

According to a recent Colmar Brunton poll from December 2019 – the Better Futures Report – the issue most New Zealanders were concerned about was the build-up of plastic in the environment (72 per cent).

513,MARKET PULSE: The circular economy brimming with job opportunities,"A special MARKET PULSE report on waste: There’s a world of job opportunities from waste now that China’s (justifiably) refused to take our refuse. For every 10,000 tonnes of material recycled in Australia, 9.2 jobs are created. That’s a big jump on the 2.8 jobs if the material was exported. Here’s the case for approaching waste as a fabulous opportunity for growth.

In February last year China stopped importing many recyclables from overseas. It left Australia without an export market for its waste – as much as 1.25 million tonnes of material.

The ban was as an opportunity to rethink Australia’s approach to waste management, with many in the industry advocating for the transition to a more circular system where waste is collected, processed and then reused to make new products here in Australia.

But Waste Management and Resource Recovery Association chief executive officer Gayle Sloan told The Fifth Estate that a year on, there’s not enough happening to transition Australia away from a linear waste management approach.

She says there’s been “no paradigm shift” and that action is needed urgently from state and federal governments to reinvigorate the Australian resource recovery industry and create a local market for recyclables.

And although the urgency stems from the growing piles of recyclables that are creating fire hazards, Sloan says Australians are also missing out on jobs, innovation and economic opportunities by failing to instrument changes.

For every 10,000 tonnes of material recycled in Australia, 9.2 jobs are created. This is compared to 2.8 jobs if the material was exported, she told the ABC recently.

Although there’s been much interest in the recycling industry, Sloan says the benefits will be far more wide-reaching.

“There’s a complete shift around what happens – we are transitioning from a recycling economy to a circular economy,” she says.

“You start to create new jobs and industries.

“You think about industries like Airbnb and Uber, that’s part of the circular economy, that’s reducing waste, increasing efficiency. All this disruptive stuff comes out of circular thinking.”

What we need is more sharing and leasing, not owning

She expects to see more sharing and leasing in the future, especially items that are used infrequently. One example is the Brisbane Tool Library, a social enterprise that allows people to borrow hand and power tools, as well as camping gear and other items (sport equipment, kitchen/party appliances and Christmas decorations).

“Who uses their hammer 100 per cent of the time? And in this way we’re not drawing down on the environment.”

As well as the “blue collar” jobs created by the circular economy in remanufacturing and other administrative processes, there’s also “white collar” roles to be filled in design and principles.

“It’s also the redesign – how do we build a building so we can refurbish and reuse it? There are so many jobs in the supply chain if you think about the design and waste processing.

“Nothing should come to market without a clear end of life home.”

The circular economy will result in a variety of jobs, she says, including part time jobs for people who don’t want to work full time.

It will also unlock “handy skills that people have forgotten”, such as mending clothing.

The South Australian government has emerged as a leader in this space, releasing a report in 2017 that made it the first jurisdiction to try and quantify the benefits a circular economy would have on the state. The report found that by 2030, compared to a business as usual scenario, a more circular economy could result in an additional 25,700 full time jobs for the state.

The report also found that a transition could reduce SA’s greenhouse gas emissions by 27 per cent or 7.7 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2030.

Plastic Forests managing director David Hodge is in the business of upcycling contaminated plastic films – a material he describes as the “basket case” of the plastic waste system.

He says different parts of the market have been affected in different ways by the tightening up of Chinese imports of recyclables.

The market for rigid plastic, such as PET, has fallen dramatically but there is “still enough of a market that it’s being pulled through” in places such as Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam.

But the market for soft plastic, according to Hodge, has “completely collapsed.”

“People were paying for it and now they are not.”

Hodge says there’s a sense that this could be a low cost “gold rush” product ripe for upcycling but unfortunately the “ugly duckling” of the waste world poses major problems for prospective up cyclers.

This is chiefly because unlike rigid plastics, multilayered films can’t go back into the system at food grade at this stage.

“We’re ages away from that because we still rely on mechanical recycling. Maybe in 10 years there will be chemical recycling… that’s beginning to happen now in a couple of pilot projects.”

Undeterred by these challenges, Hodge’s company has developed a dry-cleaning method for recycling contaminated food and agricultural plastic films, which it then remanufactures into a number of product lines.

Products include the Green Mongrel range of sheet products, garden edging and underground cable cover used for essential services such as underground electricity and gas lines.

Hodge believes more of this “outside the box thinking” is necessary to solve the challenges facing the waste industry.

“Manufacturing in Australia creates jobs, supports economic development and promotes prosperity in our communities, all of which have a positive flow-on effect for all Australians,” chief executive officer of frank green Benjamin Young says.

Young says that there’s been minimal action from government action to grow the local manufacturing industry.

“I can invest in bringing innovative technology to Australia but manufacturing isn’t my game and it’s really the job of our government to create incentive for local manufacturers to adopt new manufacturing technologies.

“It’s ridiculous and prehistoric that we can’t manufacture stainless steel in Australia.”

Young is sceptical of the economics of recycling because the commodity price for many recyclable products doesn’t justify the sorting process.

“Reusing is really the only option”.

Government action needed urgently to turn the situation around

Gayle Sloan says the industry is not satisfied by the response to the waste crisis so far from state and federal governments, and is calling for funding injections to deal with the crisis, as a start.

Councils also say that a lack of funding combined with low recycling prices is stopping the construction of better infrastructure and the reinvigoration of the beleaguered recycling market.

“New South Wales urgently needs a big investment of funding from the waste levy to begin the process of growing a domestic recycling industry,” local government NSW president, Linda Scott, told The Guardian.

There has been some funding allocated by state governments. The NSW state government diverted $47 million to help industry respond to China’s new policy in March last year, and the Victorian government announced a $37 million package that includes using its own purchasing power to drive demand for recycled products.

State, territory and federal environment ministers in 2018 have agreed to develop an action plan to implement the 2018 National Waste Policy at their next meeting on Thursday.

Attitude is also part of the problem

Part of the problem, according to Sloan, is that some governments “don’t quite get us” (the waste management industry).

“They see us as an industry that needs to be regulated. But the more forward-thinking states see it as a market and an area for growth.”

“And you can’t regulate your way to success.”",Australia,2019.02

That is the question prompted by a new analysis that reveals the relatively small cost of compulsory recycling schemes that would help solve Australia's waste crisis.

The figures come ahead of a meeting of Commonwealth, state and local officials this week to break a stalemate over the Morrison government's National Waste Policy – one of the last remaining opportunities before the May election to find political momentum on the pressing issue.

732,Product longevity keeps facilities sustainable,"The circular economy encompasses many aspects of a businesses that can be changed to improve environmental impacts and create a more profitable business. While creating and highlighting change by promoting that a company uses renewable energy and environmentally friendly materials is one way to show a company cares about sustainability, ensuring the longevity of equipment used in a manufacturing facility can be just as important.

Companies, such as Atlas Copco Compressors, are helping businesses’ equipment last longer, thus saving them money and minimising waste. A McKinsey and Company report, Mapping the Benefits of a Circular Economy, highlighted that the circular economy is a reliable way for industries to increase their profitability while reducing their dependence on natural resources.

McKinsey recognised several potential circular economy activities that could improve performance and reduce costs. These are shifting to renewable energy and materials (regenerate), promoting the sharing of products or otherwise prolonging product life spans through maintenance and design (share), improving product efficiency and removing waste from supply chains (optimise), keeping components and materials in closed loops through remanufacturing and recycling (loop), delivering goods and services virtually (virtualise), and replacing old materials with advanced renewable ones or applying new technologies such as 3-D printing (exchange).

Atlas Copco Australia Compressor Technique business line manager, Jeff Treble, said small changes and replacements can have a positive effect on companies wanting longevity from their products.

“We are maximising the uptime of the compressors for customers by replacing parts under a structured preventative maintenance program. This ensures they have a long life cycle.

“There are components that have a short life time and need to be replaced. A minor component that can be replaced is an easy fix, but if it’s a major component it can cause a major catastrophe,” said Treble.

“Everything can be repaired, but the cost to repair a major component could be more than buying a new machine.” By offering ongoing service and using genuine parts, Atlas Copco helps ensure that products last as long as possible.

Atlas Copco has featured in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index several times – recognising its commitment to being one of the top sustainable companies.

“Environmental aspects are extremely important for Atlas Copco. Sustainable productivity is one of our core values,” said Treble.

He suggested that companies use genuine parts and implement a thorough preventative maintenance plan to help machinery last longer – boosting their circular economy activities.

“There are plenty of pirate manufacturers in the market. The difference is we know those components have been tested with our compressors. The reliability of those components can be affected by quality and design of those materials.

“Using a non-genuine filter can cause disruption to your air flow. There are current components that fail if they are not genuine. They can increase the chance of a pressure drop. For every one bar of pressure drop, you lose seven per cent of energy savings,” said Treble. “That is significant.”

He said working with customers to ensure they have the right equipment and know how to work with that equipment is important. Through research and development (R&D), Atlas Copco Compressors is able to ensure it provides the most efficient products to the market.

“R&D is so important to our customers. We know the life expectancy of the components through all the testing we do.”

The company also implements preventative maintenance plans, which Treble said was a top pritority for Atlas Copco Compressors and it should be at the top of the list for other companies.

“Preventative maintenance servicing is 100 per cent the way that you should ensure longevity. It comes down to making sure the compressor is in the right environment.

“For example, a hot, dusty environment would require more servicing than a cool, clear environment. The better quality the air is, the better quality we can filter the air.”

But, Treble said that even if a compressor is in a dusty environment, such as a mine, there are ways to minimise damage, for instance housing the compressor in a sheltered location.

Smart factories for sustainable future

 Implementing smart solutions for a manufacturing facility also fits within circular economy activities.

Realise Potential founder and industry expert John Broadbent said with smart factories, manufacturers can see what’s going on in their production process, anywhere, anytime. “This helps with recall prevention and eliminates incorrect product being distributed. It means you can notify your customers about any breakdowns that are going to affect production. It improves the efficiency of production so you save money and you can get more capacity out of your existing equipment. The big one I’m seeing at the moment is reduced waste to landfill.”

Broadbent, who is a speaker at the AUSPACK Business and Industry Conference, has more than 40 years’ experience in manufacturing. The last 20 of these have been dedicated to helping businesses of all sizes, use smart factory concepts. He’s seen first-hand the positive change these investments have made, both on profitability, longevity and culture.

By not implementing smart and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, companies can unknowingly be creating a loss and waste in their facilities as their machinery can become outdated.

“I see organisations struggling with equipment they bought overseas that’s not ‘open architecture’, so when they want to become a smart factory they can’t connect to that piece of equipment. They must buy equipment where they can access the source code, because if they can’t extract the information they need, they’re unable to then feed into machine learning or any artificial intelligence platforms,” said Broadbent.

Switching to sustainable materials

 While smart factories and preventive maintenance solutions that help machines last longer are creating more sustainable facilities, companies can implement change by using sustainable materials with a new twist. One academic, who specialises in using biosolids to replace more labour-intensive and unsustainable products in bricks, said companies often steer clear of alternative solutions when they could be seeking help to implement new environmentally friendly materials to their facilities.

RMIT University school of engineering associate professor, Abbas Mohajerani, said companies should think of research collaborations with universities as a chance to improve sustainability processes in their facilities. “I think the manufacturing industry should really continue to make steps to find a solution to environmental issues. They have a big role to play. They have to start seriously contributing to those sustainability goals,” said Mohajerani.

“They should really start to think about values of some of the waste materials.” Mohajerani and his team researched how biosolids can be used to create sustainable products that can be used in factories, for example. The research sought to tackle two environmental issues – the stockpiles of biosolids and the excavation of soil required for brick production.

“More than 3 billion cubic metres of clay soil is dug up each year for the global brickmaking industry, to produce about 1.5 trillion bricks. Using biosolids in bricks could be the solution to these big environmental challenges.

“It’s a practical and sustainable proposal for recycling the biosolids currently stockpiled or going to landfill around the globe,” he said. The research examined the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of fired-clay bricks incorporating different proportions of biosolids, from 10-25 per cent.

The biosolid-enhanced bricks passed compressive strength tests and analysis demonstrated heavy metals are largely trapped within the brick. The research showed brick firing energy demand was cut by up to 48.6 per cent for bricks incorporating 25 per cent biosolids. This is due to the organic content of the biosolids and could considerably reduce the carbon footprint of brick manufacturing companies.

“Most environmental issues are out of sight, out of mind. We are all responsible to think about and meaningfully do whatever we can for restoring natural sustainability to the environment, otherwise we will all be guilty of ignoring the deep, and potentially irreversible, environmental damage we have caused.”

Mohajerani said using biosolids is just one simple solution that manufacturers can consider. “They are much lighter and more porous. They have low thermal connectivity that means less heat transfer.” He said by considering alternative materials when manufacturing products, businesses can save on energy and daily running costs, while reducing their carbon footprint.",Australia,2019.03
733,Multidisciplinary Sydney experts support landmark UN report,"Professor Elaine Baker, a marine scientist from the School of Geosciences and UN Environment collaborating centre GRID-Arendal, and Professor Tim Stephens, an expert in international environmental law from the University of Sydney Law School, were among 250 world-leading scientists and experts who contributed to the sixth Global Environmental Outlook (GEO-6) report.

The report warns that damage to the planet is so dire that people’s health will be increasingly threatened unless urgent action is taken.

It also highlights the fact that the world has the science, technology and finance it needs to scale up environmental protections and move towards a more sustainable development pathway. However, it reports there is still insufficient support from the public, business and political leaders to take appropriate action.

""The results of GEO-6 are generally pretty depressing, with many ecosystems showing continuing decline since the last global assessment in 2012,"" Professor Baker said.

""GEO-6 makes it very clear that the many stressors we have placed on our environment will impact the livelihoods, health and food security of many of the most vulnerable on this planet, our only home. We can only hope that the science of the GEO will drive future policy decisions.""

Professor Stephens said: ""GEO-6 makes a clarion call for governments to embrace truly transformative policy change if we are to have a chance at meeting the challenges of sustainable development, including maintaining a safe climate.""

Both academics said they were pleased to contribute to this vital work of the United Nation’s environment agency.

Professor Baker, a world-renowned expert in marine science and ocean governance, was the lead author of a chapter in the report – Oceans and Coasts – which examined the human pressures on the health of oceans over the last decade. Commentary on this chapter was also published in The Lancet. She also contributed to a chapter on Oceans and Coastal Policy and a section on circular economy.

As one of the contributing authors to a chapter on Systemic Policy Approaches for Cross-cutting Issues, Professor Stephens was able to draw from his ongoing research on how international environmental law can be made more effective in the Anthropocene – the period during which human activity has been the dominant influence on climate and the environment.",Australia,2019.03
735,"Labor to ban plastic bags, microbeads from 2021","Single-use plastic bags and microbeads will be banned across Australia from 2021 if Labor wins the upcoming federal election.

The $290 million plan is designed to protect vulnerable wildlife and reduce the amount of waste dumped into the environment.

""Something like 90 per cent of all sea birds have plastic in them. A third of all the sea turtles around the world are dying from plastic poisoning and consumption,"" Labor leader Bill Shorten told reporters in Melbourne this morning.

If Labor wins government the party will consult with states, territories and industry on how best to introduce the ban.

The European Union has already voted to ban all single-use plastic by 2021.

""If you buy a television set (in Australia), it will be packed with styrofoam,"" Labor's environment spokesman Tony Burke said.

""You buy an almost identical television set in Europe, it will be packed just as safely, but with recyclable material, probably coming from the same factory.""

South Australia, New South Wales, Queensland, the Northern Territory and the ACT have container recycling schemes, but they are not nationally consistent.

Labor will not force other states to set them up.

""We're working on the basis that it's opt-in,"" Mr Burke said.

Instead, the plan will focus on setting up a nationally consistent scheme to separate recycled materials, making it far cheaper to recycle in Australia.

Other planned initiatives include a $60 million national recycling fund, the appointment of a national waste commissioner, and $15 million to help neighbouring countries clean up the Pacific Ocean.

Labor also wants to see 70 per cent of Australia's plastic packages recycled or composted by 2025, but said there had been no pathway to make that happen until now.

Single-use plastic bags and microbeads will be banned across Australia from 2021 under a Labor plan to cut waste.

The move, designed to protect vulnerable wildlife and reduce the amount of waste generated, is part of a planned $290 million spend by Labor aimed at making Australia cleaner for future generations.

“Plastic has a devastating impact on our natural environment — more than a third of the world’s sea turtles were found to have plastic waste in their stomachs, and it is estimated around 90 per cent of seabirds eat plastic waste,” a joint statement from Opposition Leader Bill Shorten, Labor senators Penny Wong and Kim Carr and environment spokesman Tony Burke said today.

If Labor wins government they will consult with states, territories and industry on how best to introduce the ban, which the party said would create consistency after many jurisdictions moved to phase out plastic bags.

Other planned initiatives include a national container deposit scheme, a $60 million national recycling fund, the appointment of a national waste commissioner, and $15 million to help neighbouring countries clean up the Pacific Ocean.

“Australians want action from government to help reduce waste and build a circular economy,” the Opposition’s statement said.

“So while many Australians do their duty — they recycle, compost, use keep cups for their morning coffee — we need the government to take a leading role to tackle some of the big, structural problems.

“For too long the federal government has left issues of recycling, plastics and waste to state governments and local governments.

“Plastics and waste are now becoming both a national and international problem.”

Social media has been set ablaze by the proposed policy, with many supporting the idea of a nationwide ban.

Not everyone thought it was a good idea though, declaring it “not a smart move”.

Some major Australian retailers banned plastic bags last year, initially causing an uproar with shoppers.

But within three months, the country’s two leading supermarkets Coles and Woolworths, saw an 80 per cent drop in the consumption of plastic bags nationwide, according to the National Retail Association.

Plastic microbeads have already seen a drop in use as part of a voluntary move by companies to eliminate them.

894,Food scrap power and plastic roads: is this the solution to our waste crisis?,"Food scraps sent to the waste-to-energy plant at Wollert, in Melbourne's north, feed a hungry beast.

The plant owned and run by Yarra Valley Water can process up to 33,000 tonnes of food waste every year, enough to power about 2,000 homes.

The process begins when food waste is delivered from airlines, commercial suppliers and the nearby Melbourne Wholesale Fruit and Vegetable Market.

The waste is scooped up and fed into the mouth of the machinery, where it's chewed into smaller pieces and piped into giant tanks.

""What we're basically doing here is converting food waste to renewable energy using the gas that's produced when you starve the waste of oxygen.""

The gas is burned off to power two turbines, generating enough electricity to power the neighbouring water treatment plant.

About 70 per cent of the power generated is fed back into the grid, and Mr McCafferty says the process creates about a twentieth of the amount of methane that it would in landfill.

""We're planning a second plant ourselves and there's definitely a lot more scope.""

Waste-to-energy is in its infancy in Victoria relative to the rest of the world, but there are about 20 small-scale plants in operation and proposals to build more.

The Yarra Valley Water plant uses an anaerobic digestive model, but others would incinerate or create gas from household rubbish.

China's ban on low-grade recyclables has sent governments and industry scrambling for solutions, and then-environment minister Josh Frydenberg championed waste-to-energy as one option.

But apart from taking several years to build, environment groups are concerned building large-scale waste-to-energy plants would embed a reliance on generating waste as fuel.

Nick Aberle from Environment Victoria said waste-to-energy was a complicated question.

Even a plant relying on food waste has its issues, he says.

""One of the questions that we would have is [is] this actually the best use for our food scraps? We know that organics can be converted into compost which acts as a fertiliser so that is potentially a better option.""

But when it comes to burning household rubbish, Dr Aberle has concerns it would undermine recycling while damaging the environment.

""The more plastic you're burning you're basically running a fossil-fuelled power station which is what we're trying to get away from.""

Waste-to-energy the only operation at scale

The Wyndham City Council, in Melbourne's west, recently agreed on planning permissions for a new waste-to-energy plant at Laverton North that would process 600 tonnes of residual household waste.

The council's director of city operations Stephen Thorpe says it is one of the few that still operates its own waste services and is looking to move away from reliance on landfill.

He recently took part in a tour of waste facilities in Europe, where he saw waste-to-energy in action.

The Victorian Government was developing a policy on waste-to-energy, releasing a discussion paper canvassing the issues.

However it has now been shelved while it develops a broader strategy for reducing waste.

Energy and Environment Minister Lily D'Ambrosio is firm on the issue.

""It cannot undermine a focus on developing up a very strong recycling sector.

""The actual production of energy shouldn't be the goal of a waste-to-energy project, it's an important by-product, absolutely… but the first principle of the waste hierarchy is you encourage people to create less waste.""

""At the end of the day the amount of material going into landfill or waste-to-energy is materials lost, so the more people can do to minimise the amount the better,"" he says.

However he says Victoria should adopt similar policy positions to those in Europe, diverting waste from landfill and taxing what does end up at the tip.

""Because every option that's available as an alternative to landfill [in Australia] is more expensive.""

The Victorian Government is due to finalise a circular economy policy by 2020 — a series of actions to reduce how much waste goes into landfill, encourage recycling and recycling-based manufacturing.

But businesses like Close the Loop in Melbourne's north are already in action.

Close the Loop collects printer toner cartridges and soft plastics, working with construction company Downer to create a road surface built from recyclables.

Close the Loop's Peter Tamblyn says for the circular economy to work, customers need to purchase recycled products.

""We're facing a waste crisis, we've got a solution that is part of the answer to that waste crisis, particularly around soft plastics.

""The challenges are shifting the thinking to innovation, shifting the thinking from just purchasing a road to purchasing a road but also solving a waste crisis… we're not the answer but we're part of the answer.""

Rethinking the use of ""stuff""

According to Jenni Downes from the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology Sydney, the circular economy is about more than recycling.

She points to car share schemes as an example of the principles in action.

She says despite kerbside recycling collections across the country, Australia has not been a big recycler.

""What we think of recycling here in Australia is actually sorting, so we collect material and sort it into different streams and then we look for other people to recycle it and send it off overseas,"" Ms Downes said.

""And that's something that the China ban has really highlighted and made it clear that that's one of the things to progress towards a circular economy that we need to be doing here in Australia is actually using that material in our own products.""

Environment Minister Lily D'Ambrosio says the Government has changed its procurement policies to encourage consumption of recycled products.

She says they have also injected more funds into the recycling sector to help them adjust to China's policy.

""And that is why a circular economy policy will be an all-encompassing set of policies, objectives and actions.""

While the recycling crisis means governments are struggling to cope with plastics in the short term, Ms D'Ambrosio insists it should not undermine confidence in the system.

""Victorians have always wanted to do the right thing by our environment and they are always looking for opportunities to do more. And we encourage Victorians to keep recycling, keep separating out your household rubbish.""

924,CIRCULAR ECONOMY HELD BACK BY HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS,"A circular economy represents a golden opportunity to combine corporate sustainability with profits, but is obstructed by weak chemicals legislations in every part of the world. In many cases, the corporate world is ahead of legislation, and the notion that there is a contradiction between corporate profits and sustainability is becoming increasingly outdated.

This is the key message in a new publication, The Missing Piece – Chemicals in Circular Economy, from ChemSec – the International Chemical Secretariat, an independent non-profit organisation that advocates for substitution of toxic chemicals by safer alternatives.

“Toxic chemicals are very much overlooked in circular economy discussions, but they need to be addressed to make it truly sustainable,” says ChemSec Executive Director Anne-Sofie Bäckar. “Sadly, a large majority of policy makers either do not understand this, or simply don’t care.”

ChemSec’s publication discusses business opportunities in a circular economy, product planning and design, supply chain management, legal compliance, and reuse and recycling. It features five progressive companies – Apple (technology), H&M (fast-fashion clothing), Ikea (furniture and appliances), Coop Denmark (consumer goods) and recycling specialist Sarp Industries – and how they work with chemicals within their business models.

Apple recently announced its goal to one day make its products using only recycled or renewable resources, and has developed disassembly robots that can remove and sort components from up to 200 iPhones per hour, recovering materials that existing techniques such as shredding can’t, at a higher quality.

H&M is developing and implementing a positive list of chemicals to be considered right from the design phase, with the aim of designing garments using only those. Instead of focusing on what not to use, it now focuses on what it should use. The list is publicly available.

Ikea now has 64 per cent renewable and 8 per cent recycled materials in its entire product range, and its aim is to use only renewable or recycled materials by 2030. Its challenge is to find recycled materials from other sources of the right quality and not containing harmful chemicals.

Coop, a member-owned cooperative, applies a stricter approach to chemicals than Danish legislation calls for, and recently ran a petition campaign calling for stricter legislation. Its media activity, campaigning and presence in the public debate actually resemble that of an NGO at times.

On the other hand, Sarp is concerned about politically ambitious recycling goals being set with no concern for what is technically and economically feasible. Focusing on the quantity of materials being recycled and how to increase this, without looking quality of recycled products, just leads to bad practices and cutt¬ing corners.

These case studies illustrate how a growing number of manufacturers and retailers compensate for weak legislation by setting much higher standards of their own. Recently, this positive corporate movement has been on a collision course with legislation that allows for recycled materials with toxic contents.

“More and more companies are interested in recycled materials, but only if they are free from toxic chemicals,” says Bäckar. “Chemicals legislation therefore needs to be set up in a way that actually supports a toxic-free circular economy. That means picking up the pace, banning the use of obviously problematic substances and raising the requirements for chemical transparency in materials.”",Australia,2019.03
101,Kerbside collection reviewed,"The end of plastic rubbish bags and the introduction of a new organic waste collection service in Dunedin might have to wait until at least 2022, the Dunedin City Council says.

The council has, since last year, been reviewing its kerbside collection services as part of its Waste Futures Project.

Options ranged from continuing with the status quo to a host of potential changes, including alternatives to user-pays black rubbish bags and the introduction of a green waste collection service.

Council waste and environmental solutions group manager Chris Henderson said work on a detailed business case should be complete by the middle of the year.

The best options, together with estimated costs, would then be released for public consultation, before the council settled on changes.

However, the size of the possible change meant it would be years before any new service was introduced, he said.

Public consultation was due later this year, but funding then needed to be allocated at next year's long-term plan hearing, he said.

A contractor would also have to be confirmed and time allowed for them to prepare to provide any new services.

Also, depending on the options selected, new facilities might have to be built, he said.

""The earliest we could look to have a new service on the ground would be 2022.

""I would love to get something done sooner; I just don't think it would actually be physically possible.""

Mr Henderson said ""pretty much everything"" remained on the table as options for now, but complaints about black plastic rubbish bags, and calls for a new organics service, were creating ""public pressure"" for change.

Both options were being considered, but questions still to be answered included what exactly a new service would be like, he said.

A new organics service could involve kerbside collection for every home in the city, or drop-off points for people to take their garden waste, he said.

Rubbish bags could be replaced by a bin system, but alternatives would be needed in the central city to avoid clutter, and in some steep hill suburbs, he said.

""That's all the stuff that's going into a detailed business case analysis to try and come up with some good answers to put out for consultation.""

His comments came after reports to councillors last year noted an audit of the Green Island landfill in 2012 had found 26% of all waste was organic.

A subsequent audit of 100 council rubbish bags last year found organic waste comprised 43% of the contents.

The council last year had resolved to explore ways of increasing resource recovery and waste minimisation.

A subsequent Tonkin and Taylor report recommended options to explore in more detail, ranging from promoting greater composting at home, or drop-off points for organic waste, garden waste or both, to a full city-wide kerbside collection service.

The cost of any new service could range from just $10,000 a year to more than $9 million a year, although the ""highly indicative"" figures contained a margin of error of +/- 50%, council staff said.

Work on the Waste Futures Project since then had settled on a move towards a ""circular economy"" as the optimal approach to waste management.

161,Oram: The sixth wave is coming,"Other than the fact they are our two biggest producers of greenhouse gases, it seems cars and cows have little in common. However, both will benefit from the next wave of the industrial revolution, writes Rod Oram.

The creativity, enterprise and well-being of a society is far greater than the sum of its parts. That’s true in all we do; and even more so in our response to the climate crisis. Our transformation to a low emissions nation will make us more sustainable and wealthier environmentally, socially, culturally and economically.

While we have abundant climate opportunities, the synergies between them are far more important. Progress in one sector builds confidence and change in others. It’s a virtuous circle, as learning and ambition flow back and forth between sectors, triggering further rounds of initiatives.

For us the synergies are particularly powerful because our emissions are split 50/50 between urban and rural sources. There seems little in common between cars and cows beyond being our two largest generators of greenhouse gases. However, both will benefit from the latest wave of industrialisation. They can become ultra-low emitters in the way the products are made and used.

This sixth wave of the industrial revolution features the likes of: radical resource productivity; whole systems design; biomimicry (the borrowing of technologies from nature); industrial ecology; green chemistry; renewable energy; and green nanotechnology.

This revolution is just what humans and the planet need for survival. After our five waves of extractive industrialisation, during which we did massive damage to ecosystems and climate over the past 250 years, this is the start of our first restorative wave.

This is also the first wave that plays to our strengths in New Zealand. We have the greatest wealth of natural resources per capita, bar fossil fuel producers; we are more dependent on those resources for earning our living than any other developed country; and biology, the science at the heart of this revolution, is the one we develop and commercialise best.

Our rural sectors are taking their first tentative steps in this revolution, as I described in this recent column; and likewise are our urban sectors, as this column reported.

This column describes some of the synergies between the two. Among the most important are the new business disciplines driving the transformation to a clean economy. These include measuring and minimising natural resources consumed and pollution generated, particularly greenhouse gases; developing circular economy systems to ensure natural resources and human-made materials are completely recycled and reused; and using financial disciplines such as green finance and responsible investment to incentivise progress.

The Natural Capital Coalition, with more than 300 members, is one example of this work internationally. Here in New Zealand, some leading businesses and government agencies have established The Aotearoa Circle to do likewise. Notably, they are a far richer, deeper mix of urban and rural organisations than in similar bodies overseas. However, they are still beginners with a very long journey ahead.

“The shift from the old economy to a new, low-emissions economy will be profound and widespread, transforming land use, the energy system, production methods and technology, regulatory frameworks and institutions, and business and political culture,” our Productivity Commission said two years ago in its issues paper on our transformation to a low emissions economy.

Its final report last year included valuable insights and recommendations on all sectors of the economy. It made the case that the transformation to low emissions would make the economy more sophisticated, valuable and sustainable. But to achieve that, it added, we need to massively reorient our science, research and development, and innovation systems to those opportunities. Moreover, companies have to become more agile and responsive.

Overcoming vested interests is another considerable challenge. Businesses dominant in their sectors prosper from their established practices, technologies and market power. Only a few enlightened ones pioneer changes that might cost them in the short term but benefit them and society longer term.

To get the laggards going on the transformation to a low emissions economy, the Government will have to deploy a powerful range of incentives, penalties and mandates. The most important is a true and effective price on carbon through the Emissions Trading Scheme. While it’s invested heavily in ETS improvements to come, its work elsewhere is still rudimentary.

One of the most effective ways to fast-forward this progress is to emphasise the synergies between sectors. For example:

- precision environmental monitoring on farms will help develop the science, technology and systems for more effective urban environmental management, particularly of water, land and predators;

- developing renewable electricity as an economic source of energy for urban industry will also quicken its adoption in rural sectors, particularly dairy processing, and displace fossil fuels in urban and rural sectors, while contributing to the growth of the electricity sector;

- estimates of the growth in electricity use by 2050 vary from the Productivity Commission’s 45-65 percent to Transpower’s 100 percent (with unknowns including the rate of take up of electric vehicles and of electric heat in industry) but across that range there will be plenty of investment in a 21st century electricity system featuring entirely renewable energy, much more small-scale and local generation and electricity storage, and an intelligent, two-way grid and local lines networks to integrate the new technologies;

- we can improve the environmental quality and attractiveness of our homes and low-rise buildings by using more engineered timber in them, creating new business for forest owners and timber processors, while ensuring that some of the carbon sequestered in plantation trees remains locked up post-harvest in the buildings; and

- many of our best climate opportunities offer co-benefits across many sectors - in rural areas, for example, planting trees on erosion-prone land improves land management, soil conservation and water quality, while in urban areas, better diets, energy efficient homes, more “active transport” such as walking and cycling, and cleaner air and water all make people healthier.

To realise these and myriad other climate opportunities, however, we need significant improvements in the way we tackle these enormous, multi-faceted and inter-dependent issues.

We need, for example, to care far more for our biosphere – the air, land, water and species that are our life-support system; to understand “change is not an event but a complex learning and unlearning process for all concerned,” as Geoff Scott, an Australian sustainability scientist wrote in his submission to the Productivity Commission; and to greatly improve our political culture, systems, policy making and governance so we can work together on complex issues that far transcend election cycles and selfish interests.

Every nation in the world has these towering challenges in responding to the global climate catastrophe. But we have some advantages many don’t, such as the natural abundance of our land and seas, our location in the South Pacific, the character and diversity of our people, and our close connections as a small country with a highly rated, functioning democracy.

Best of all, we can lean over the fence and ask our neighbour: “Do you need a hand?”",New Zealand,2019.04
192,Circular Economy Innovation Network holds first stakeholder meeting,"The new Circular Economy Innovation Network has held its first stakeholder meeting, with the NSW government initiative in its startup phase and aiming to identify opportunities to reduce and reuse waste.

The first meeting, according to a statement, was dominated by the scale and complexity of the challenge. The initiative is seeking to identify and map the opportunities for stakeholders – from across governments, industry, universities and not for profit groups – to link and create a circular economy “in which waste is valued as a resource”.

CEIN is headed by Professor Veena Sahajwalla, a materials engineer and inventor and Founding Director of the University of NSW’s Centre for Sustainable Materials Research and Technology (SMaRT).

“We can actually change the way things are done now in design, production and manufacturing to reduce waste, and we know we can use waste as a resource rather than for most of it to end up in tips,” said Sahajwalla in a statement

“By making the right connections between researchers, businesses and governments, we can play a significant role in developing a true circular economy in Australia.

“What is clear is that we need much greater coordination and connectivity across stakeholders to identify the opportunities and problems in getting a circular economy really going.

The first stakeholder meeting at UNSW was attended by 150, and emceed by Michael Sharpe, NSW and ACT Director of the Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre.

CEIN was announced in February, and is supported by $1.5 million in state government funding.

239,Australia’s recycling nightmare,"Now that China has refused our recyclables, what technology is Australia investigating to help deal with our waste crisis?

Sustainable waste: What can Australia do to re-use our waste?

Australia has catapulted headfirst into a crisis that’s been building for a long time.

The nation is trapped under a mountain of its own waste, lacking the resources to even begin to deal with it — and plastic is our biggest demon.

While Aussie households have gradually become accustomed to sorting rubbish for recycling, the illusion of success was shattered when China abruptly stopped accepting our refuse in 2017.

The country had been processing 60-70 per cent of the world’s recycling, but when it realised the negative impact on its environment, it suddenly shut the door. India has cut us off, too.

Australia has only a few dozen processing plants compared with China’s thousands. So our plastic bottles, containers and coffee cups have been piling up at overstretched facilities, or shipped off to be illegally burned or buried in Southeast Asia.

“We don’t have enough built infrastructure to process our generated volumes of plastic,” Plastic Forests founder and owner David Hodge told news.com.au. “The Federal Government is a basket case. It needs to coordinate with all the states to action a national plan.

“Just imagine there’s no garbage trucks coming down the street any more to pick up rubbish. That’s the situation we’re in.

After 20 years of relying on China, Australia is suddenly facing a visceral nightmare, as we start to drown in our own materialism.

While we have made some steps towards reducing single-use plastic, we still use around 3.3 billion plastic bags, 2.6 billion coffee cups, 2.4 billion plastic straws and 1.3 billion plastic bottles each year.

Soft plastics cannot be recycled, and when households dump plastic bags in the recycling bin, it acts “like chewing gum going through the machine”, which may have to be stopped and decontaminated.

Soft plastics cannot be recycled in the kerbside collections, and when households dump plastic bags in the recycling bin, it acts “like chewing gum going through the machines” at the Municipal Recycling Facilities, which may have to be stopped and decontaminated.

“When we put it in our recycling bin, where does it go?” asks Mr Hodge. “It’s taken almost a generation to train Australians to recycle.

“It needs this — almost emergency powers to step in and address it.”

NSW is the only state or territory without at least a commitment to ban single-use bags. Major retailers have already cut them out, with Coles and Woolworths driving an 80 per cent drop in the consumption of plastic bags nationwide by December last year.

Many want to see federal action, with Labor promising to ban single-use bags and microbeads by 2021 if it wins the election as part of a $290 million plan to cut waste and clean up the oceans. But the solution to our self-made hell will not be easy.

Australians are becoming aware of their impact, with the ABC’s War on Waste having a huge impact in 2017 after it exposed that we were ranked fifth in the world for generating the most municipal waste. A video of supermarkets dumping edible bananas helped it become the broadcaster’s most successful social media campaign.

Nine’s 60 Minutes this week tackled how recyclable rubbish is being dumped in Indonesia, Vietnam and, in particular, Malaysia, which received more than 71,000 tonnes of our plastic in the last year alone.

But the wake-up call has come late in the day, and answers are desperately needed.

Suggested solutions include replacing our plastics with biodegradable versions, taxing non-recyclable or “virgin” plastics, stockpiling the rubbish while we improve our recycling capabilities or burning plastic to create energy.

All of these ideas come with their own costs and challenges. Mr Hodge says he’s concerned the Government will rush headlong into burning plastic for electricity — a hugely expensive energy source — when it could focus on investing in the “circular economy” and creating jobs in the process.

We are living in what he calls a “DUD economy” — Dig it up, Use it, Dispose of it. Most things don’t work like that: more often, water, food and materials are part of a cycle.

“Everybody’s trying to do everything as cheaply as possible, it’s not long-term sustainability,” warns Mr Hodge. “It’s just an enormously expensive fuel.

“We want to keep plastic as plastic.”

Companies are now manufacturing garden furniture, bollards, park benches and cable insulation from recycled plastic. Plastic Forests has found a way to create a mini wheel stop from plastic film using a grant from NSW Environmental Protection Agency’s “Waste Less Recycle More” $802 million initiative.

Australia needs smart investment, clear thinking and innovative ideas to deal with the monumental challenge. This catastrophe may be the wake-up call we need.

A spokesperson for the Department of the Environment and Energy told news.com.au that in 2016-17, Australia generated 67 million tonnes of waste, with 55 per cent recycled, and around 2.5 million tonnes of plastics waste, with 12 per cent recycled.

“Australia’s generation of waste per person has been trending downwards, reducing by 10 per

cent since 2006-07,” said the spokesperson. “Australia’s recycling rate has been trending upwards, increasing by 26 per cent since 2006-07.

“In 2017-18 Australia exported 4.3 million tonnes of waste, or six per cent of national waste

“Over $1 billion has been spent on waste management activities since 2014, including actions, research and programs to support the delivery of the 2009 National Waste Policy. This does not include funding provided by state, territory and local governments.”

In December 2018, 80 per cent of exports went to Vietnam, Indonesia, China (including Hong Kong and Macau), India, Malaysia and Japan.

The 2018 National Waste Policy sets out 14 “circular economy” strategies to improve waste management outcomes in Australia, including avoiding waste, increasing industry capacity, and reducing the impacts of plastics and packaging. Environment Ministers have requested an action plan to implement it.

The policy states that for every 10,000 tonnes of waste that is recycled, 9.2 jobs are created, compared with 2.8 jobs if the same amount of waste was sent to landfill.",Australia,2019.04
294,The shocking truth about recycling,"Plastic Forests founder and owner David Hodge said Australian’s are being lied to. Picture: 60 Minutes

Plastic Forests founder and owner David Hodge said Australian’s are being lied to. Picture: 60 Minutes

WE all think we're doing something decent for the environment when we recycle - but the truth about where it ends up might shock you.

Most of Australia's plastic rubbish ends up being stockpiled in warehouses or shipped to South-East Asia to be illegally burned.

This means that, instead of being recycled, mountains of it is being dumped, buried or burned in illegal processing facilities and junkyards in Southeast Asia.

Sunday's night's episode of 60 Minutes explores the contentious practice and it argues it began when China closed its doors to Australia's plastic waste just over a year ago.

It argues that, for more than two decades, our plastic recycling industry was reliant on China - who we sold our mixed and often contaminated plastic waste, and they melted it down into new plastic goods to sell back to us and the rest of the world.

However, much of it is now just stacking up in the yards and warehouses of Australian recycling companies - as we don't have the facilities to reprocess it ourselves.

""I think most people in Australia feel lied to, I think they feel disappointed,"" Plastic Forests founder and owner David Hodge told 60 Minutes.

""Ninety per cent of people do want to recycle, and they need to be enabled to be able to do that.""

Since China stopped buying our rubbish, India - which was the fourth biggest import for Australia's waste - followed suit last December.

As a result, Australia's recyclable rubbish is now being dumped in Indonesia, Vietnam and, in particular, Malaysia, which received more than 71,000 tonnes of our plastic in the last year alone.

Mr Hodge told the program the worrying trend has come about as a result of a lack of planning in Australia.

""We haven't built the infrastructure. We haven't thought ahead,"" he tells Bartlett.

""Now we're here and we're drowning in plastic.""

Analysis of our waste exports commissioned by the Department of the Environment and Energy stated that several Asian countries, including Malaysia have proposed crackdowns on waste imports.

""If Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand enacted waste import bans similar to China's, Australia would need to find substitute domestic or export markets for approximately 1.29 million tonnes (or $530 million) of waste a year, based on 2017-18 export amounts,"" the analysis warned.

The Waste Management and Resource Recovery Association of Australia (WMRR) chief executive officer, Gayle Sloan, has taken aim at the Federal Government - saying it has done ""done nothing"" since China shut us off.

She told ABC, the 1.2 million tonnes of recyclable materials households are producing could be turned into jobs and investment if the circular economy can only take off.

""We've had meetings, we had more meetings, and then we've had more talk, and we had no action,"" she said.

Now, Mr Hodge's company is hoping the exposure of mainstream media coverage will make the government and the public take notice.

""Recycling only works when people, corporates and government buy products made with recycled content,"" the company wrote on its Facebook page this week.

298,CIRCULAR ECONOMY THRIVES ON NETWORKING,"Most of the solutions required to implement a circular economy within NSW and across Australia already exist… they’re just locked up in research institutions. This was one of the encouraging messages from a NSW Government funded initiative that got under way at the beginning of April in Sydney.

Hosted by the UNSW Business School and driven by the office of the NSW Chief Scientist & Engineer, the NSW Circular Economy Innovation Network got off to an encouraging start with a stakeholders meeting that drew an impressive turnout from businesses across the state.

Panellists at the meeting described a range of initiatives already under way, all of which proved the ethos that one company’s waste is another company’s raw materials.

“There’s no such thing as waste in nature”, said Planet Ark founder and CEO Paul Klymenko, who went on to describe his organisation’s latest online project as “the eBay of B2B waste”, saying that “Procurement managers need to be able to buy these waste streams the same way they procure virgin materials.”

One company that has been particularly proactive in seeking out opportunities is Newcastle-based manufacturer Moly-Cop, which has tapped in to opportunities as diverse as coffee machine pods (using the grounds as fuel and extracting aluminium from the pods), extracting plastics from e-waste streams and extracting steel bracing from car tyres recovered from landfill.

As the company’s Market Development Manager Ian Tooze described it to the meeting, “we look for ways to create commerce”.

If there was one conclusion from the meeting, it was that collaboration will be the key to establishing a circular economy. And, as Ian Hudson, Manager of the Industry Capability Network, put it: “Collaboration is best between disparate parties.”",Australia,2019.04
312,Recycling crisis: Mountains of rubbish pile up as firms call for federal action,"In a cavernous tin shed north of Adelaide, rubbish is piling up high as trucks roll in and tip their loads onto a disorderly heap on the concrete floor.

This is where tonne after tonne of household recycling from yellow-topped bins ends up after it is hauled away from kerbs across the city — milk bottles, cereal boxes, tins, beer cans.

In the 12 months since China stopped taking Australia’s recycling, truckloads of plastic, glass and paper have continued pouring into sorting centres like this one across the country.

It was hoped that the recycling crisis would kick-start a “circular economy” in Australia — where recycling waste piles like this would be processed locally rather than discarded or exported.

But today, some of what households put in the yellow bin is still shipped to alternative offshore markets such as Thailand, Malaysia, India, Vietnam and Indonesia. In fact, we are now sending more of our waste overseas than we did before the China ban.

With recyclers struggling, dozens of councils, most recently in Victoria, have been forced to send material to landfill.

But at the Northern Adelaide Waste Management Authority Resource Recovery Centre (NAWMA), it’s a different story.

The facility is already directing about 80 per cent of its recycling to domestic remanufacturing, a sign that a nascent “circular economy” is taking form regardless of government inaction over the past year.

“We’re going to use a hundred per cent of what our residents put in that yellow-top bin on Australian shores by 2020,” the NAWMA facility’s chief executive, Adam Faulkner told ABC News.

But very soon Australia will be hit with another shock as other export destinations start to close their borders to our waste.

Waste industry experts are warning that the circular economy is not coming fast enough on its own steam.

Just across town, Recycled Plastics Australia general manager Stephen Scherer walks between towering white sacks lined up on pallets in orderly rows.

Each bag is filled to the brim with dark pellets, roughly the size of coffee beans, which are made from scrap household plastics dumped in a yellow-top bin.

These pellets are the building blocks for new plastic products.

They are 90 to 95 per cent pure and can be used to manufacture any plastic goods other than food containers — and at a cost cheaper than virgin plastics.

“It’s filled with their product, their product goes to the supermarket, the consumer takes it home, when they’re finished with it, they put it in their yellow bin.

“The yellow bin gets sorted and comes back to us. So, we can make that a full cycle.”

The RPA plant is one of only a few in the world that can take the lowest form of plastic waste from kerb-side bins and transform it into a highest-quality raw material.

According to Mr Scherer, the factory’s real innovation is in uniting multiple processes to sort, clean and remanufacture plastics all under the one roof.

“What’s extraordinary is that not that many people have figured out how to do it,” Mr Scherer says.

The massive facility — the result of a $20-million investment — is divided into three areas.

The first section is where all non-plastic items are removed.

The waste then moves to the sophisticated sorting process employing a range of different machines that have been put together in a unique way.

One of the techniques involves what’s called an optical sorter.

A light source is reflected off the plastic 400 times a second while a computer recognises the light’s wavelength as a type of plastic.

From there, the plastic is washed again and melted down to form the pellets.

The resulting material is currently sold to several companies including Garden City Plastics, which makes flower pots for nursery growers. It’s been using recycled plastic since it went into business in 1975 and the products it makes are recyclable too.

But despite seemingly cracking one part of the “circular economy” and offering a cheaper product, Mr Scherer says it’s currently hard to find buyers because companies don’t want to take the risk.

He says the Federal Government has been absent from the conversation about waste, while Australians are operating in a culture where “we don’t do what we’re not forced to do”.

“If the Federal Government mandated the use of recycled plastic in packaging, the take-up would be massive,” he says.

“The whole fast-moving consumer goods market would be 100 per cent recycled. It couldn’t afford not to be.”

RPA’s long-term vision is to be adopted by the big brands and to expand into other product ranges, but for now it’s still early days for Australia’s circular economy.

“The product that we are processing now has been going into landfill [until] very recently,” he says, referring to the recent recycling crisis in Victoria.

“Without good destinations, we will go back to landfilling again.”

RPA is not the only business finding a use for recycled plastic. The ACT Government has agreed to its first trial of a suburban road made of recycled materials.

The company behind the technology, Downer, says the new type of asphalt — called Reconophalt — is a better-performing, more-durable product than traditional asphalt.

Reconophalt includes soft plastics such as plastic bags, which aren’t recyclable in yellow bins, and glass sand, which is made locally by crushing recycled glass.

Dante Cremasco, the executive general manager for Downer’s roads division, says the product is the result of 15 years of research and development.

“It’s the willingness of our customers — and these are the government organisations — to embrace sustainable materials,” Mr Cremasco says.

The road project in Canberra cost twice as much as normal, but Downer is taking the hit.

“Obviously we’re charging like we would with a regular exercise, but with anything if we get scale it becomes our norm,” he says.

“These types of products will actually outperform from a cost perspective.”

Gayle Sloan’s frustrations with the lack of Federal Government action are well known.

The Waste Management and Resource Recovery Association of Australia (WMRR) chief executive officer says the 1.2 million tonnes of recyclable materials households are producing could be turned into jobs and investment if the circular economy can only take off.

But since the crisis of a year ago, the Federal Government has “done nothing”.

“We’ve had meetings, we had more meetings, and then we’ve had more talk, and we had no action,” she said.

Mandating the use of recycled material in packaging and construction would mean recyclers could supply a domestic market with scale that would create thousands of jobs.

Ms Sloan says the Federal Government cannot afford to take a hands-off approach and leave regulation to the states.

“The reality is, whether the Federal Government like it or not, we are a common market,” she said.

“Most of the companies are multinationals and work across Australia. They don’t want a response on a state-by-state basis.

“We need a national Government that pulls all the players together from a regulatory, commercial and investment point of view.”

WMRR is calling for tax incentives and a change in the criteria for grants to deal with over-supply and under demand.

“One of the biggest Federal Government grants is to local councils for roads. If they mandated the use of recycled content, boom — there goes demand increasing overnight,” Ms Sloan said.

In a statement, the Environment Minister Melissa Price says the Government has been preparing a National Action Plan.

It is also supporting projects that divert waste from landfill.

The Minister cited the Environment Restoration Fund announced in the budget, which will spend $100 million to provide national leadership on long-term environmental issues including waste and recycling and $22 million to support local community action.

The recycling industry does not see these measures as helping develop a circular economy which will address the 1.2 million tonne surplus of waste, or grow demand for the rubbish sent offshore.

Back in North Adelaide, Adam Faulkner is pressing ahead with his ambitious targets despite the most immediate operational obstacle — the contamination level he’s seeing in people’s yellow bins.

“Our biggest challenge is actually getting our residents to use those bins responsibly,” he says.

Ms Sloan agrees there are major hurdles to overcome with Australian packaging. Consumers need clear labels telling them what’s recyclable and what contains recycled content.

But for now, “Please keep recycling,” she says.

“It is absolutely the right thing to do. We do not want to landfill it.”",Australia,2019.04

It was hoped that the recycling crisis would kick-start a ""circular economy"" in Australia — where recycling waste piles like this would be processed locally rather than discarded or exported.

But today, some of what households put in the yellow bin is still shipped to alternative offshore markets such as Thailand, Malaysia, India, Vietnam and Indonesia. In fact, we are now sending more of our waste overseas than we did before the China ban.

With recyclers struggling, dozens of councils, most recently in Victoria, have been forced to send material to landfill.

But at the Northern Adelaide Waste Management Authority Resource Recovery Centre (NAWMA), it's a different story.

The facility is already directing about 80 per cent of its recycling to domestic remanufacturing, a sign that a nascent ""circular economy"" is taking form regardless of government inaction over the past year.

""We're going to use a hundred per cent of what our residents put in that yellow-top bin on Australian shores by 2020,"" the NAWMA facility's chief executive, Adam Faulkner told ABC News.

But very soon Australia will be hit with another shock as other export destinations start to close their borders to our waste.

Waste industry experts are warning that the circular economy is not coming fast enough on its own steam.

Just across town, Recycled Plastics Australia general manager Stephen Scherer walks between towering white sacks lined up on pallets in orderly rows.

Each bag is filled to the brim with dark pellets, roughly the size of coffee beans, which are made from scrap household plastics dumped in a yellow-top bin.

These pellets are the building blocks for new plastic products.

They are 90 to 95 per cent pure and can be used to manufacture any plastic goods other than food containers — and at a cost cheaper than virgin plastics.

""It's filled with their product, their product goes to the supermarket, the consumer takes it home, when they're finished with it, they put it in their yellow bin.

""The yellow bin gets sorted and comes back to us. So, we can make that a full cycle.""

The RPA plant is one of only a few in the world that can take the lowest form of plastic waste from kerb-side bins and transform it into a highest-quality raw material.

According to Mr Scherer, the factory's real innovation is in uniting multiple processes to sort, clean and remanufacture plastics all under the one roof.

""What's extraordinary is that not that many people have figured out how to do it,"" Mr Scherer says.

The massive facility — the result of a $20-million investment — is divided into three areas.

The first section is where all non-plastic items are removed.

The waste then moves to the sophisticated sorting process employing a range of different machines that have been put together in a unique way.

One of the techniques involves what's called an optical sorter.

A light source is reflected off the plastic 400 times a second while a computer recognises the light's wavelength as a type of plastic.

From there, the plastic is washed again and melted down to form the pellets.

The resulting material is currently sold to several companies including Garden City Plastics, which makes flower pots for nursery growers. It's been using recycled plastic since it went into business in 1975 and the products it makes are recyclable too.

But despite seemingly cracking one part of the ""circular economy"" and offering a cheaper product, Mr Scherer says it's currently hard to find buyers because companies don't want to take the risk.

He says the Federal Government has been absent from the conversation about waste, while Australians are operating in a culture where ""we don't do what we're not forced to do"".

""If the Federal Government mandated the use of recycled plastic in packaging, the take-up would be massive,"" he says.

""The whole fast-moving consumer goods market would be 100 per cent recycled. It couldn't afford not to be.""

RPA's long-term vision is to be adopted by the big brands and to expand into other product ranges, but for now it's still early days for Australia's circular economy.

""The product that we are processing now has been going into landfill [until] very recently,"" he says, referring to the recent recycling crisis in Victoria.

RPA is not the only business finding a use for recycled plastic. The ACT Government has agreed to its first trial of a suburban road made of recycled materials.

The company behind the technology, Downer, says the new type of asphalt — called Reconophalt — is a better-performing, more-durable product than traditional asphalt.

Reconophalt includes soft plastics such as plastic bags, which aren't recyclable in yellow bins, and glass sand, which is made locally by crushing recycled glass.

Dante Cremasco, the executive general manager for Downer's roads division, says the product is the result of 15 years of research and development.

But there's one missing ingredient.

""It's the willingness of our customers — and these are the government organisations — to embrace sustainable materials,"" Mr Cremasco says.

The road project in Canberra cost twice as much as normal, but Downer is taking the hit.

""Obviously we're charging like we would with a regular exercise, but with anything if we get scale it becomes our norm,"" he says.

Gayle Sloan's frustrations with the lack of Federal Government action are well known.

The Waste Management and Resource Recovery Association of Australia (WMRR) chief executive officer says the 1.2 million tonnes of recyclable materials households are producing could be turned into jobs and investment if the circular economy can only take off.

But since the crisis of a year ago, the Federal Government has ""done nothing"".

Mandating the use of recycled material in packaging and construction would mean recyclers could supply a domestic market with scale that would create thousands of jobs.

Ms Sloan says the Federal Government cannot afford to take a hands-off approach and leave regulation to the states.

""The reality is, whether the Federal Government like it or not, we are a common market,"" she said.

""Most of the companies are multinationals and work across Australia. They don't want a response on a state-by-state basis.

""We need a national Government that pulls all the players together from a regulatory, commercial and investment point of view.""

WMRR is calling for tax incentives and a change in the criteria for grants to deal with over-supply and under demand.

In a statement, the Environment Minister Melissa Price says the Government has been preparing a National Action Plan.

It is also supporting projects that divert waste from landfill.

The Minister cited the Environment Restoration Fund announced in the budget, which will spend $100 million to provide national leadership on long-term environmental issues including waste and recycling and $22 million to support local community action.

The recycling industry does not see these measures as helping develop a circular economy which will address the 1.2 million tonne surplus of waste, or grow demand for the rubbish sent offshore.

Back in North Adelaide, Adam Faulkner is pressing ahead with his ambitious targets despite the most immediate operational obstacle — the contamination level he's seeing in people's yellow bins.

""Our biggest challenge is actually getting our residents to use those bins responsibly,"" he says.

Ms Sloan agrees there are major hurdles to overcome with Australian packaging. Consumers need clear labels telling them what's recyclable and what contains recycled content.

But for now, ""Please keep recycling,"" she says.

""It is absolutely the right thing to do. We do not want to landfill it.""",Australia,2019.04
323,"Fight climate change in the streets, shops and casinos","Fight climate change in the streets, shops and casinos

The responsibility for fighting climate change doesn't just rest with farmers - urban businesses and city dwellers need to take action too, writes Rod Oram. He hopes the example of some leading businesses will inspire more companies and urban households to get involved.

“I can cut my emissions by 8 percent, so what are you doing about yours?” a cockie challenged me, a townie, at a recent climate change forum in the Bay of Plenty, an event in its annual Sustainable Backyards programme.

“No worries,” I replied. “We can all do better than that.”

Last week’s column gave examples of farmers working on big emissions reductions. This week’s looks at the other half of our emissions – from transport, industry and our built-environments – which are mostly urban. Next week’s will look at the synergy between the two.

The sense all this is too hard is widespread in town and country.

But once you start looking, all kinds of economically viable opportunities open up. For example, we could cut our energy use and emissions by 20 percent by 2035 by using it more efficiently and relying more on renewables, estimates the Government’s Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority.

- businesses could reduce their energy use by around 19 percent through smarter energy management, more efficient equipment and replacing existing process heating systems with electric technologies;

- households could reduce their energy use by around 20 percent through more efficient space heating, water heating and lighting; and

- transport energy use could be reduced by around 27 percent through more efficient driving practices, improved fuel economy and electric vehicles.

Those reductions, and a similar scale of cuts in agricultural emissions, will give us a good start to being net zero carbon by 2050. That’s the goal all humanity has to achieve if we want to keep changes in climate to manageable levels.

To go all the way, though, we will need radical changes from the 2020s onwards in technologies, energy sources, business models, food production, manufacturing methods, consumption patterns, built environments such as towns and cities and - above all - our values.

In all this we have some advantages many other countries don’t, such as innovative farmers, nimble companies, and abundant sources of renewable energy. Also, our business community is getting its act together better than in many countries. For example, 85 companies with emission reduction commitments have signed up to the Climate Leaders Coalition, an initiative of the Sustainable Business Council. They generate about a quarter of our GDP and half our emissions.

Some of those companies are also members of The Aotearoa Circle which is seeking to put care for and enhancement of our natural capital at the centre of their businesses. We have the highest store of natural resources per capita of all countries except for oil and gas producers. But those fossil fuel economies are utterly unsustainable. Ours, though, will be sustainable if we use our natural capital wisely and renewably.

A good few New Zealand companies have begun that journey. Their progress is modest so far, and their bigger challenges and opportunities are ahead of them. So they deserve encouragement for their ambition, rather than cynicism about their achievements to date.

Here are some examples:

The Warehouse Group has set a goal of reducing its emissions by 2030 by 32 percent from 2015 levels across its domestic business, supply chain and international shipping activities. It had begun measuring and reducing them in its main business in 2009, adding in its subsidiary Noel Leeming and other operations in 2015. It uses the measurement, reduction and certification methodologies of EnviroMark, an NZ based, international leader in the field.

The Warehouse is also one of 51 NZ companies that belong to the Carbon Disclosure Project, an international not-for-profit initiative to encourage measurement and reporting of carbon emissions. In 2018, The Warehouse ranked third equal among NZ firms for carbon disclosure.

To achieve carbon neutrality, The Warehouse is buying Gold Standard international carbon credits to offset emissions generated by the business. One such project invests in improved cookstoves for Bangladeshi families, relieving the hazardous indoor pollution caused by inefficient traditional stoves.

Here, The Warehouse is planning to regenerate 2,700 ha of land back to carbon-sequestering native forests by partnering with Trees That Count, a programme of the conservation charity Project Crimson Trust.

While carbon neutrality is an important first step, the ultimate climate and resource challenge for all companies, not just consumer goods retailers like The Warehouse, is to become true ""circular economy businesses"" in the decades ahead.

A circular economy business is one that ensures everything it makes and sells is completely recyclable so there is no pollution or loss of natural resources. For more on this very demanding discipline, please read this column.

SkyCity Entertainment recently announced it too was aiming to be carbon neutral. It is putting an internal price on carbon (currently $25 a tonne) on all its activities to help incentivise change. It has committed to reducing them by 38 percent by 2030 and 73 percent by 2050 (from 2015 levels). It has also committed that 67 percent of its suppliers by spend, covering purchased goods and services and capital goods, will set targets for emissions reductions by 2023.

Many of SkyCity’s casino, hotel and conference customers travel some distance to its venues. Thus, it could be a leader in carbon neutral tourism if it chose to be. The cost of offsets for air travel, for example, are remarkably affordable. The share of emissions per passenger for flights from London to Auckland return are 6 tonnes for economy class, 9 tonnes for premium economy, and 16 tonnes for business class. At the current price of $25 per tonne, those offsets would cost $150, $225 and $563 respectively, a bargain compared with the UK’s current departure tax of $333 per passenger for long-haul flights.

The figures for Shanghai-Auckland return are 3 tonnes for economy class, 5 tonnes for premium economy, and 8 tonnes for business class. At the current price of $25 per tonne, those offsets would cost $75, $125 and $200 respectively. If the offsets were in a New Zealand native bush regeneration project (such as Hinewai in the Banks Peninsula) then the international visitors would feel they were helping us become a climate responsible nation.

Many more examples of large and small Kiwi companies’ commitments to tackling climate change are on the Climate Leaders Coalition website.

The second area EECA identifies for emissions cuts is in energy used by industry for heat and processing. Again, efficiency is a big first step but the biggest progress will come from replacing coal, gas and fuel oil with renewable energy. In the dairy industry, for example, Synlait and Fonterra have pilot projects for electric powered boilers.

And the third is in transport. For example, EECA’s Low Emission Vehicle Contestable Fund has awarded so far five rounds of support for pilot projects on electric vehicles and other low emission technologies. Case studies on them are here.

EECA also gives advice to members of the public on actions they can take as individuals.

Doing so can be intriguing, satisfying and beneficial, as my family and I’ve found over the past 12 years during which we’ve virtually eliminated carbon emissions from our 75-year-old house, and two cars. For details, please read this column I wrote 18 months ago.

So, for me one of the great mysteries about climate change is the reluctance of many people to act when the benefits of doing so are so great. Hopefully, business exemplars will encourage many more companies and people to get involved.",New Zealand,2019.04
342,New cement products could kickstart the construction industry’s circular economy,"Some members of the building industry have begun developing products that not only reuse and recycle waste, they eliminate it entirely.

Associate Professor Ali Abbas, lead researcher in the Waste Transformation Research Hub at the University of Sydney, is developing one such product — a cement blend that incorporates fly ash and carbon dioxide waste from power plants, as well as glass.

“We are doing research that looks at the interactions between these waste streams towards the final target properties of a concrete product,” Abbas said.

In 2014-15, Australia produced 565 kg per capita of municipal waste, 831 kg of construction and demolition waste, 459 kg of fly ash and 849 kg of other commercial and industrial waste, according to a report for the Department of the Environment and Energy.

The team started off wanting to use carbon dioxide to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which, because of its large quantities, meant focusing on fly ash.

“But now with the waste problem in Australia, we’re looking at other ways that we can use other waste streams like glass and steel slag, which we’ve investigated,” Abbas said.

So far, the team has carried out testing on a lab scale and developed samples to do compressive strength and durability tests.

Abbas said a circular economy philosophy is driving the product’s development — how to design sustainable green cement and how it can be used entirely at the end of its life.

He said this could mean instead of taking the concrete to landfill, it could be easily taken back by a company and reintroduced into new cement and concrete products.

“A lot of the big players and the big companies in Australia are starting to understand the value of circular economy and they’re starting to pick this up,” Abbas said.

383,"Vertical farming, blockchain and the circular economy are bringing 'farm to table' into the 21st century","Your groceries are getting a 21st-century reboot thanks to a new research centre focused on the future of food.

Australia’s population is forecast to hit 30 million by 2029 and reach almost 50 million – double the current population – by 2066. That’s a lot of mouths to feed, and with most of this growth concentrated in cities, the question needs to be asked: how can food production keep pace?

A new Future Food Systems Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) has received funding to the tune of $35 million to help answer that question over the course of the next decade.

The new CRC will focus on advanced food manufacturing, as well as how the sector can be more sustainable as Australia’s population continues to grow.

Modern food production faces problems on many fronts. Growing populations demand increased output. Meanwhile, fewer people are choosing a life on the land, and climate change will create obstacles, some of which are hard to predict.

Minister for Industry, Science and Technology Karen Andrews said the new Future Food Systems CRC is designed to help Australia stay on the front foot in this area by bringing industry and research together.

“What we have to do is make sure we are looking towards the future and we’re clear what the issues are that we need to address,” she said at the launch event at UNSW.

These challenges include boosting the productivity of regional and peri-urban food systems, making it easier for innovators to bring their prototypes to market, and managing farm-to-table supply chains with extreme accuracy.

The CRC will initially work with regional stakeholders in six ‘food hubs’ to apply the latest innovations in advanced manufacturing, logistics and food science to farms, greenhouse complexes, factories and freight.

Besides putting food on local tables, streamlining food systems and making them more sustainable would place Australia in a good position to become the breadbasket of Asia.

“If I look at food in particular, we have almost half of the world’s population directly north of us … Australia is ideally located to play a key role in this area,” Andrews said.

This investment comes with opportunities for engineers who are interested in the intersection of food and technology. From genetic engineering to robotics, there are myriad forms this research can take. UNSW Engineering Dean Professor Mark Hoffman said this will be achieved through partnerships between engineers, technologists and primary producers.

“This CRC will move Australia into a new era of high-technology food production, transforming one of our most important industries and reinforcing our place as a major world food producer,” Hoffman said.

Plans are already in place for developing high-tech agrifood precincts in Liverpool, NSW, and Peel, WA. The Liverpool precinct will be developed in parallel with the new Aerotropolis in western Sydney. Developing these precincts includes providing design and circular economy solutions for water and energy use.

The Future Food Systems CRC website states it will partner with major growers and technology entrepreneurs to develop indoor and vertical farming facilities to increase the amount of food production taking place near existing infrastructure. Developing indoor urban agriculture could be worth up to $395 billion globally by 2030, according to a Food Innovation Australia report.

Circular economy solutions like water recycling, renewable energy and water management will facilitate this. Blockchain platforms and automation will also make an appearance as the CRC works with freight and logistics providers to get goods from A to B.

Queensland University of Technology’s Professor Doug Baker, who is also involved in the project, said there needs to be more integration between planning policy, design and infrastructure, and high-tech growing facilities around transport hubs.

“It’s about being smarter with agriculture and infrastructure, and integrating technology and robotics into that,” he said.

He said an example of a well-integrated future food system was automated, vertical-farming greenhouses located near airports or ports so crops could be picked, packed and shipped with minimal fuss.

Dr Chris Lehnert, a robotics researcher at the Australian Centre for Robotic Vision, sees enormous potential for robotics and automation in future food systems, particularly indoor protected cropping.

“The future potential of robotics in indoor protected cropping will be their ability to intelligently sense, think and act in order to reduce production costs and maximise output value in terms of crop yield and quality,” he said.

To further build this capability, the CRC will support 60 PhD students and train future generations interested in using technology to create more sustainable food production systems.

This funding, which will be doled out over the next decade, is on top of $149.6 million the CRC has previously received from more than 60 industry partners interested in this work.",Australia,2019.04

In particular, we will ask how indigenous knowledge can inform and guide us in this radical shift towards a global circular economy.

The Pacific Summit will focus on three themes:

Mātauranga: What new approaches can we unlock when contemporary economics meets indigenous worldviews?

Materials: How can we use experience and inspiration from the Pacific, where the issue of plastics pollution is complex, urgent and visible, to design a better system in which plastics never become waste?

Manifestos: Pacific states are geographically dispersed and culturally diverse, yet these are the very features that unite them. How can leaders harness this unique role and take collective action towards a shared vision for an economy that works in the long term?

Speakers and panellists include Hon. Eugenie Sage, Minister for Conservation, New Zealand; Traci Houpapa, Chairman, Federation of Maori Authorities; Leota Kosi Latu, Director General, Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme; Dr Chris Kutarna, Fellow, University of Oxford; Andrew Morlet, CEO, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, as well as business leaders, entrepreneurs, and many others.

507,Designing a new solution to our waste crisis,"Creating new materials from waste products is essential if we’re to solve the global recycling, waste and emissions crisis.

If they don’t know it already, designers of all types will soon be at the forefront of a new recycling ethos in Australia and around the world.

For too long products of all kinds have been designed without consideration of the environmental consequences of their disposal.

The burden of what to do with all of the unwanted items in our households has fallen to consumers and local councils in the ‘down-stream’ part of the life cycle of products via bin collections and waste sorting.

Many of these waste materials are ending up in landfill and causing damaging greenhouse gases, and if the world keeps doing this, the waste crisis experienced in Australia since China last year and now India this year banned the importation of international waste, will become critical.

The reality is that much of the waste that ends up in landfill is actually a renewable resource. This has been proved in our labs at the Sustainable Materials Research and Technology Centre at UNSW Sydney through our microrecycling science and with our prototype green microfactory technology.

For instance, we are producing building panels from old clothing and textiles, as well as from coffee grounds and cups, and even from glass and saw dust. We are also extracting from electronic waste such as printers, computers and mobile phones the valuable metal alloys they contain and from the plastics we can produce high quality filament for 3D printing.

And we need to do this if we want to achieve a ‘circular economy’ which minimises waste by ensuring that the valuable resources contained in waste and discarded products are kept in use for as long as possible. For instance, metals can be reformed over and over ad infinitum while glass and even plastics can also be reformed and re-used many times depending on quality.

But it is not just the designers of products in the so called ‘up-stream’ part of our market places, it is the producers and manufacturers of their products and services in the ‘mid-stream’ that must also play a key role in creating a true circular economy.

A key problem is there is little commercial appetite to ensure we divert from landfill the waste that can be reformed into new, valued-added materials, products and manufacturing feedstock.

To that end, the NSW Government has announced in 2019 via its Office of Chief Scientist and Engineer funding to be awarded to UNSW Sydney to establish the Circular Economy Innovation Network, to which I’ve been appointed Director.

There are so many stakeholders across all supply chains that the challenge is to work together to find the opportunities to make changes that not only reduce waste but to ensure it can be valued and used over and over as a renewable resource to create a circular economy.

If designers and producers of products, packaging and applicable services accounted for and built in, from the very beginning of the product lifecycle, a consideration for how all of the materials in products will become part of the circular economy so they do not have to end up in landfill, then we may have a positive impact on addressing the world’s growing waste problem.

For example, using a modular design means that if a part of a product breaks, a replacement component could be made from 3D printing technology from filament made from recovered quality plastic so the whole product is not thrown in the bin. This reduces waste, the need to mine finite resources and the associated environmental impacts and costs of transportation and processing.

Some designers and producers are now making products from waste resources that otherwise would have gone to the tip and produced green house gases – high-end furniture, is one example. In our labs, we work with various industry partners and one is Dresden which makes prescription glasses and has a mission to do it sustainably using recycled and recyclable plastics materials. Our researchers are helping them by testing the viability of using plastics from things like discarded fishing netting, plastic bags and plastic lids.

The new Circular Economy Innovation Network will bring together key stakeholders and case studies to accelerate partnerships and opportunities to build the circular economy not just in NSW but across Australia to address the waste and recycling issue, while enhancing manufacturing and industry capability to create new jobs.

Workshops, seminars and identifying market opportunities and new partnerships with researches, industry and governments, will be some of the key activities and I am excited to be leading this exciting new initiative.

It’s a big challenge to create a Network like this to bring together all of the touchpoints along business supply chains to help build a true circular economy, but we must act now for the future.

Let me give you some stark statistics and facts.

The clothing and textiles industry is the second most polluting sector in the world, accounting for 10% of the world's total carbon emissions. That clothing is now one of the biggest consumer waste streams, with 92 million tons estimated to be thrown out in a year, means we must urgently and seriously consider new ways to deal with unwanted clothes.

Much of the materials collected from kerbside recycling bins has been going to developing nations and in Australia that gets ticked off as ‘recycled’ but much of it ends up in landfill or burnt. And due to the China and Indian waste importation bans, recyclable materials around Australian are being stockpiled and going into local landfill. Other Asian countries are also getting sick of being the Australia and the world’s dumping grounds.

UNSW’s own research shows 65.4% of people believe recyclables put into council bins goes to landfill (69.5% female, 51.4% aged 18-34, 75.1% aged 65-plus); 49% of people believe green and ecofriendly efforts will not have an effect in their lifetime; 63.8% of those aged 65-plus see no benefits being realised; and 72.4% of people would recycle more if the material was reliably recycled.

So, when considering that the population growth trend is expected to continue in the following decades, from a current world population of 7.6 billion to approximately 9.8 billion by 2050, our resources globally and at home need to be preserved and re-used.

Smart design and production in a new ‘circular economy’ can make a big difference.

541,Glass in resort to be recycled finally,"Clean glass separated into the new bins will be sent to a bottle manufacturer in Auckland for recycling, Queenstown’s council has confirmed this week.

Mountain Scene revealed back in 2016 that all glass diligently placed into mixed recycling bins by residents was actually being sent to the Victoria Flats landfill in Gibbston.

Some 36 tonnes of glass from residential properties is sent to landfill each week – about 1870 tonnes a year. That figure doubles when commercial waste from businesses, which is collected privately, is taken into account.

Three years down the track, new waste contracts have been signed with Waste Management New Zealand Ltd, in conjunction with Wanaka’s Waste Busters.

They’ll also be managing the Queenstown Materials Recovery Facility, in Frankton, together with the refuse transfer stations in Queenstown and Wanaka.

Before 2016, Queenstown’s glass was ‘recycled’, but into roading aggregate.

Now, it will be properly recycled. It will be turned back into glass bottles and jars at Auckland’s O-I NZ, which is New Zealand’s only glass bottle and jar manufacturer.

Each household now has three bins – a 140-litre bin for glass recycling, a larger 240l bin for mixed recyclables and a 140l bin for waste to landfill. Collections begin July 1.

About 54,000 new bins are being delivered to homes across the district.

Council contract manager Laura Gledhill says: “Separated, clean glass will be transported to Auckland for processing into new glass products, such as bottles and jars, creating a circular economy in New Zealand for the glass that is collected in Queenstown.

“For this to work, it’s important that the new glass recycling wheelie bins must only have glass in them – bottles and jars only, with no lids.

“No other types of glass (for example, window panes) can go into those bins and there should definitely be no other materials such as general waste or plastic recyclables.”

Recyclable materials that are placed into the yellow bins will be taken to the existing materials recovery facility in Glenda Drive, Frankton, where they will be sorted and processed.

Processed materials will then be sold to New Zealand or overseas customers for re-processing into new prod-ucts.

Ensuring minimum or zero contamination is essential to the whole endeavour.

“We’re asking the community to take extra care to not contaminate the material in the yellow bins with general waste (for example, foodwaste) or any non-approved materials.”",New Zealand,2019.05
556,Residents crying foul over proposed waste facility,"MEMBERS of a residents action group are raising their voices in opposition to the establishment of a new Ipswich waste facility, concerned with the proximity to homes.

A resource recovery centre at New Chum has been proposed by Jackal Renewables.

The company want to develop the subject site over time into a recycling hub with an integrated resource centre and waste-to-energy cogeneration plant.

Activities undertaken at the site would include the manufacturing of mineral mulch and EasySpread from fibre cement by-product and the treatment of acid sulphate soils.

READ: REMONDIS'S PLEA TO ALLOW AN INCINERATOR IN THE COMMUNITY

A waste transfer station for construction and demolition waste streams would be established, as would a co-generation plant to produce electricity.

The window for submissions and objections to be sent to Ipswich City Council closes today.

Jackal renewables director Rob Howe said the centre would take waste generated and ""save it from Ipswich's landfill"" in an effort to reduce demand for new landfill sites in the area.

The small family-owned company has been operating locally for a decade, primarily recycling cement sheeting into agricultural soil enhancer.

Mr Howe said the company had always operated as ""a good neighbour and with a clear conscience.""

He believes the centre would establish Ipswich as a key player in renewables' processing.

""We work in the circular economy; our aim is to take waste and re-use or recycle it to create a positive environmental balance,"" Mr Howe said.

""We are in the business of resource recycling. We are also the landowner and it is in our best interest to look after our own backyard.

""Every aspect of our business is heavily scrutinised by many levels of government and we have always ensured that we not only meet environmental regulations but sit well under the compliance limits.

""Our air modelling and noise studies confirm we will be within the environmental compliance guidelines. We ensured the modelling involved land zoned for future residential use; not just the areas currently occupied by homes.""

The energy needed to run the operation will be produced on-site and the company aims to grow a team of five people to 11 local roles in the next few years.

Ipswich Residents Against Toxic Environment president Jim Dodrill said the big issue was the location of the facility.

""It's only 500-600m from, not one house, but literally hundreds of homes in Collingwood Park,"" Mr Dodrill said.

""I don't want to come across, and nor does anyone in the group, as anti-industry or anti-development.

""But there's a right and a wrong place to put these things. It's totally unsuitable. It can be approached from the New Chum industrial area but it also backs onto a residential area in Collingwood Park.""

He said the potential impact on nearby residents and the environment, particularly Six Mile Creek, if the operation did not follow regulations were fuelling the objections.

""They'll be creating air pollution... and it's a type of air pollution that has the potential to adversely affect people's health,"" he said.

""They're also talking bringing in 100s of tonnes at a time of acid sulphate soil.

""As you take it out of water and expose it to air it crates sulphuric acid. That sulphuric acid has the potential to leech into the ground and into Six Mile Creek because the site actually backs onto the creek.

""Sulphuric acid will wipe out any fish life, anything that's in the creek. Where there have been acid sulphate leaks into creeks around the world it has caused devastation in the water ways.""

Mr Howe said their modelling studies confirmed the project will be within the environmental compliance guidelines.

""If we, as a society, don't do anything to embrace industrial ecology, we are left with a bleak future of searching for the next landfill site,"" he said.

""We won't accept any materials onto the site that have an offensive odour.

""Acid sulfate soil brought to our site for treatment will be neutralised using cement sheet products, creating a high-quality soil.

""Our stormwater studies have confirmed that all run-off from the processing areas, including areas where acid sulfate soil will be treated, will be captured by the existing clay pit on site. There will be no run-off into Six Mile Creek. Any water accumulated in our clay pit will be regularly monitored.""",Australia,2019.05
592,Circular economy ideas inspire,"Gisborne businesses have ways and means to transform the regional economy to a totally sustainable mode after they were left inspired from a conference.

Activate Tairawhiti, the region’s economic development agency, hosted a two-day conference earlier this month, to explore how a “circular economy” — underpinned by the use of renewable energy and providing a sustainable, viable and low carbon alternative — could replace a traditional economic model.

Activate Tairawhiti chairman John Rae said the conference was a definite success.

“Tairawhiti really got behind the event and mana whenua Ngati Oneone’s support made it all the more connected for all involved — especially being able to host the conference at Te Poho o Rawiri Marae.”

Activate Tairawhiti TEAP (Tairawhiti Economic Action Plan) programme manager and conference organiser Harley Dibble said Mr Rae kicked off a stellar conference line-up.

“We were privileged to host such a world-class, inspirational line-up of international, national and local presenters and the public response both at the conference and in the media shows that.”

“Activate Tairawhiti has signalled its support for facilitating businesses transitioning to a circular economy,” Mr Dibble said.

“There is undoubtedly potential for Tairawhiti to do so. We have the means and opportunity to make it happen.”

Attendees praised the conference as a “proactive and forward-thinking” move for the region.

They also said it was “world class and inspiring”.

Many of the attendees expressed the mix of emotions that they experienced at the conference, with one noting the “precarious future” traditional models were creating for our children.

Others even expressed “shock, panic and grief” about what climate change meant for species loss, pollution and resource consumption.

Mr Dibble said 160 people registered for the event, with 100 attending on the first day and 80 on the second half day.

“Another highlight was an evening presentation by Riversun, open to all attendees.

“Managing director Geoff Thorpe spoke to more than 40 attendees about Riversun’s journey to be truly sustainable by 2020. Most exciting is their carboNZero accreditation, achieved late last year.

“They are the first and only local business in Tairawhiti Gisborne to hold this certification and attendees were inspired and surprised to hear how cost- effective carboNZero certification, is at only 0.1 percent of Riversun’s gross revenue.”

Activate Tairawhiti economic development general manager Steve Breen said he was particularly enthused about the amount of community engagement involved and the subsequent momentum that generated.

“Specifically, conference presentations and panel discussions will inform several workstreams including; the He Huarahi Hei Whai Oranga - Tairawhiti Economic Action Plan (TEAP) refresh, Gisborne District Council’s spatial planning process, Eastland Community Trust’s Tairawhiti Wellbeing Framework development and the Ministry for the Environment’s investigation into circular economy opportunities in Tairawhiti and Bay of Plenty.

“Activate Tairawhiti have committed to lead the overall regional conversation with follow-up events. We are excited to announce that off the back of the conference’s success, conference sponsor Massey University has partnered with Activate Tairawhiti to do this.”

AT would also look to maximise the wider business support opportunities provided as a member of the Sustainable Business Network.

Mr Dibble said that for those unable to attend, presentations had been recorded.

“Presenter clips will be online, so keep an eye on the AT website for more information in the coming weeks, says Mr Dibble.

“Conference attendees are already requesting copies, which just shows how impactful the presentations were. We can’t wait to share them with even more of our communities.”

630,Waste sector on 'cusp of big shift',"Grassroots groups and the Government came together in Queenstown on Friday night to talk about local environmental issues and national policy.

Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage spoke at length to members of various Wakatipu environmental groups and activists during an evening of ""Kai and Conversations"" at the Queenstown Bowling Club.

Ms Sage said there was ""a huge need for change"" in the waste sector.

""We've had years of very little thought about what happens to products at the end of their lives, very little thought about a circular economy, but we're now on the cusp of a big shift there.""

Ms Sage spoke at the Plastics New Zealand conference earlier that day. She said designers were now thinking about the circular economy at the start of the process

""what materials are being used, how can they be recovered and reused"".

The event was hosted by Sustainable Queenstown, which includes various initiatives such as ""Dishrupt"", which aims to stop the use of single-use plastics at events.

Ms Sage used that as an example of good grassroots work which had been crucial to changing political will across various environmental areas.

She said her priority was increasing the landfill tax.

""It's only $10 a ton, which doesn't really create an incentive to divert waste from landfill, and only applies to 11% of our more than 400 landfills.

""We want to ensure it applies to all landfills, to raise the rate progressively, so there'll be a discussion document in the next two months to see public submissions on that.

""Why that is important is all the revenue raised from the landfill tax goes into the Waste Minimisation Fund, and that funds community organisations, progressive business and councils to do waste-minimisation work.""

It raised about $30million a year at present, half of which went to councils.

The Queenstown Lakes District Council signed a new waste services contract recently to improve its recycling rates. About 54,000 new bins are being delivered and from July 1 glass, recyclables and landfill will be collected separately.

China's initiative to ban waste from other countries was creating ""some problems here, but also a huge opportunity"" and money from the increased tax could be used to increase New Zealand's ability to re-process its own waste, Ms Sage.

The Government was also investigating product stewardship schemes for tyres, e-batteries, refrigerants and agri-chemicals, and also a container deposit scheme.

Ms Sage said she was ""overawed"" by the number of predator-control groups in the Wakatipu.

""That's what inspires me, that so many New Zealanders are now getting really enthusiastic about protecting our indigenous plants and wildlife through getting involved and controlling the predators, which are one of the major threats.""

655,Timor-Leste aims to become world’s first plastics-neutral country,"The Government of Timor-Leste has today signed a memorandum of understanding at the University of Sydney with Mura Technology for the development of a $US40 million chemical recycling plant that will allow Timor-Leste to become the first 'plastics-neutral' economy in the world.

Mura will assist in establishing the chemical recycling plant via a new not-for-profit organisation, RESPECT, at no cost to the people of Timor-Leste. All financial surpluses from the plant will be returned to support community initiatives, as well as developing livelihoods for waste collectors.

Timor-Leste’s Secretary of State for the Environment, Demetrio do Amaral de Carvalho, said: ""This is an exciting collaboration for us. Not only will it make a big difference in plastic waste reduction and reduce harm to our cherished marine life, but Timor-Leste can be an example to the rest of the world about what this technology can achieve and the benefits it will have for the planet.""

The breakthrough chemical recycling technology developed in Australia is called the Catalytic Hydrothermal Reactor (or Cat-HTR). The Cat-HTR platform is being commercialised by Licella Holdings, a start-up co-founded by Professor Thomas Maschmeyer of the University of Sydney and Dr Len Humphreys, Licella CEO.

Mura, which developed the agreement with Timor-Leste, is a joint venture between Licella Holdings and Armstrong Energy of the UK. Plastic Oceans UK has recently signed a memorandum of collaboration with Mura.

The new plant in Timor-Leste will allow for the creation of a circular economy for plastic waste for the benefit of Timor-Leste and the environment. The not-for-profit organisation RESPECT will serve as a model for how developing countries worldwide can tackle plastic waste issues.",Australia,2019.05
714,"Dear planet, how long have we got?","Dear planet, how long have we got?

Pat Baskett considers what it feels like for young people to face turning their lives around to save the planet from environmental collapse

If I were 14 instead of 74 I would be pretty depressed after last week. Another 220sq km of good food-producing land in Taranaki is to be potentially wrecked so that we can continue to drive, fly and live the way we always have.

My 14-year-old’s eyes would have been caught by the title of the conference, the Just Transition Summit, at which these new permits for oil and gas exploration were announced. She understands that we need to go through a transition period but her impatience for this to start is obvious. New permits – on land as opposed to the ban on new ocean permits – seem like a step backwards.

She also understands the positioning of the word “just” because she understands that climate change is linked to the rise of inequality and economic injustice. She is suspicious of large corporations and has read that in some parts of the world – Germany, for example – communities have taken charge of their electricity supply by installing photovoltaics on their roofs. In Denmark, where wind provides about 40 percent of electricity, three quarters of the turbines are owned cooperatively.

If we decentralised electricity and increased other forms of renewables than hydro, she wonders, would we be able to reach 100 percent renewable by the time she is old enough to afford an electric vehicle?

She had hoped the Zero Carbon Amendment Bill would express the urgency she and her friends have been trying to impress upon their parents (and grandparents). Then she had a tantrum when she read the summary. What do they mean, carbon neutral by 2050, she stormed.

I sympathised. By 2050 a whole generation of 14-year-olds will be 45. By then an increase of two degrees is likely to make summers even here unbearable. We have to do it by 2030, she screamed!

She and her peers have done their homework. They know we in New Zealand are way behind. In the UK, where parliament declared a climate emergency on May 1, emissions have fallen 38 percent since 1990. Ours have risen by 20 percent - despite our 80 percent renewable electricity.

This abysmal fact reflects another – that while many individuals, businesses and local councils are doing their best, they are unsupported at the national level.

The Sustainable Business Network has grown to 588 members. Its core aim is the establishment of a circular economy, reducing the ecological impact of their operations and their greenhouse gas emissions. In a truly circular economy, resources are never abandoned as waste.

Auckland could be $8.8 billion better off by 2030 if the city made the transition to a circular economy, the Network claims.

The Climate Leaders Coalition, another organisation established to inspire and connect businesses whose aim is to reduce their emissions, was launched in July 2018. Its membership includes the CEOs of 85 enterprises. Its goal is “to help New Zealand transition to a low emissions economy and, in doing so, create a positive future….”

Local government leaders have a similar organisation which invites mayors to sign the Mayoral Declaration on Climate Change. So far, 59 mayors have signed with 19 yet to decide. The document commits councils to promoting walking, cycling and public transport, to improving energy efficiency and supporting renewable electricity and electric cars.

Will the Zero Carbon bill ultimately deliver policies to unify the country and urgently follow these leads? How long will it take? The more important question is, how long have we got?

Ok, agriculture is a problem. But so is transport. In Auckland we have recently received two stern warnings: traffic congestion is going to get worse and with it the quality of the air we breathe.

Auckland Council research released in December shows how appallingly polluted the air is in some parts of the city. Black carbon, particulate matter from diesel fumes, has been recorded at levels two to three times' higher than in comparable cities in Europe and North America. Nitrogen oxide concentrations in Quay Street are close to, or exceeding, World Health Organisation recommended levels.

We could learn from London’s example. To cut emissions and clean up the air they’ve increased the cost of driving into the CBD by legislating an ultra-low emission zone, or ULEZ, which came into force on April 8. The new legislation sits on top of the existing congestion charge for entering the CBD. It affects owners of diesel cars and vans whose engines are not certified to the latest Euro 6 standard, as well as most petrol cars more than 14 years old.

Motorists of such vehicles will have to pay both charges, meaning it will cost almost $50 to drive into central London between 7am to 6pm. The charge will be enforced by using number plate recognition and a data base which includes every vehicle’s emission standards.

If this can work with London’s millions of vehicles, why not in our cities? The preliminary requirement, of course, would be to set meaningful vehicle emission standards, for air pollution and fuel efficiency. The benefits would be several.

Restrictions on vehicle access to congested areas would clean up the air, lower our GHG emissions and force us to reconfigure how we move around.

Or, knowing that we need to use our fuel supply wisely, and aware of the very few years we have in which to ensure climate stability, we could adopt the war-time strategy of rationing it while we work on renewables.

So to methane. We know that what we do in the next 10 years is crucial. We also know that methane is 84 times more powerful than CO2 in the first two decades after its release. The reduction suggested by the latest report of the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, Simon Upton, is only 10 percent by 2030.

Sure, farmers need support. But are they blinded by the ethos of industrialised agriculture which promises financial rewards for huge herd numbers, nitrogenous fertilisers and bought-in feeds? There are farmers who have reduced herds by 20 percent, need little or no fertilisers, feed no more than the grass in the paddocks and have overall increased profits and lower emissions.

The collateral benefits of government encouragement and support for these actions would be cleaner rivers and healthier cows.

Ten years, the most likely time we have to turn our lives around, seems a mere blink to me. For teens, it stretches ahead like an open road leading they know not quite where.",New Zealand,2019.05
719,Recycling plan just 'eco-babble' - National,"National is slamming the Government's eight-point recycling plan as ""eco-babble"".

The programme includes an education campaign and reviewing kerbside collection and processing. It was revealed on Friday by Associate Environment Minister Eugenie Sage.

A taskforce was set up last year after China banned the importing of many recyclable materials.

""The taskforce looked at how our resource recovery system is functioning, how we can support more onshore processing of recyclables, and help New Zealand shift to a circular economy approach where products are better designed so that more materials can be recovered and re-used,"" said Sage.

“As a country we have been sending our waste issues offshore. China's National Sword initiative has been a wake-up call that we need to deal with waste here in New Zealand.""
• No plans for New Zealand to ban polystyrene - Government
• A complete guide to what you can and can't recycle in New Zealand

""Such as the soft plastic recycling scheme that has been run by the Packaging Forum, we'd be putting a lot more effort into supporting businesses, like Flight Plastics in Wellington,"" he told Newshub.

New Zealand is one of the highest producers of household waste in the developed world, per capita.

Simpson described Sage's plan as as ""eco-babble.""

""This is a minister that is bogged down in environmental theory, and doesn't seem to be able to get to a practical solution on anything.""

China's policy shift has had serious impacts Down Under. Recyclable material in Australia is being wasted and ending up in landfill. There has been unacceptable stockpiling of certain materials, and exportation of materials to other countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand which has led to reports of improper management. This advertising feature is sponsored by the following business. Click the link to learn more: Australia can and should be processing this material onshore in Australia to create a fully integrated circular economy, according to Kevin Daly, co-owner and director of Central Waste Station at Kurri Kurri. Central Waste is a fully integrated resource recovery facility providing waste disposal and waste collection services (all sizes of skip bins and also semi-trailer tipper and tanker services). ""We specialise in construction and demolition (C&D) as well as commercial and industrial (C&I) waste and can process up to 800 tonnes per day through our fully mechanised resource recovery plant,"" Mr Daly said. ""Heavy materials such as concrete and brick are crushed and screened onsite to produce a range of construction materials that are sold back into the industry as recycled product. ""We also undertake offsite project recycling initiatives including concrete and rock crushing to recover valuable resources."" Central Waste provides a full waste disposal and recycling service to the construction industry and local and national waste management groups. Locally, its valued customers include the manufacturing sector, councils and residential customers. ""Our customers operate right across the local economy including housing and industrial construction projects, major demolition and remediation projects, commercial manufacturing and general industrial customers,"" Mr Daly said. Legally, in NSW, waste must only be taken to a licensed waste facility. ""Waste that goes to landfill in NSW (within the metropolitan levy zone) is subject to a government levy of $141.20 per tonne. ""Materials can't be stockpiled beyond certain limits in NSW which has impacted some operators due to the ""Green Curtain"". ""When recyclable or re-usable materials are recovered for an authorised use, the recovered material is not subject to the landfill levy and this supports the viability of recycling,"" Mr Daly said. ""Recycled products are then sold back to the construction industry providing a full circular economy."" Central Waste has invested significant capital into its large scale resource recovery facility to ensure processes are fully mechanised which has increased volumes of waste sorted to recover recyclable components. ""Investment has allowed us to recover in the order of 80% of the material received at our facility,"" Mr Daly said. ""This recovery rate will increase over the coming years to an estimated 98% through the introduction of further processing using new technologies. Through further investment Mr Daly is confident that Central Waste will become a key piece of regional resource recovery infrastructure, able to provide local councils with a superior option for processing of dry municipal waste.

864,Ban on single-use plastic shopping bans takes effect tomorrow across all retailers,"The ban on single-use plastic shopping bags which takes effect tomorrow will cover all retailers.

Associate Environment Minister Eugenie Sage says this is a step towards healthier oceans and giving nature a hand.

""New Zealanders are proud of our country's clean, green reputation and want to help ensure we live up to it. Ending the use of single-use plastic shopping bags helps do that,"" Ms Sage said.

""The ban should ensure less plastic ends up in rivers, streams, storm water systems and the ocean so seabirds, fish, turtles, and marine mammals are less vulnerable to being harmed by it.""

She says banning single-use plastic bags is just one step in tackling New Zealand's waste issues.

""We also need to recharge our materials recovery and recycling systems and shift to a circular economy,"" she says.

Mainstream supermarkets have already made the move away from single-use plastic bags.

It will lead to collapse of fish stocks, water scarcity, soil erosion, air pollution, global deforestation, biodiversity loss and the list goes on. The circular economy is now core policy for a growing number of countries with leadership from Finland, the European Union and Canada, but it is also taking a strong hold in Asia as Japan and China implement circular economic policies to transition them to a sustainable inclusive future. Japan is expected to take this agenda to the G20 meeting it’s hosting later this week. Here in Australia small steps are being taken, spurred on by the waste crisis, Australian cities and state governments like South Australia, NSW and Queensland have started their policy journey. In February, the NSW government released its circular economy policy statement and discussion paper, the South Australian and Victorian governments are developing circular economy policies and action plans, to be finalised next year, and South Australia is implementing its plan. But the Australian government needs to manage the transition with clear policy and targets.

Earlier this month, the World Circular Economy Forum held its third annual meeting in Helsinki

Finland with 2,000 business, government and industry leaders from 90 countries around the world. The theme was Scale It Up because large-scale investment is now required to follow through on this critical market transformation. The EU and countries like Finland have clear targets to meet. Finland will be 100 per cent circular by 2030, it is now in delivery mode. The value of reusing waste needs to be recognised. At the moment circular businesses and services make up just 9 per cent of all economic activity – not a lot, but it is growing fast. The race is on to realise the trillion-dollar value of this new economy. High income countries are leading the way and ensuring the transition is fair and inclusive. People who lose jobs from the old linear economy will need support to reskill and critical investment in Next-Gen circular infrastructure must occur.

Here in Australia we need to move. And the federal government needs to take the lead. Regulatory change is urgent and overdue, our utility and mobility markets need to be opened to new circular solutions. This will require more regulatory action to put a value on previously undervalued outcomes such as reusing waste, preserving drinking water in our dams, or reducing vehicles from the roads. Industry needs to play its part. Capital investment is needed in new local and distributed infrastructure and services. We need local waste collection and sorting systems, water recycling and renewable energy networks, shared mobility infrastructure. We need to get waste classified as a resource and then connect in with countries setting up sustainable reuse infrastructure. But this is not just about waste and recycling - circular economy is an economic solution, and it’s the most powerful one we have.

If we continue to consume resources as we have since the industrial revolution our economy will soon stall, if we want our economy to continue to grow, driving jobs and improving our quality of life, we will need to re-think and embrace a circular economy. The circular economy will grow and develop in ways that are highly profitable. Already new goods and services are emerging from recycling and sharing business models, such as subscription electronics and fashion and shared mobility. New revenue streams are developing as sharing and reuse significantly extends the market value of products, keeping them in the market longer, creating jobs and value. And profits are being made, with the circular economy in Europe estimated at $2.9 trillion by 2030 and $15 trillion in Asia. But to realise these and other benefits we must change our thinking, we simply must take into account the inherent and hidden costs of linear solutions. We need to put a value on natural capital to make a solid economic case not just about our Gross Domestic Product but also to value our resource assets and understand the costs of depletion of natural capital. If we pay attention to these costs and get cost structures right we will make the right decisions – like local waste and water reuse, not transporting long distances or pumping it out to sea. This will reduce costs and bills and help enhance biodiversity and trees, making properties more valuable. And like getting the right foods in the right packaging, to avoid unnecessary waste.",Australia,2019.06
46,Can Australia become the next circular economy superpower?,"As the global economy prepares for 9.8 billion people by 2050, it’s clear our linear economy is reaching the end of its life.

Global economic leaders are now planning for a world circular economy to decouple economic growth from resource use. G20 leaders will hear about the circular economy when they are hosted by Japan – a global circular economy leader – later this month.

It’s no secret our global over-consumption economy will come to the end of its life and we need a Plan B.

Currently, our economy is built on single use “take, make and dispose” principles involving extracting resources, making products, using them once or only a short time, then disposing of them.

A circular economy keeps products and materials in use in the market longer, through sharing, repairing and reusing.

It is about changing the way we produce, assemble, sell and use products to minimise waste and to reduce our environmental impact. It is about valuing our resources, by getting as much use out of products and materials as possible and reducing the amount of waste we generate.

In 2015, the World Resources Forum Asia Pacific held in Sydney estimated the value of a circular economy to Australia could be around AU$26 billion per year by 2025. More work is underway now to quantify the Australian opportunity, but if the European ($AUD2.9 trillion) and China ($AUD15 trillion) opportunities are any indication, it will not be insignificant.

Circular businesses are highly profitable. Sharing and reuse significantly extends the market value of products, keeping them in the market longer, creating jobs, value and multiple new revenue streams.

Australia is already experiencing this transition as new sharing and reuse business models enter the market.

Yet Australia’s infrastructure and services remain wedded to centralised business models that are up to 75 years old, and promote a linear, throwaway and flush-and- forget approach to resources.

This “business as usual” is supported by outdated policy, legislation, regulation and tariff structures.

BAU economic strategy is experiencing its biggest change in centuries. Overconsumption will no longer guarantee our economic success, we need new systems to grow our economy and maintain our high standards of living within the limits of earth’s resource capacity.

To transition will require market reshaping and regulatory, policy and tariff changes that take into account the inherent and hidden costs of linear solutions along with the value of circularity.

Like redefining waste to be a resource, placing a value on removing vehicles from the road, preserving drinking water and reducing fossil dependent fuels.

We also need urgent research and leadership from the federal government and state treasuries to build on the work of the states in embedding circular economy policy into financial policy.

The circular economy will not work as a siloed waste strategy, it needs to be led by federal and state treasuries.

The World Circular Economy Forum held this month in Helsinki is working with the World Economic Forum to scale up the circular economy from the current 10 per cent global economic activity to 100 per cent.

To do it we must all collaborate. The ninety nations attending this year’s event are all committed to action. Among them are four Australian states – South Australia, Victoria, NSW and Queensland.

Our Aussie states are making a great start and with them some visionary councils. However, the circular economy will not progress if it’s a siloed waste policy – it must be an economic policy attached to productivity and jobs growth.

If Australia is to become a circular superpower, urgent research is required by our federal government working with COAG and state treasuries to value and catalyse this transformation before we are left behind.

Transitioning to a circular economy is inevitable, but winning solutions will not be created using old ways of doing things, they really do require change and harnessing innovation, new businesses and private and public sector collaboration.

Australia cannot grow sustainably by taking the same linear approach to infrastructure, products and services it has taken for the past 75 to 100 years. We need some new solutions ASAP.

53,Recycle solar panels and batteries for a healthier planet: Griffith University report,"Australia needs to recycle solar panels and batteries once they reach retirement age in a clean, sustainable way. This will assist in achieving what researchers term, a “circular economy”.

A report by Griffith University researchers from the Gold Coast campus of the Queenland private university says the nation needs to shift from a linear to a circular supply chain to avoid harming humans and the planet.

The report highlights the problems of, and solutions tom the looming chemical ‘stockpile’ which is set to grow as our solar panels and batteries reach the end of their lives.

The research, by Griffith University’s engineering department, was published earlier this year in the Journal of Cleaner Production.

It says Australia faces large volumes of waste as solar products recycle. This is because, like all electronic products, rooftop PV panels and solar batteries contain potentially toxic materials.

Although these are harmless during the products’ lives, recycling solar panels once the product retires requires special attention.

In fact, Australia will have more than 1,500 kilotonnes of retired solar panel waste by 2050 according to the research.

Solar panels have a lifespan of around 20-25 years. This means the first generation of retired panels is already in the system.

However, retired solar batteries will also become a recycling issue in around six years. For example, the Tesla Powerwall 2 comes with a 10-year warranty, so first generation Powerwalls will start to retire around 2025.

The research shows a sustainable supply chain with smart recycling will reduce harm to humans and the environment. It will also limit mining of scarce natural resources to manufacture solar panels and batteries.

This ‘circular economy’ should include everyone involved in making, selling and buying solar panels and batteries, the researchers claim. It can then:
• Reduce the need for new raw materials
• Use renewable energy throughout the process

Researchers say federal and state environment ministers have already agreed to update the National Waste Policy to include circular economy principles.

Australia has little capacity to deal with solar energy waste at present, the researchers claim. Meanwhile, countries like China are refusing to accept overseas solar waste.

Industry, business and consumers also currently have few incentives to recycle solar panels and other waste products.

However, South Australia and the ACT have banned certain e-waste (electronic waste) categories from landfill. Victoria also says no e-waste can enter landfill from July 1 this year.

Meanwhile, Sustainability Victoria wants solar products to be fully included in the Government’s Product Stewardship Act. Those who make, sell and use solar products would therefore share responsibility for their safe disposal.

129,Incorporating circular economy not as easy as it seems | Food & Beverage,"APCO is what is called a co-regulatory body, whose role it is to administer the Australian Packaging Covenant.

“The Australian Packaging Covenant is a regulatory framework that sits under the National Environmental Protection Measure for used packaging. It is very firmly a co-regulatory body,” said Donnelly at a speech she gave at AUSPACK 2019 in Melbourne. “If you think about product stewardship, there are a couple of ways in which you can do that. You can do it in a voluntary sense, which is the industry getting together and deciding to do something. You can do it in a co-regulatory sense, which is industry and government getting together to do something, or you can do it in a mandatory sense, which is the government telling the industry what to do. We’re in what I like to think is the nice place in the middle, where we’re working together and we’ve got a framework to work to.”

The covenant has been going for 20 years, and every five years a new strategic plan is put in place that is agreed between industry and government together. In 2016, both industry and government got together to begin looking at a new approach. The covenant had been around for quite some time and it was struggling to find a way to deliver effectively to industry and government on the packaging changes that needed to happen. Government and industry looked at what model could be applied – looking particularly at the circular economy.

“We had a mandate in the 2017 strategic plan to deliver the sustainable packaging pathways in Australia through a circular economy model, which is no small feat,” said Donnelly. “It’s wonderful to talk about circular economy conceptually, but it is quite difficult to deliver in an operational sense, because it does require a complete transformation of the entire packaging ecosystem. That requires a level of collaboration and is driven through a collective impact model, which is all about shared value. If one of us doesn’t get there, none of us get there – that means you’ve got to take everybody on that journey with you. When you have 1,500 organisations and eight different governments (including states, territories and federal), that’s quite the challenge. So a co-regulatory body has a big task in terms of bringing stakeholders along the journey and getting everybody to where they need to be to be effective in this space.”

They focussed on four key areas. One is helping with the Sustainable Packaging Guidelines (SPG), which APCO has reviewed, with the end result being a new version of the SPG due out at the end of 2019. They are also at the forefront of providing a prep tool, which is a packaging recyclability portal, that is available to all APCO members, giving them the ability to actually know that they are designing packaging that has the ability to be recycled.

 The second area APCO focussed on helping businesses identify and develop operational systems required for this work. Some of the key resources in this area are about strategic partnerships – bringing together organisations that otherwise would have no alignment with each other, other than that they have a similar end of life material.

“For example, we have 1,500 organisations that represent 153 different ANSZIC codes,” she said. “And if you can end up with an airline, a homewares company, a retailer and a pharmaceutical who, in any other sense, would probably not be having conversations – but who all have a similar material that they may need to deal with at end of life – that gives you the ability, in terms of looking at programs and options going forward, of scaling up material volumes and models that previously may not have been economically or operationally viable. That is because the limited scope of the material available can actually be scaled up on that collective impact model.”

The third area is education. The Australasian Recycling Label is the flagship piece of work for APCO in terms of helping industry and governments to communicate with consumers/communities about packaging and how to deal with packaging at end of life.

 Finally, the fourth area is about material circularity. There’s no point recycling a piece of packaging unless it has a home to go to that has a value, said Donnelly. Material circularity is about dealing with the end market and creating a sustainable ecosystem for post-consumer recyclables.

Donnelly also touched on China’s national sword policy that reduced the amount of impurities it would allow in recycled materials coming from countries like Australia. And this, said Donnelly, is where Australian food, beverage and other industries that rely on packaging need a change in mindset.

China’s new policy saw the value of recycled materials drop through the floor. What this did was highlight the economic impact of the decision within Australia and whether it was palatable to have that level of risk on the global market for a commodity item such as waste.

“After much conversation among industry and government, it became obvious that that level of risk was not palatable,” said Donnelly. “So what’s our alternative? Our alternative is that we must create a domestic market and domestic opportunities for those materials to be used. Here there is a big transformation that’s required. APCO did a report that is available on our website, and that was completed around the time the China national sword policy was announced. That was one of the key things that really drove the need to do something different to what we’ve been doing traditionally. That coupled with the sustainable development goals and consumers’ greater awareness coming from things like ‘The War on Waste’, really drove a need to take a very different approach.”

In April 2018, APCO met with the state and federal environment ministers to discuss how APCO could support the response to these issues. Initially, the organisation went through a series of ways it could do that and it also tried to look how it could reach a target that could enable it to have something for companies to work towards.

“It was at that point that the 100 per cent target with regard to packaging being reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025 was endorsed by every government in Australia, including federal,” said Donnelly. “We then went away and, in coordination with industry and government, we sat down and spent about six months working through what other targets and what other areas needed to be addressed to support such an audacious target. There were a range of targets that were discussed, but the consensus and the agreement in the end was around three other sub-targets that support that 100 per cent target. We talked about 70 per cent of plastic packaging being recycled or composted.”

Another target was 30 per cent average recycled content across all packaging.

“This is very much about driving the pull,” she said. “We need a pull in the market to give a home to these materials, and there’s no home if the home doesn’t have a value. Looking at recycled content is about understanding how we can get recycled content into certain material. And this is not a ‘purist version’ of bottle to bottle, this is about finding a home for materials that can be recycled across a range of activities. This conversation is very open about what the solution can be.

“You’ll note that the target is an average recycled content, and that is because recycled content can’t go into all packaging. There are some things that it can’t go into and that is really challenging – things like pharmaceuticals, some food products – and if you’re looking at a 30 per cent recycled content target, really the focus area is about looking, initially, at your tertiary packaging and your secondary packaging. And primary packaging is something that we can look at, but not where we would be suggesting to start from a strategic viewpoint.”

The final target APCO mentioned was phasing out problematic and unnecessary single-use plastic packaging through re-design, innovation or alternative delivery methods.

“This is a big, contentious area,” said Donnelly. “This is the whole space where people are talking about plastic-free and all these kinds of things. What’s bubbling up from this is a need to recognise that there are some packaging materials where we just shouldn’t use single-use plastics. But here’s the thing – if you’re not going to do that, you need to have a plan on what your alternative is. There’s no point in banning straws or balloons, and that’s what we’ve seen recently. Some councils have come out and banned things like straws and then they’ve had an issue with the disability sector, where some people need straws to consume food. We need to be working through alternative models and planned pathway for transitioning away from these materials.

“It’s not that you shouldn’t transition away from things. There are going to be some materials that are just simply too hard to recover, or not recoverable, which we can use alternative materials for, but we need to do the work and planning for what those things will be, and for that transition pathway.

“You’ll see some news pieces around people and certain industry sectors pushing back and saying we should mandate recycled content. Well, we’ve got to agree on what recycled content is first. In this space right now, we are in a very big transition and it’s a transition that needs to be done in a considered way. It is about making sure that we have the best possible outputs and outcomes in a considered way so that we don’t drive perverse outcomes.”",Australia,2019.06

264,How Your Old Jeans Could Become Someone's Prosthetic Knee,"Your jeans could be re-purposed and sold as part of someone's prosthetic knee.

An Australian designed solution to textile waste means old clothing can be converted into almost anything -- and engineers are getting closer to getting it on shop shelves.

It's a bid to help reduce the growing amount of fast-fashion waste.

The fast-fashion industry contributed to an increase in the amount of textile waste going to landfill. In fact, 500,000 tonnes of waste from the textile industry goes to landfill each year.

A whopping 20 percent of all freshwater pollution is a result of textile treatment and dying. Dying is also a resource-heavy process that uses a plethora of human and natural resources.

But technology developed by Australia's own Institute Frontier Materials at Deakin University has developed a way to repurpose natural, dyed or blended fibres into anything, even a prosthetic knee.

The process sees fabrics broken down to their basic chemical form.

""We started with denim, it's a common fashion item, everyone can relate to it and it's easy to explain,"" Dr Nolene Byrne Associate Professor from Deakin's leading circular economy group, Institute for Technology Research and Innovation told 10 daily.

Researchers access the cellulose bio-polymer -- an abundant, versatile and strong carbohydrate that comes predominantly from trees and has many industrial uses. Cellulose is used to make everything from paper to cellophane, industrial gels, and acetates.

Cotton is also 90 percent cellulose. This is significant because an old cotton garment, like a t-shirt or a pair of jeans, could be recycled to make an entirely new object.

""There is a pulping process, where you remove the ligaments and other components from trees and what you are left with is wood pulp and a high purity cellulose material.

""You can make many products from wood pulp from recycled products so that's where are we going with the synthetic knees,"" she said.

While the cotton recycling process is the closest to being adopted by the industry, similar processes for blended and synthetic textiles are also being developed.

The Institute's system means textile colours and dyes can be reused, making the new process significantly more environmentally friendly than what currently exists.

""When we look at places recycling, there are ways to recycle plastics. The amount of [textile] waste that is generated and continues to be generated on the scale that it is with the population growth, there has to be chemical textile recycling,"" Byrne said.

Bryne also said the new research essentially provides a circular economy-style option for the textile industry, where clothing items can be recreated and repurposed instead of going to landfill.

READ MORE: I Had The Bottle To Go Without Plastic For A Week. Here's What Happened.

""We wanted our technology to be a closed loop and we wanted the solvent system, or the chemicals, to be eco-friendly and sustainable ... as well as economical as possible,"" Byrne said.

A circular economy is much more than traditional recycling.

It's an alternative to the current 'take, make, throwaway' approach to products. It tries to refocus consumer and manufacturer thinking to a 'take, make and recreate' system.

""One of the main principles is trying to get rid of the concept of waste because if you think about it, what is waste?"" Research Director at the Centre for Business and Social Innovation at the University Of Technology, Sydney Melissa Edwards told 10 daily.

""Waste is just something that we have decided is a resource that doesn't have value anymore but actually, all resources and all materials have value it's just about how we use them.""

But if those items are to keep their value, they have to be kept in use for longer. Byrne's research is an example of this, where a used item of fabric is repurposed into another garment or a completely different object, thus giving it further value.

Edwards said both consumers and manufacturers don't have to ""give up everything"" they are used to, but change their mindset about how items are made and disposed of.

""We want disposability, people want convenience ... and that helps us think differently about product design,"" she said.

""If I have a completely biodegradable package that goes back into the earth and enhances the soil ... and if that package has been produced using renewable energy sources does it matter if am consuming that and then disposing it?""",Australia,2019.06
276,Bold ideas to transform New Zealand,"Stuff asked: What are the biggest, boldest ideas to transform New Zealand?

With our rich natural, cultural and intellectual capital New Zealand could make some truly bold changes, and perhaps lead the world by example – if we dare.

Stuff asked a range of Kiwi businesspeople, thought leaders and cultural ambassadors what their one big idea would be to transform New Zealand.

High on the agenda for many was increasing protections for the environment and moving to a more sustainable, green, economy.

Others want to shake up our electoral system, invest in technology and education and grow capital markets to take the country forward.

I want to give natural sites personhood. Why? We already give legal personhood to corporates, and they aren't even alive.

Nature is declining at rates unprecedented in human history. Several iwi have had their natural sites of significance recognised as living beings, with the legal rights of personhood as a way to protect them and recognise the deep and intergenerational connection they have.

My idea for transformation is to provide quality professional development to all teachers across all levels.

From 2020, all schools across New Zealand will adopt the new digital technologies curriculum. This significant move is a response to our society entering a digital era, where digital skills – development of technology or computational thinking – are as necessary as reading, writing, and numeracy.

We need to build on New Zealand's outstanding pool of internationally recognised artificial intelligence (AI) expertise by training, attracting and retaining more top researchers who want to lead the world in machine learning and deep learning research. This could involve creating a not-for-profit institute dedicated to research in the field of AI, excelling in machine and deep learning.

When the experience of mainstream fashion is made accessible, we can transform New Zealand.

Fashion is the nucleus of cultural relevance, it speaks to self-agency and confidence.

By reflecting and empowering people with disabilities in mainstream fashion we can spark wider change. Through design we can build a barrier-free society.

We need to get tough about cleaning up the environment. We should implement a user pays system for visiting New Zealand, and with the money, give a better experience.

Install more public toilets and maintain them well, and manage rubbish disposal better. Impose steep fines for breaches: $20,000 for soiling, $5000 for littering, and set up a website for reporting.

Fine companies renting campervans without toilets, and those that give discounts for toilets returned unused. Issue permits for a fee to 'freedom camp'. No permit; automatic $1000 fine.

If we are to make the waka go faster we need to invest heavily in infrastructure right now – even if the cost is high.

Work on an alternative harbour crossing in Auckland, high-speed rail to Hamilton and a four-lane highway to Whangarei would all allow investment to pour in and productivity to rise.

My big idea is to change the distribution of power to 75 electorates made up of 25 children's, 25 Māori, and 25 general electorate seats, and 45 list seats.

Enfranchising children and empowering Māori will shock the entrenched power structures that perpetuate the business-as-usual status quo. This upheaval in the balance of power is needed to transform decision-making processes to longer-term perspectives.

New Zealand needs to dramatically increase our population of experts.

Through opening our border to engineers, scientists, technologists, investors and researchers, we will generate friction, debate and new capability, encouraging higher levels of innovation.

In turn, we can become a world leader in contemporary industries supporting a dynamic and evolving economy.

Our current model of agriculture is a battle to control nature.

Foundational advances in microbiology and plant physiology have occurred since the 1980's, but has yet to be applied to food production.

The new understanding is of a complex, cooperative natural system that relies on microbial diversity. By tweaking our fertilisation, planting and grazing practices, we can quickly achieve massive environmental health benefits.

Tahlia and Semisi Hutchison, founders of Little and Brave Eco Nappies

Make landfills a thing of the past. Significantly reducing landfills will kick-start innovation across a range of industries from product and packaging design, to resource and waste management, to home, community and commercial composting.

With strategic legislation, infrastructure investment, and incentives for innovators, we can build the public-private partnerships needed to create a circular economy for our country.

New Zealand needs to get closer to China. Sometime soon, China will have the biggest economy the world has seen. If we're to be anything other than a bit player in a China-led economy, we need to grow our existing cultural, economic and political ties, fast.

We're not starting from scratch: our history with China goes back to the 1800s, 150 years on, it's time to give back.

China is filled with optimistic people hungry for a better future.

We must lift the capability of all New Zealanders, especially those who are struggling. If we, through government agencies, keep developing programmes the way we have always done we are going to keep getting the results we've always got.

Communities need to be engaged with, and deeply involved in, the design and implementation of the solutions to poor health care and poor housing situations. We need to support what's already working at the grassroots level.

For example, programmes like Kootuitui Ki Papakura – education, health services, warm, dry, healthy homes.

Jeremy Moon, founder of Icebreaker Clothing, chairman of Better by Design and business mentor

The minimum wage has increased to a fair level, the focus should now be on increasing the average wage. One way to achieve this is to create more high value jobs, through creating more international businesses from New Zealand.

It's not just about kiwis selling more stuff to each other – it's about New Zealanders running businesses that extend the borders of our economy internationally.

They should be encouraged with more support and funding, and ultimately be celebrated for their courageous journeys into the unknown.

Aotearoa New Zealand should convert all its dairy, sheep, beef and horticulture to a regenerative form of agriculture that restores and enhances the mauri of the land, rivers, air, kai and improves sequestration of carbon, resilience and profitability.

Pine forests and other retired farming lands could be converted to permanent and harvestable native forests increasing the value of our eco-tourism industry providing meaningful work, as every tree planted helps save many threatened taonga species of birds, insects and plants.

My big idea is to change to accounting and tax law, requiring environmental costs to be accounted for and paid into direct environmental taxes.

Putting the cost of pollution inside the cost of production makes the cost of pollution inherent in the cost of the product. This change of thinking can apply to all products, not just of agricultural production but for petrol, plastics, packaging, tobacco and alcohol.

The retailer or the processing facility can choose to buy the cheapest products however that would come with fees allocated to be paid into environmental funds. So if a company used environmentally friendly ingredients or materials, these fees would not be paid.

Nothing like fees and responsibility at the board table to encourage change.

Start acknowledging the importance of vulnerability as a leadership capability to create business growth through culture change.

Vulnerability is described by Brené Brown as being the ""core, the heart, the centre of meaningful human experiences,"" so it's about time the era of 'hardening up' in the workplace and leaving your 'baggage' at the door comes to an end.

If Kiwi leaders stood up, embraced vulnerability and focused more on creating business cultures steeped in wellbeing and belonging, I think we would see a very different environment to what we have now.

Taste is never corrupted by simplicity. Regenerative farmers focusing on soil health and function are demonstrating pathways to reduce irrigation, synthetic chemicals, and antibiotics by tapping into ecological processes.

For them it's intuitively better because it's simpler. Globally farmers using these techniques create healthier landscapes, grow produce with few toxic residues, lift profits, improve farmer mental health, generate better marketing stories, and store carbon in soil.

Allbirds announced that its entire business, end-to-end, is going carbon neutral beginning this year.

Climate change, and by association sustainability, is the problem of our generation and solving it is not just the right thing to do, it is good business.

It seems clear to me that the nations preparing to transform to inclusive green economies will be the winners over time. Based as I am now in the United Sates, in a country that hasn't yet reached consensus on the problem itself, I don't think we should underestimate the opportunity this represents.

Imagine a future where you pay only for the use of the goods you need, and manufacturers retain ownership of the raw materials.

Globally, consumers spend US$40 trillion (NZ$61t) a year. What do we have to show for it? Homes stuffed with raw materials – plastics, metals, paper, textiles – that we no longer use and don't know what to do with.

Brands shift to selling services, not goods, and designers design for quality, disassembly and repairabilty.

Let's fund 10 new venture capital funds with at least $100 million each. Let's have all the Kiwisaver funds and the Super Fund allocate 4 per cent to growing companies in New Zealand.

Let's stir up the stockbrokers to get to know the new companies and find the good ones for us. Let's tell the brokers that we want to invest in the Rocketlabs and Lanzatechs being built – making us proud owners of the great new companies being built from New Zealand.",New Zealand,2019.06
288,Coca-Cola NZ setting recycling standard - Food & Drink Business,"Coca-Cola Oceania and Coca-Cola Amatil have announced all plastic bottles smaller than one litre made in New Zealand will be made entirely from recycled plastic by the end of this year.

This includes all packaging smaller than 1 litre for brands like Coca-Cola, Sprite, Powerade, Fanta and L&P, as well as Kiwi Blue and Pump water across all pack sizes.

The announcement makes New Zealand one of the first countries in the world to achieve and exceed Coca-Cola’s global sustainable packaging goal to increase its use of recycled plastic.

Coca-Cola Oceania GM, Richard Schlasberg, said: “As one of New Zealand’s largest beverage companies, we have a responsibility to be part of the solution to the plastic waste crisis.

Coca-Cola Amatil New Zealand MD, Chris Litchfield, said: “Our move to substantially increase the use of recycled plastic means we will avoid using around 2900 tonnes of new plastic and that’s incredibly positive for our environment. Already all the bottles and cans we make can be recycled, and this takes it a step further towards creating a truly circular economy.”

331,Gisborne CEOs join climate change fight,"Two of Gisborne’s biggest organisations have committed to tackling the “climate crisis” by reducing greenhouse gas emissions through the Climate Leaders Coalition.

Established in July 2018, the coalition (CLC) includes some of New Zealand’s largest businesses, which collectively account for 60 percent of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions.

By signing up to the CLC, signatories commit to measuring their greenhouse gas emissions, publicly reporting on these and setting a public emissions reduction target.

To date, 108 chief executives have signed the CLC joint statement, which also includes a commitment to the Paris Agreement (see story above right).

ECT chief executive Gavin Murphy and his Eastland Group counterpart Matt Todd are the most recent to join the CLC roster.

In a joint statement, they agreed with coalition members to further reduce the original agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions — in line with what’s needed to limit warming — from 2 to 1.5 degrees.

Mr Murphy said ensuring a safe and prosperous future for the region went hand-in-hand with looking after the land, oceans and waterways.

“We are committed to creating a Tairawhiti where everyone thrives. To do this, ensuring we align with global directives to combat climate change is a must.”

ECT had already taken steps to align with the CLC joint statement, he said.

The majority of its vehicle fleet was electric and through the trust’s economic development arm — Activate Tairawhiti — it was exploring how to best support local businesses to transition to a circular economy model, by default, a low emissions economy.

Activate Tairawhiti economic development general manager Steve Breen said its Gisborne Circular Economy Conference in May was a great starting point.

“Alongside local leadership, the conference brought national and global sustainability leadership and thinking to the region.

“We have 12 years to turn greenhouse gas emissions around to limit global warming to the Paris Agreement target of 1.5 degrees.

“In in our view, the conference has helped kick-start regional efforts to assist local businesses in reducing their carbon emissions.”

It also showed businesses the value in doing so “not just for the planet, but for employees, the community and for their bottom line”.

Mr Murphy said ECT’s continued support of Tairawhiti Environment Centre umbrella projects, as well as a $231,363 distribution this month to Gizzy Kai Rescue, represented a conscious effort to make distribution decisions for the benefit of community and environmental wellbeing, said Mr Murphy.

Locally, green waste made up 26 percent of the material entering landfills, he said.

Since October, Gizzy Kai Rescue rescued and redistributed 26 tonnes of surplus food and non-food items to community groups — a notable contribution to the region’s 2024 long-term plan to reduce green waste by 40 percent.

Mr Murphy urged the community to look out for the trust’s upcoming Have Your Say campaign.

Have Your Say comes on the back of the trust’s Tu Ora Ai Tatou — Living Well Together report, which is aimed at developing a regional wellbeing framework and distribution measurement tool.

“If you want to see the environment as a focal point for distributions funding, then make sure you take part in Have Your Say in the coming months.”

As part of joining the Climate Leaders Coalition, ECT and Eastland Group have partnered to employ a specialist in measuring and reducing emissions.

“Together with our shareholder Eastland Community Trust, we champion a variety of environmentally-focused projects that support sustainability within the Tairawhiti Gisborne region,” Mr Todd said.

As part of the focus on sustainable and renewable energy, 90 percent of Eastland Group’s non-commercial fleet was electric, he said.

Funding from the Energy Efficiency and Conversion Authority’s Low Emission Vehicles Contestable Fund and ECT also allowed Eastland Group to install six EV fast chargers throughout the region and to set up the Electric Village energy hub.

Mr Todd said each sector — Eastland Port, Gisborne Airport and Eastland Generation — were looking at innovative ways to reduce the group’s overall carbon footprint.

“We believe we can be a leader in steering Tairawhiti towards zero carbon through renewable energy and facilitating the transition to electric vehicles.”

Mr Todd said the CLC provided a unique opportunity for businesses to work together and learn from each other to reduce emissions.

The coalition celebrated its one-year anniversary this week with the EMBARK Achieving Low Emissions Together event in Auckland. Jarred Moroney attended on behalf of Eastland Group and ECT.

332,Rising tide of plastic choking Port Phillip Bay,"The EcoCentre has been analysing tens of thousands of litter items gathered in the collections from both waterways. Hard plastics were the most common items found in both rivers, followed by polystyrene in the Yarra and soft plastics in the Maribyrnong River. Summer was the peak litter season for the Maribyrnong whereas it was both summer and winter for the Yarra. The estimated quantity of rubbish has increased markedly since The Age reported the first release of statistics from the research a year ago, which showed more than 800 million pieces of trash were flowing into Port Phillip Bay from the two rivers.

Port Phillip EcoCentre marine biologist Fam Charko said protecting the bay was a responsibility shared by all Victorians. “Port Phillip Bay is not like the ocean. It's a fairly enclosed marine ecosystem in the sense that it doesn't get plastic pollution from Asia or anywhere else in the world,” she said. The litter we find on bay beaches is ours and ours alone. It got there from the suburbs. “The litter we find on bay beaches is ours and ours alone. It got there from the suburbs, via the waterways and is not likely to float away elsewhere on the next tide.” But she was encouraged that the figures showed a reduction in the number of straws in the Yarra River, which was the only litter category to decline.

“That’s a nice surprise,” she said. “The community and businesses have been working really hard all over Victoria to reduce plastic straws.” Plastic straws are among the most common items found washed up on beaches around the world, according to Sustainability Victoria. A litter trap in the Yarra River near Webb Bridge. But consumers and businesses have embraced alternatives to plastic straws, including glass, metal and paper. The EcoCentre conducted monthly top water trawls lasting 30 minutes in locations close to the bay, analysing more than 20,000 pieces of litter in total.

The EcoCentre’s Clean Bay Blueprint research project received funding from the Victorian government’s Port Phillip Bay Fund and the statistics were overseen by academics from Monash University. The EcoCentre hopes its study will lead to strong action as the Andrews government prepares a new marine policy and a plan for a “circular economy” designed to reduce waste and better use natural resources. Port Phillip EcoCentre executive officer April Seymore called for a “radical rethink” in the way we use plastics. She said everyone played a role in reducing plastic use, from product designers to politicians. “Let’s make the story we see with straws the story of all plastic products,” she said.

Mornington Peninsula anti-litter campaigner Josie Jones says a local push to eradicate plastic straws had been paying off. But Ms Jones, who is a keen underwater photographer, said she often saw the devastating effect of rubbish on local wildlife. She recently found a penguin on Dromana beach tangled in balloons. And plastic bags were potentially deadly for local seahorses, she said. “One plastic bag in a marine environment can suffocate a whole colony,” she said.

The Andrews government has moved to ban single-use plastic bags in shops and supermarkets across Victoria. The ban covers all light-weight single-use carry bags, including those made from degradable, biodegradable and compostable plastics. However, plastic bin liners, small clear plastic bags used for fresh fruit and vegetables and animal waste bags will be exempt from the ban. A spokeswoman for the Victorian government said it was working to protect the “treasured” Port Phillip Bay through a dedicated fund and management plan. “Port Phillip Bay is one of Victoria’s most precious natural assets and we’re partnering with community organisations to improve its health,” she said.

The animal’s death prompted calls from the Department of Environment and Zoos Victoria for people to dispose of their rubbish properly.",Australia,2019.07
366,WA councils doing it for themselves on waste,"A group of 13 councils in Western Australia’s south west have joined forces to accelerate their transitions to a circular economy.

The group is asking companies in local, national and international markets to come up with ways to use waste that will benefit the region.

According to Nick Edwards from the City of Busselton, who is the project officer responsible for the South West Regional Waste Group.

It’s an informal move that will put the councils ahead of the game in the transition to a circular economy.

The idea is to explore the growing array of new and emerging technologies that can potentially turn waste into valuable by-products and reduce the volume of waste to landfill at the same time.

He told The Fifth Estate the “time is right”.

There’s also been a high level of public enthusiasm to get involved and find solutions to waste problems.

“The ABC’s War on Waste… it comes up time and time again. It’s often on the tips of people’s tongues, it’s like a touchstone for these types of conversations.

“The work they’ve done is profound. People are informed, people are starting to follow the supply chain of their products…”

He says community interest is influencing the project but it’s not the only driver. “There’s also council economics to consider.”

Edwards’ group is not the only local governments exploring waste alternatives. NSW’s Tenterfield Shire Council is working with Moree Plains Shire Council, the NSW Country Mayors Association and Regional Development Australia – Northern Inland to explore a waste to energy plant.

But as far as Edwards understands, his group of councils is the only one in the country banding together to explore waste alternatives in such a non-prescriptive manner.

He says it’s not unusual for Western Australian councils to collaborate where it makes sense to do so. Working together means leveraging economies of scale, which opens doors for smaller councils that would otherwise struggle to instigate change.

Waste to energy is one technology that’s attracting attention as one component of the solution further down the waste hierarchy, with a number of proposed projects in Australia. WA’s Kwinana, 40 kilometres south of Perth, will soon be home to the first major waste to energy facility in Australia.

But the WA councils are doing their best to keep an open mind to all options.

For example, one option is for one operator to service all councils from a central plant and facility. Or smaller processing spots for each council, depending on how the economics stack up.

“We’re interested in looking outside the normal disposal methods because there’s all sorts of risks associated with landfill.”

Reforming waste management is currently a priority in the state. The state government released the Waste Avoidance and Resource Recovery Strategy 2030 earlier in the year, which has “given [local governments] a direction to run in”.

“We are different to a lot of places in terms of distance and travelling times and population, all that means is we need to be creative.

“It’s going to be a challenge, but the solution will most likely be long term.”

The urgency to reform waste management practises is ramping up in some of the metropolitan areas because landfill space is running low.

401,Companies coming around to plastic reuse,"Brent Balinski speaks to Harry Wang, founder of Advanced Circular Polymers, about the company’s factory and serving manufacturers wanting to adopt recycled plastics in their products.

From kicks to shampoo bottles and beyond, there are signs that businesses are starting to commit to the use of recycled materials.

Adidas has a goal of selling 11 million pairs of shoes containing recycled plastics this year. Its head of global brands told Financial Times last year, “Our goal is to get rid of virgin polyester overall by 2024.” Adidas says polyester makes up roughly half of the material it sells.

In 2017 Procter & Gamble introduced a limited edition Head & Shoulders bottle in France, using 25 per cent recycled plastic collected from European beaches. It plans to halve use of virgin petroleum plastics by 2030 through a range of means, including the use of recycled material.

The extraordinary usefulness of plastics is well-understood. Look at your phone or computer now and you will likely see plastic. Look up and the same thing is true. However, there is an increased appreciation from businesses and consumers that plastics don’t break down very easily when discarded, and that the amount of rubbish in landfills and waterways is growing. If one famous prediction from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation is to be believed, at this rate there will be more plastics than fish (by weight) in waterways by 2050.

Harry Wang, founder of Somerton, Victoria’s Advanced Circular Polymers, believes that we should be treating plastics like gold. Yes, they are useful, but they can be useful again after a product’s life cycle has concluded.

He tells us that China’s clampdown on imported waste – which some put down to the 2016 documentary Plastic China – inspired him to start his recycling business. He formed his company in late-2016 and, after dry production runs in May, its factory had its official opening late-last month.

“I recognised this opportunity when China stopped taking waste from other places; so we need a solution in Australia to solve the problem,” Wang tells @AuManufacturing.

The company’s $20 million investment includes in artificial intelligence and robotics, able to discern between and sort the seven different families of plastic. Wang says such sorting technology has progressed significantly in the last two years and is currently quite mature. Equipment was imported from the US, commissioning took six months, and most of the work was in designing the best layout and process flows.

He adds that most of the MRF (material recovery facility) consultants in Australia seemed to specialise in glass recycling.

“I couldn’t get exactly the experience [needed] for the plastic processing,” says Wang.

The site’s commissioning was assisted by a $500,000 grant from the Victorian government’s Resource Recovery Infrastructure Fund. It has an annual capacity of 70,000 tonnes per year, currently employs 53, and has three products. These are hot washed flakes of PET, natural HDPE, and coloured HDPE. It sources recyclables from local MRFs for treatment.

Wang estimates that 60 per cent of sales have been from within Victoria and 30 per cent from NSW so far. The goal is to also export to developed countries where companies are demanding high-quality recycled plastic sources, particularly food grade. He says ACP’s prices work out around 60 per cent higher than for virgin polymers.

“The competitive advantage is not in price, but the way a lot of big brands all want to be involved in getting much more recycled content in their containers,” he explains.

“For some of them, they want to achieve 100 per cent recycled plastic materials… The customer is not buying our product because it’s cheaper than virgin material.”

Australia has not led the circular economy trend globally, but there are signs it is beginning to take note. Among these are a NSW Circular Economy Innovation Network, announced in February, and $20 million for Cooperative Research Centre projects concerned with plastic recycling and waste-reduction announced by the Coalition during the federal election campaign.

With more countries – such as Indonesia – sending back contaminated Australian waste bales or just ending waste plastic imports altogether, there is more pressure to give discarded materials a second life.

Wang and others believe that we should focus on solving our own problems, rather than shipping them overseas for somebody else to take care of, and that responsibility is with both the government and the governed.

“This falls to the public sector – people need to recognise this, and also the government need to put more regulations around just to make sure all the people in the industry do the right thing,” he offers.

“A lot of education to the general public is also needed because the most important difficulty we’re getting here is in the mix of plastic bales we see a lot of general waste and things that shouldn’t be in that.”

Along the way there are opportunities for companies who have – like Adidas, Procter & Gamble, Advanced Circular Polymers and others – seen that customers’ demands are changing, and that it’s possible to grow businesses while shrinking their contribution to landfills.

429,The circular economy startup saving SMEs thousands in landfill costs,"An Aussie startup helping small businesses with lowering their waste costs is calling on Australian governments to support efforts to get firms involved in the circular economy.

ASPIRE is an online marketplace which matches businesses with remanufacturers, purchasers and recyclers of waste materials. The idea is to provide businesses with a cheaper and more sustainable option than landfill for their waste.

Originally developed in 2015 by researchers from CSIRO, the startup this week transitioned out of its Data61 innovation group and became its own independent company, led by chief executive Cameron McKenzie.

While ASPIRE works with businesses, local governments are actually its customers, meaning businesses based in areas where councils have paid for the service can use it free of charge.

Already operational across 16 council jurisdictions across the country, about 300 businesses have already used the platform to circulate everything from batteries, organics and timber pallets to new homes.

McKenzie tells SmartCompany the venture has so far saved companies an estimated $200,000 in costs associated with waste removal, while also saving 45,000 tonnes of rubbish from landfill.

“Businesses are increasingly seeing their cost of doing business go up and up ⁠— the cost of landfill has tripled,” McKenzie says.

ASPIRE uses digital tools to “intelligently match” businesses with others who could reuse their waste. Dubbed a “social business network” it actively identifies and suggests opportunities for businesses to collaborate with each other.

Every year 67 million tonnes of waste is generated in Australia, and as countries across the world introduce new waste import restrictions, the cost of disposing of rubbish has skyrocketed.

As much as 80% of Australia’s waste bill is generated through commercial activities, including construction and demolition, meaning small-to-medium businesses are a vital part of any effort to reduce local landfill.

A 2018 study looking at Australia’s waste policy predicted a 5% improvement in the “efficient use of materials” across the economy could increase economic output by up to $24 billion each year.

Swinburne’s startup accelerator program is already supporting ASPIRE alongside CSIRO’s ON accelerator program, but McKenzie says he’d like to see government at the local, state and federal levels do more to support sustainable waste practices.

“We need behavioural change. You really need to help these businesses with their bottom lines and sustainability,” McKenzie says.

ASPIRE’s next focus will be pitching to state governments, with the hope support at this level will turbocharge its efforts to scale the platform, enabling more companies to take advantage of the circular economy.

“If we got federal support, that would be huge,” he says.

438,Match-making marketplace for the circular economy to go national,"There’s a new match-making service that started in Victoria that pairs up waste generators with remanufacturers, purchasers or recyclers that can repurpose the waste, and it’s got national ambitions.

Developed by the CSIRO through a pilot program, the ASPIRE (Advisory System for Processing, Innovation & Resource Exchange) online marketplace is now commercially available.

The plan is to now expand nationally and get more councils and businesses on board.

Newly appointed chief executive officer Cameron McKenzie says the project started out in Kingston in Victoria where a woman was informally matching waste generators with waste repurposers. The council teamed up with a few others to engage the CSIRO to build a more formal matchmaking network.

The intelligent online platform has since seen four or five years of business development before McKenzie was appointed CEO seven months ago to take the business to a broader audience.

MacKenzie says that because the cost of sending resources to waste and landfill has tripled in the last two to three years, waste disposal has become a huge burden for SMEs and manufacturing companies in some areas.

He says that in the waste-intensive construction industry, the tier ones and twos are “pretty good with sustainability and waste.” But for smaller businesses, “time is money”, and they struggle to find time to separate waste streams and manage their waste responsibly.

The online platform is a tool to help them improve their bottom line and make them more aware of efficient business practices, MacKenzie says.

Through the pilot program 300 businesses are already using ASPIRE, which has collectively saved $207,000 in waste disposal and material costs.

So far it’s matched up a business that found itself swimming in Styrofoam and cardboard from importing electric equipment with a business that mixes Styrofoam with concrete to make a construction material (both light and thermally efficient, MacKenzie says).

Another match has allowed a social enterprise that employs disadvantaged Australians to save enough to pay for wages for one and half employees.

The tool will also play a role in proving compliance with upcoming circular economy policies, according to MacKenzie, which are expected for release soon in NSW and Victoria. Queensland released a strategy on waste management and the circular economy earlier this month.

Data will be able to be extracted from the platform to show that businesses are active members and working towards closing the circle on resource recovery.

The business model will encourage more councils to get on board

The startup currently relies on council subscriptions. Once a council is subscribed, businesses in that location can use the service for free. Businesses outside participating jurisdictions can also join, but also pay a fee.

This model will help grow the tool as businesses with big waste expenses will hopefully start putting pressure on councils to adopt it so that they can start saving money.

He says there’s been interest already from Sydney councils, which will get the tool up and running in NSW. It’s also had a lot interest from south-east Queensland and Adelaide.",Australia,2019.07

Leela Dilkes-Hoffman, a member of the University of Queensland’s Translational Polymer Research Group, is studying new forms of biodegradable plastics in a bid to counter plastic pollution.

She traces her passion for environmental sustainability back to her upbringing in the bushland of Western Australia.

“I grew up in Margaret River, which is a beautiful part of Western Australia, and I guess there I was a bit sheltered from the amount of waste that we produce in society and where that all needs to go,” Ms Dilkes-Hoffman said.",Australia,2019.07
501,A promising path to improve sustainability of water treatment systems,"The lack of adequate and safe water is one of the major development challenges of our time. Water is central to life and is becoming dangerously scarce and unsafe globally over the coming decades. Population growth, changing consumption patterns, increasing water demand for agriculture, and climate change, are threatening fresh water supplies. A major problem is deterioration of ground water quality due to rising sea-water levels associated with climate change and over-exploitation, resulting in water salinity for many coastal and riverine settings. Surface water contamination with micro pollutants is an emerging issue globally, due to municipal, industrial and agriculture waste water.

This challenging situation is reflected in the lack of progress towards the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 on ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation, specifically 6.1 related to universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030. The latest review report has shown that the world is not on track, with over 2.8 billion people still not having access to safe drinking water. The consequences are dire for those affected; the WHO estimates that contaminated drinking water cause 500,000 diarrheal deaths each year. While, a recent study has shown that drinking saline water is associated with elevated blood pressure, with adverse effects for women during pregnancy on maternal and fetal outcomes.

The alarming increase in scarcity of water across the world has led to an exponential growth in water desalination from unconventional sources, including sea and brackish water. Globally, the majority of desalination systems are using reverse osmosis (RO) due to its excellent performance in impurity removal. The rapid progress in membrane technology and treatment processes, over the past two decades, has made them more , helping to meet some of the increased demand for water in Australia and internationally. There are currently over 20,000 desalination plants operating in 120 countries across the Middle East, North Africa, Australia, China and India among others. However, these systems are capital intensive, and require high-energy inputs and specialized maintenance procedures, to function sustainably. Plus, there are concerns with environmental impact of brine discharge particularly from seawater desalination.

Future growth in desalination and water purification is most likely to rely on the use of brackish water, which has far lower concentration of solids than seawater, and involves cheaper process. Wastewater reuse for a circular economy is another potential solution. Water Innovation and Research Center (WIRC) is leading an extensive and large-scale demonstration of next generation water systems and services across ten sites for the developed and emerging economies. The study is examining effectiveness of innovative technologies to reuse waste water, recover important resources at low cost, and regulatory and policy frameworks that impact circular water systems.

Simultaneously, development and production of small-scale desalination and water purification technologies targeted to the developing context, have steadily increased over the past decade. The Oxfam road-map for small-scale desalination, based on an overview of existing and emerging technologies in South Asia, provided the key considerations for these systems in terms of minimum production capacity from brackish water source, low initial cost, low energy consumption, low maintenance cost, and scalability within existing market systems. The study found that small-scale reverse osmosis (RO) using renewable energy source is among the most effective technologies, with demonstrated technical and economic feasibility in the Sambhar Salt lake region of Rajasthan, India. The study identified the emerging technology, Capacitive Deionization (CDI) that has higher water recovery and lower energy consumption than RO in Madras, India. This CDI model utilizes direct current generated by an off-grid solar panel to separate soluble ions from water under electric field, and consumes much less energy than pushing water through a membrane in RO systems. The WIRC is developing an affordable water purification system using CDI for East African communities to remove excessive fluoride in water, to address significant health problems, such as crippling bone disease.

The main producers of these micro-desalination and water purification technologies are not-for-profit, commercial and private desalination companies that partner with universities, philanthropists, governments, non-governmental organisations, and international development organisations. The water production capacity of small-scale water purification units vary from 20 to a few thousand litres per day. Various water sources can be treated by these purification units, including brackish water with salt content in the range of 1,000-35,000 parts per million, sea water, contaminated water, lakes and rivers. Most of these systems are within 200kg and can easily be assembled and transported with a hand trolley, which makes them suitable for remote areas. A few have already been trialled and used in small communities. For instance, the solar-driven Low Pressure Reverse Osmosis (LPRO) developed by Moerk Water has serviced thousands of people in Kenya, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Island, Somalia, Tanzania, Vanuatu and Australia. Barefoot College, a voluntary organization, has installed six solar-powered desalination plants in India and supported approximately 1,000 people. Swiss Fresh Water started a pilot project in Senegal in 2011 and since then has kept installing purification machine for private and community markets. Plimmer is being marketed by Idropan Australia, and can produce fresh water up to 2000 litres/day with saline water up to 1250 parts per million. Other producers such as Trunz Water system, Boreal Light GmbH, Water Source Australia, Aquvio, Tata projects, Innovative Deionization, Aqua EWP, among others, are rapidly growing and serving hundreds and thousands of people.

Several of the ongoing initiatives are using market-based approaches with encouraging results. For instance, a recent study on the use of water kiosks in Athi River and Rongai, Kenya to increase access to safe and affordable drinking water has shown improvements in living standards, health and income. However, considerable research needs to be conducted to demonstrate replicability at scale. When combined with specific actions to strengthen national policies, regulatory frameworks, governance mechanisms, these initiatives are more likely to be effectively scaled up and sustained. As the Oxfam road map highlights, beyond the technology itself, the key elements of success include enabling environment to support maintenance, supply of consumables, appropriate disposal, and sufficient cost recovery systems.",Australia,2019.07
508,Motorola bucks the trend – it wants repairable smartphones,"Motorola is a smartphone vendor that is actively trying to break the upgrade cycle. While that may seem a contradiction to the mantra to sell more, Motorola says its more concerned about customer satisfaction and long-term loyalty.

GadgetGuy reported last October that Motorola (a Lenovo company) had thrown its considerable bulk behind the ‘Right to Repair’ movement by pledging to supply iFixit with genuine OEM parts and the technology to make repairs to its phones.

Motorola is the only smartphone maker to join the movement!

iFixit says the smartphone industry is undergoing a major quantum shift – people are now holding onto a smartphone for 2.83 years, up from 2.3 years two years earlier.

Now, Motorola has expanded this program to Europe to provide a better service experience to its customers across all 28 EU countries, as well as Norway and Switzerland.

While consumers will still have the option to mail in their broken devices to Motorola’s repair centres, they can now find everything they need for a DIY fix in iFixit’s online store for Europe: high quality OEM parts, dedicated iFixit tools with a lifetime warranty, and a free step-by-step repair guide on iFixit.com, available in several languages.

Right to Repair – it is vital

First, it is about smartphone makers freely providing parts and diagnostic software or codes to legitimate repairers.

Second, it is about convenience. No matter where you are, you can select a repairer at a price and location that suits you.

Third, it is about extending the life of a perfectly adequate smartphone beyond the manufacturers planned obsolescence via battery replacement, replacing parts that tend to break (like micro-USB ports) and screens.

“Manufacturers are an important cog in the circular economy wheel, and this program helps to remove some of the longstanding barriers between manufacturers and independent repair. Providing consumers with spare parts and tools to repair their devices is one of the most significant steps a company can take to reduce the environmental impact of electronics production.”

About a quarter of local councils already recycle food waste but a paper released by the state government proposes a major expansion of the service.

686,Economic downturn,"Ratepayers will back a grassroots project to support the local “circular economy”, co-ordinated by Transition Margaret River.

The Shire of Augusta-Margaret River allocated $9170 to the Make It Local campaign last month, with the program expected to ramp up next year.

The Margaret River Chamber of Commerce, Margaret River Regional Environment Centre, the Organic Garden, and Witchcliffe Ecovillage were among those set to get involved, Transition’s Karen Majer said. “We want to get people on-board to buy local, create, recycle, swap and share,” Ms Majer told the Times.

“Thinking local keeps money circulating in our economy, supports local businesses, develops a more resilient community, and reduces our greenhouse gas emissions. It’s a win-win.”

The funding decision was made during debate about the Shire’s Environmental Management Fund, which distributed $200,000 to local green projects, but Make It Local was funded separately as unbudgeted expenditure aligned with the Shire’s proposed sustainable economy budget. Make It Local is described as a one-year program “to build the culture of buying, sourcing, producing, creating, sharing and recycling at the local/regional level, and to develop partnerships for a more circular economy and sustainable community”.

It was a “valuable project for the community”, a council report said.

Chamber deputy president Melissa D’Ath said the project would bring together different groups working to boost trade.

“We heard everyone was trying to do something, so we thought ‘Let’s bring it all together’,” she said. “So we are pooling our funds and resources so we’re spearheading the campaign.”

Ms Majer said the idea emerged from the climate action summit held during this year’s Margaret River Pro.

The group was in the planning stages now for a year of events, and more members were welcome, she said.

Not only will speakers be providing useful information, but the event will also present an opportunity for local businesses owners to collaborate in the future. ""I think it's a great opportunity to form collaborative partnerships,"" Mr Sharpe said. ""The more we can get local companies in Moree working together and looking at opportunities to grow together and potentially export to the world, that's what I'd like to unlock. ""Waste is a local thing. It's a local resource that we all have and if we can have a look at new, easy ways we can use waste as a resource, we've got a great opportunity to unlock value."" Mr Sharpe said he has a real focus on regional NSW.

712,It’s about more than just rubbish: Victoria’s circular economy review ignores people,"The Victorian government’s circular economy discussion paper rings alarm bells that a major opportunity to redesign our economy will be missed.

Firstly, by narrowly defining circular economies as just a waste disposal issue, and secondly, by overlooking a key factor in implementing any reform – the engagement of people.

It’s about more than just waste

Victoria’s major recycling crisis is one symptom of how unsustainable our linear waste economy is. So, to release a circular economy plan that focuses almost solely on that issue shows a complete misunderstanding of what circular economies can do beyond sustainable recycling.

It’s not just about recycling. It’s also about value-adding, upcycling, new industries and economic opportunities, increased wellbeing and social connections.
• See our story A tale of salvaged push bikes and the importance of community

Bringing people together is what makes circular economies happen

Circular economies are about people coming together at the sweet spot — the coffee cup recycler who makes napkins, the university who gives unwanted computers to schools in developing countries, the cafe that uses vegetables the major supermarkets don’t want because they’re oddly shaped, and using more sustainable materials such as recycled cotton and polyester, wood fibres and natural rubber in the fashion industry.

Circl in Amsterdam is already using circular economy practises in its restaurants, such as using seasonal products, rain water collection on site, and on site photovoltaic panels.

Next, the management wanted to further reduce the energy use in the restaurants by 10 per cent each year. This led to practices such as low wattage lighting, using stairs instead of lifts, energy efficient kitchen practices and waste reduction measures. The staff in the restaurant are also devising ways of preserving food without fridges and freezers.

To find these sweet spots, where everyone wins at no cost to the system, entrepreneurs and industry need to be brought together: collaborative spaces, roundtables, living labs and online virtual innovation hubs.

This is what the experience in the EU shows us. For example, the QO Hotel in Amsterdam is designed not just to be a hotel but also offer a sustainable lifestyle destination with much of its food coming from its roof garden.

De Ceuvel is a commercial site in Amsterdam that has been transformed from a polluted shipyard into a sustainable residential area built largely out of recycled materials, such as old houseboats bought for 1 Euro. It produces its own energy using a smart grid and recycles its wastewater.

Closer to home, the KTPH (Khoo Tech Puat Hospital) in Singapore uses minimum air conditioning, it grows herbs and some vegetables on site, and even uses fish for food from its own fish pond.

These are mainly managed by volunteers.

These examples demonstrate what governments must do to support circular economies, yet any provision or discussion of this in the Victorian government’s plan is completely absent.

It’s not just about engaging industry and entrepreneurs, but also the young (who have the greatest appetite and motivation for change — it’s their future). Recognising this, the UN has just released SDG emojis and cartoon characters to engage children on these issues.

What does our government plan to do to engage young people, or any people, on these transformative behavioural change programs? Again, totally silent. Evidence shows reform and behaviour change simply do not happen without engagement.

A major opportunity. Will it be missed?

The government should be applauded for releasing its circular economy discussion paper (albeit nearly a decade behind progress on this issue in the EU), and committing to implement a plan from that (to be released late this year), with $37 million over three years.

But there are glaring omissions that threaten to undermine the whole process, lock-in short term thinking, and define circular economies as a failed experiment for years to come.

She is also the co-lead of the United Nations One Planet Network’s Sustainable Buildings and Construction Programme, (10YFP) on Sustainable Consumption and Production aligned with SDG12.

738,Finalists announced for NZI Sustainable Business Network Awards,"Judges for the 2019 NZI Sustainable Business Network Awards have announced the line-up of finalists after another record year of entries.

CEO of the Sustainable Business Network (SBN) Rachel Brown says the record numbers are a sign of growing business confidence in sustainability.

“Public awareness is at an all-time high and businesses know there is real value in working on sustainability,” she says.

“This year we’ve seen growth in innovation and in new business models. In fact, the category that attracted the highest number of entrants was the Going Circular award, which recognises solutions that are shifting to a low-carbon circular economy. That means designing out waste to keep resources in circulation indefinitely.

“We’re also seeing a large number of new initiatives in the social space, with exceptionally high numbers of entries in the categories for Hardwired for Social Good and Partnering for Good. People and nature are interconnected, so if you improve one, you improve the other.

“Leadership in sustainability is vital, and the finalists in the Sustainability Superstar and Millennial on a Mission categories are diverse, representing a range of ages, sectors, experience and backgrounds. These people are at the forefront of really interesting change.”

Garry Taylor, Executive General Manager of NZI, and the Principal Sponsor of the Awards, says they serve an increasingly important purpose.

“Almost everyone knows that we can’t continue with the business models of old, yet for many, the first step can be the most daunting. And that’s where SBN and the Awards can help, providing role models across a range of industry sectors that have reduced their impact.

“NZI is proud to have supported the Sustainable Business Network, and the national Awards, for the last 12 years. We salute all those organisations that took the time to enter, and those selected as finalists.”

The NZI Sustainable Business Network Awards have been running for 17 years.

The winners will be announced at a black tie ceremony on 28 November at Shed 10 on Auckland’s waterfront. Tickets are now on sale.

The finalists for the 2019 NZI Sustainable Business Network Awards are:

741,Business program grant to tackle SA waste,"The South Australian government will grant $750,000 to extend a business development program to help tackle the state's agricultural waste management.

Ten new companies are to be created under the business incubator program, which is in partnership with start-up services firm Innovyz.

""The South Australian waste sector is a $1 billion industry which employs around 5,000 people statewide,"" Mr Speirs said.

""Agricultural waste is of significant concern because it can lead to greenhouse gas emissions which contributes to our change in climate.

As Veena Sahajwalla, one of Australia's leading engineers, explained, a circular economy is about getting the best value out of our materials, which in turn can lead to innovation, growth and job creation. One example provided was Eastcoast Foods and Beverages on the Central Coast who gives their orange pulp to yoghurt manufacturers and orange skins to farmers for feed. Or another great example: Veema's very own project, using carbon in old car tyres to replace coking coal in steel production. But of course, we have some great examples a bit closer to home. Olympia Yarger, founder of Goterra, collects food waste to re-purpose as fertiliser or feed for meal worms. Meal worms, extremely high in protein, are fit for human consumption and have been described as a cross between a prawn chip and a cashew. Or the Lids 4 Kids Initiative in Goulburn, which collects bottle lids for Envision Hands, based in Victoria, who turn them into new prosthetic limbs using 3D printing. A circular economy is not just a good thing for the environment; reusing or repurposing valuable resources makes good business sense. RDA Southern Inland, RDA ACT and the Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre are running a Circular Economy conference in February 2020, which will hopefully uncover even more great examples of businesses leading the way in this space.",Australia,2019.08

Precycle

 Precycle is a successful service concentrating on removing and recycling discarded building materials from home construction sites. Precycle introduced the concept of the circular economy to an industry that has traditionally seen all waste as just waste. 



Holla-Fresh

 A prime example of the circular economy in action in South Australia. Local company Bio Gro provides wood residue to Holla-Fresh at no cost, for use as a heating fuel. Afterwards, Bio Gro take away the biochar that is produced as a natural part of the pyrolysis process. 



Domiciliary Equipment Service (DES)

 A circular economy analysis funded by Green Industries SA shows the average life for disability equipment under the DES service model is 5.2 years, compared with just six months under a standard model. 



Northern Adelaide Waste Management Authority (NAWMA) 

 NAWMA operates a world leading resource recovery and recycling centre in Adelaide's North in South Australia, a cornerstone of the circular economy in South Australia. 

 



BioGro

 Compostable plastics made in South Australia are one way of addressing single use plastics, local company BioGro have seen their circular economy model lead to big business here and overseas. 



Advanced Plastic Recycling (APR) 

APR are contributing to the circular economy in South Australia by turning waste plastic and waste timber into valuable products for export.

Business keen to work with Government on creating a circular economy

The Government’s initiative to establish regulated product stewardship schemes for priority products to reduce harm posed by certain end-of-life products and design waste out of the system, has the strong support of business.

Michael Barnett, Auckland Business Chamber CEO, welcoming today’s Government announcement noted that stewardship schemes are used extensively in other countries to reduce waste.

The reduction of the waste we produce must always remain a priority. Six proposed priority products have been selected as a stage one step-up of New Zealand’s efforts to turn-around New Zealand’s ‘throw away’ culture to a circular economy of ‘make-use-return’: Tyres, electrical-electronic products, agrichemicals, refrigerants, farm plastics and packaging.

Barnett, who chairs the Waste Management Industry Forum, said a scheme in which people could place their used goods in a container at strategic points around New Zealand makes a lot of sense.

The Forum is keen to collaborate with government in setting up a workable scheme. “China’s National Sword refusing to take New Zealand recyclables and our growth-led economy has resulted in a huge build-up of certain used products.”

A plus in today’s announcement is the strong recognition of the key role that business has in terms of understanding the logistics chain of a products journey from producer-to-customer-to-dispose.

“We have already engaged with Government on its initiative and look forward to making a positive, cost-effective and efficient difference to reducing waste in our economy.”",New Zealand,2019.08
921,Government buy-recyclables targets could turbocharge circular economy,"Public sector targets for procuring products with recycled content could be the game-changer the Australian recycling sector desperately needs.

Collectively, the federal, state and local government sector is responsible for billions of dollars of spend annually on products and services. In 2017-18, the federal government put contracts worth $71.1 billion out to market via AusTender – and that’s only a fraction of the total public sector spend across all levels of government.

Around 95 per cent of the federal contracts went to businesses with an Australian-registered address, and 85 per cent of suppliers in 2017-18 were small to medium enterprises.

The scale is massive. It’s no wonder the recent announcement by assistant minister for waste and recycling Trevor Evans that the state and federal environment ministers may agree to procurement targets around recycled content for public projects has got the recycling industry excited.

According to Government News, the federal, state and territory environment ministers are expected to decide on a target at the Ninth Meeting of Environment Ministers, due to occur before the end of this year.

The news comes as the crisis around the collection, processing and re-use of Australian recyclables continues to deepen. This past week saw news breaking that multiple councils in Melbourne, including City of Melbourne, have sent recyclables to landfill due to the financial difficulties of SKM Recycling.

The Waste Management and Resource Recovery Association described the target as a major plus for local councils and regional economies as it would stimulate the market for recycled materials produced by local processing operations.

Chief executive of the Supply Chain Sustainability School, Hayley Jarick, told The Fifth Estate it would “no doubt be a game changer for small and medium enterprises who play in this space.”

Every report into sustainability has singled out institutional spending and government spending as “massive drivers” of positive change.

This has already been seen in the commercial property space, where government mandates around NABERS ratings for its tenancies gave the energy-efficiency industry a massive boost and created a new normal for office buildings.

Ms Jarick said one of the biggest barriers for SMEs in the recycled product and circular economy space has been lack of demand to successfully scale up and compete effectively with other products.

There could also be flow-on effect for whole supply chains within the economy.

There may be “hiccups” and adjustments as the momentum builds, as the appropriate level of transparency and disclosure is adopted to demonstrate a product genuinely contains post-consumer recycled content, Ms Jarick said.

What manufacturers and broader industry needs to do now to prepare for the targets and the possibilities they generate is get educated and prepare to scale up.

The entire supply chain also needs to be ready for the “real trend pushing through for transparency in organisations”.

That will mean disclosure of where material comes from, how it is processed and how it’s arriving on site.

Ms Jarick said that while there are some companies operating in a “race to the bottom” manner, there are already some leaders and innovators in the circular economy space.

A recent School event on the topic saw industry players including GPT, Mirvac, Plastic Forests, and government agencies such as the EPA, come together to discuss progress and growth of circular approaches.

A shift towards targets for procurement could also be the shot in the arm Australian manufacturing, and especially manufacturing in regional areas, needs.

Ms Jarick says Australian manufacturing is in an interesting space.

Australians need to “do what they do best and innovate.”

She says that while circular economy focused procurement won’t replace sustainability policies in general, as an element of sustainability, greater uptake would be a “great step towards improving the whole.”

SMEs are well-positioned to scale up, Ms Jarick says, as they are “super-agile” and able to adapt their practices and products quickly.

There are also some larger firms that are “ready to go” if the demand is there.

“The United Nations, state, federal and local governments have been talking about this for years. [And] there are people in the market who are setting themselves up to succeed.

“It makes good business sense. It makes good environmental sense. It makes good economic sense in terms of jobs and regional economies.

“Now we have the burning platform of [the situation] where we cannot export our waste anymore, so it either goes to landfill or we use it productively.”

Some of the states are already ahead of the game. Victoria has both a social procurement framework that preferences Victorian enterprises and also last year announced a green procurement initiative.
• See our story – Victoria commits to “recyclables first” procurement policy.

Queensland has also decided to go a bit circular, with research, investment and procurement around recycled materials part of the government’s new waste strategy.

New South Wales, however, does not appear to have set any firm goals or targets, and Green Industries South Australia noted in a submission to an SA productivity Commission Inquiry into government procurement late last year that the SA government needs to do more to ensure procurement is driving positive change.",Australia,2019.08

• Read more HY William: Working with refugees to tap creative potential

This has a local focus, he explains, including exploring housing affordability in Sydney from a social sustainability viewpoint, and looking at alternative models for new developments.

This involves looking at where community “fits in” to affordable housing models, and whether there is a need for “community excellence”.

Circular economy and the role of cities in addressing sustainability are driving passions.

Chan, who is also a Global Shaper with the World Economic Forum and this year headlined a sold-out session at TEDxSydney, says a “startup” attitude is required for the urban planning profession.

“Cities are powerful incubators for innovation towards addressing the pressing global challenge of rapid urbanisation,” Chan says.

“We need more entrepreneurship within urban development so that Australian cities have the foresight in environmental resilience and social inclusion.”

Chan’s sustainability advocacy includes championing the architecture and urban planning professions at the UN General Assembly in New York and the International Union of Architects (UIA) General Assembly in Durban on behalf of the Australian Institute of Architects alongside Jill Garner, Victoria Government Architect, and Graham Burrows, Jackson Clements Burrows.

He sees a clear role for his profession in spearheading change.

970,Lithium Australia drill results confirm maiden lithium discovery at Youanmi,"( ) has received the results of its maiden reverse circulation (RC) drill program at the Youanmi Lithium Project in Western Australia.

Drilling was following up rock chip samples grading up to 4.2% and the first batch of results from the 54-hole program has confirmed mineralisation over 1,200 metres of strike.

Highlights from the drilling include 8 metres at 1.39% lithium oxide from 8 metres, 7 metres at 1.42% lithium oxide from 20 metres and 6 metres at 1.64% lithium oxide from 11 metres.

Positively, the extent of the shallow-dripping pegmatites that host the lithium is greater than expected. Further assays are expected by the end of August.

READ: Lithium Australia hits lithium intervals in 36 of 37 holes at Youanmi

LIT’s managing director Adrian Griffin said: “These great results from our first-pass drilling programme vindicate our exploration model.

“Good widths of high-grade lithium mineralisation in pegmatites are reported at Youanmi, including 8 metres at 1.39% Li2O and 7 metres at 1.42% Li2O from 20 metres, with results from 19 holes pending.

“Importantly, the mineralisation is shallow and remains open down dip and along strike.

“The lithium is hosted in lepidolite, a lithium mica ideally suited to processing by our proprietary SiLeach® technology.

“Initial results suggest Youanmi could provide critical local feedstock for our lithium-cathode and battery business units.”

69,Environment Department Statements,"Queensland, and the rest of Australia, are fighting a war on waste.

The decision of China and Malaysia has revealed how exposed Australia’s waste management system is, and how reliant we are on off-shore processors and markets.

The Queensland Government is modernising waste management. We have set a path forward for Queensland to help grow the recycling and resource recovery industry.

At the moment, Queensland is generating waste faster than it is growing in population. We also only recycle about 45% of our waste.

We know this needs to change, and that is why the Government is investing in a range of measures to decrease waste and improve recycling rates.

Last year, we introduced a ban on single-use plastic bags. Since then, we have seen a 70% drop in plastic bag litter.

Last year we also implemented the container refund scheme, where Queenslanders can get a 10-cent refund for recycling their drink containers.

Since it was implemented on November 1, more than 700 million containers have been returned across Queensland, and we’ve also seen a 35% reduction of containers ending up as litter.

Last month the Queensland Government implemented a waste levy. Queensland used to be the only mainland state in Australia without a levy, and we have now been brought in line with the rest of the country.

Revenue from the levy will help fund critical infrastructure and help grow recycling and waste industries, and ultimately create a market in Queensland where we can recycle more of our waste.

There are huge economic opportunities in recycling, including the ability to create more jobs. For every 10,000 tonnes of waste sent to landfill, less than three jobs are supported. But if that same waste was recycled, this would support more than nine jobs.

In July 2019 the Queensland Government released a new Waste Management and Resource Recovery Strategy to help Queensland move towards a “circular economy”. This Strategy has also set long-term targets, including, by 2050:
• 10% of all waste going to landfill

These targets are expected to create 3000 jobs in the waste and recycling industry within a decade.

The NSW Government supports COAG’s decision to develop a timetable to ban the export of waste products while building our capacity to generate high value products.

NSW is working on a 20 Year Waste Strategy and a comprehensive plan to tackle plastics which will complement the COAG work.

The NSW Government’s commitment of more than $800 million for waste and recycling initiatives under the Waste Less, Recycle More program, is the nation’s largest recycling program. It’s through this initiative that Roads and Maritime Services have completed successful trials of using recycled glass in our roads. I’m thrilled to say it’s been so successful they have now increased the allowable amount of recycled crushed glass to be used in road base, from 2.5% to 10%. Initiatives like this is how we’re developing new uses for recycled material.

The waste levy aims to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill and promote recycling. Since its introduction, recycling has increased. The NSW Government apportions revenue from the waste levy across a number of public services. One third of the waste levy is used to fund environmental programs, such as the Waste Less, Recycle More initiative. The remaining two thirds fund essential government services, such as schools, hospitals and roads.

My Commonwealth and State colleagues have a target of 100% of Australian packaging being recyclable, compostable or reusable by 2025.

Managing our waste is one of our major environmental challenges and the NSW Government is committed to delivering a better, cleaner environment in NSW for future generations.

The Victorian government is working closely with industry, local governments and the community to address current disruptions to recycling systems and ensure as much recycling as possible is processed.

We’re also working on a range of longer-term strategies and initiatives to increase domestic processing, ensure less contamination and reduce the amount of waste produced in the first place.

We have built a strong foundation for Victoria’s transitioning waste industry, through record funding of more than $135 million over the last four years in the waste and resource recovery sector. This includes $37 million to deliver the Recycling Industry Strategic Plan and the recently announced $34.9 million for more recycling support measures.

The Recycling Industry Strategic Plan is about the long-term transition of the sector that will help create the extra recycling capacity that Victoria needs to be ready for any future disruptions.

Victoria has led the way in modernising the waste industry, as the first Australian jurisdiction to have in place a comprehensive, long-term waste and resource recovery infrastructure planning framework.

Victoria is also developing a circular economy policy that will build on our strong record of continuously improving our waste management and resource recovery capabilities.

The policy will identify new ways for Victorian businesses and communities to use materials more efficiently and avoid waste in all stages of making, using and disposing of the products and infrastructure we rely on every day. Victoria’s infrastructure projects are already benefitting from a truly circular economy with trains travelling through Richmond are now running on railway sleepers made from recycled plastic.

Over the past four years, the Victorian Government has been delivering a comprehensive suite of waste and resource recovery initiatives to develop and grow a sustainable resource recovery network for all Victorians and build the state’s capacity to respond to the shifting global trends including:

In addition, the Victorian Government is identifying opportunities to incorporate recycled content into its procurement activity, which will further drive demand and build domestic markets for recycled materials.

These strategies have established Victoria as a national leader in building markets for recovered resources, fast tracking the state’s shift to a more circular economy.
• Victoria is leading the way in developing a circular economy policy that will build on our strong record of continuously improving our waste management and resource recovery capabilities.
• We are working with experts from across industry and engaging with local governments and communities across the state.
• This is about investing in ways to turn waste and recycled products into valuable materials, and we’re making sure we get it right.
• This means taking a ‘borrow-use-return’ approach, where things are re-used, repaired or recycled rather than going to landfill.
• The circular economy will deliver better environmental, social and economic results for Victoria.
• We are supporting the Victorian recycling sector so we can make more from our recycling.
• The Victorian Government has provided $19.1 million to 60 infrastructure projects in metropolitan and regional Victoria through the Resource Recovery Infrastructure Fund since 2017.
• These projects are expected to create more than 400 jobs in Victoria’s waste and resource recovery sector and divert at least 900,000 tonnes of material from landfill each year.
• Victoria is getting on with transforming the state’s recycling industry, working with local government on a major overhaul of kerbside collection, that will seek innovative and cost-effective designs that could include additional household bins to reduce waste contamination.
• This may include extra bins for households to improve the separation of waste, making it easier to recycle materials.
• Everyone has a role to play in reducing the amount of waste that goes to landfill, including businesses and householders.
• We’re investing in recycling infrastructure to create a more stable and productive recycling industry.
• Victoria is now home to a new state-of-the-art plastics recycling plant in Melbourne’s north that is set to process 70,000 tonnes of plastic each year - equivalent to almost half of all plastics currently recovered across the state. This project was supported by the $26.1 million Resource Recovery Infrastructure Fund.
• For every kilometre of railway track installed with sleepers which are made from 85% plastic waste, 64 tonnes of plastic waste that would have otherwise gone to landfill is recycled.
• Four million glass bottles per day are processed into 800 tonnes of construction sand to be used in Big Build construction projects.
• For every 300 metres of recycled green roads, we use 530,000 plastic bags, 168 glass bottles 12,500 used printer cartridges and 134 tonnes of reclaimed road asphalt.
• The Metropolitan Waste and Resource Recovery Group (MWRRG) has led and continues to deliver the organics network that processes Melbourne’s green and, increasingly, food waste. The capacity of the organics processing network now exceeds the Metropolitan Waste and Resource Recovery Implementation Plan 2021 target by 120,000 tonnes.
• In 2014, Moira Shire introduced a kerbside food and green waste collection service. The strength of the partnership between the council, the regional waste and resource recovery group, the collection contractor and the organics processor has seen the service achieve one of the lowest contamination rates in the state, at less than 0.3 per cent.
• We have banned e-waste from Victoria’s landfill
• To support the rollout of the ban we have invested $16.5 million to upgrade e-waste collection and storage facilities across the state, and develop an e-waste education and awareness campaign.
• The e-waste ban reduces the need to extract raw materials from the earth.
• A consistent three bin kerbside collection system, which includes separation of food organics and garden organics from other waste categories, to be provided by all local governments in the Perth and Peel region by 2025 and supported by State Government through the application of financial mechanisms.
• Implement local government waste plans, which align local government waste planning processes with the Waste Avoidance and Resource Recovery Strategy 2030.
• Implement sustainable government procurement practices that encourage greater use of recycled products and support local market development.
• Provide funding to promote the recovery of more value and resources from waste with an emphasis on focus materials.
• Review the scope and application of the waste levy to ensure it meets the objectives of Waste Avoidance and Resource Recovery Strategy 2030 and establish a schedule of future waste levy rates with the initial schedule providing a minimum five year horizon.
• Develop state-wide communications to support consistent messaging on waste avoidance, resource recovery and appropriate waste disposal behaviours.
• Review and update data collection and reporting systems to allow waste generation, recovery and disposal performance to be assessed in a timely manner.
• Undertake a strategic review of Western Australia’s waste infrastructure (including landfills) by 2020 to guide future infrastructure development.

It’s important not to over-simplify what China’s National Sword Policy is and does. China still accept (and actually pay a premium for) processed and sorted plastic waste. What China did was to stop accepting mixed materials, or materials that were considered too dirty to be easily reprocessed. That’s not the same as China just not taking any materials back. Often the outcome is the same interstate where the sorting and recovery process is not as advanced as it is in South Australia. In South Australia, beverage containers have a ten cent deposit on them. SA has had this for 42 years, since 1977. This means SA has deeply ingrained cultural behaviours the rest of the country just doesn’t have when it comes to recycling and recovery. We also have deeply embedded infrastructure: All South Aussies know where the local ‘bottle depot’ is in their neighbourhood. These are institutions in SA as are the characters who work at them. At these depots plastic and glass is sorted into various colour streams: clear, green, and amber. This is a very important distinction because that simple process of sorting our waste makes the material much, much more valuable and easier to sell. Amber glass can’t be made ‘clear’. So the wine industry here – which consumes almost all the recycled glass – pays a premium for pre-sorted glass.

The same is true of plastics: with black plastic being the least sought after because it can’t be tinted or coloured back into another colour like white or clear. But since China’s National Sword Policy, South Australia has invested considerably in better, smarter, and faster systems to not only sort waste plastic, but to process it into a raw material (plastic ‘pellets’) that China actually pay a premium for. This is effectively a way in SA to move to a more circular economy and turn what was a waste product into a raw material or resource – one that China will happily accept.

Local processors Recycled Plastics Australia (RPA) received a loan from the South Australian Government to ‘tool up’ and fit out a factory with state of the art kit to turn not just South Australia’s waste plastic, but waste plastic from around the country into an export quality raw material (pelletised plastic). The main market for this material is China. So It’s important to understand that SA has pivoted quickly to respond to the challenge. Funding from the South Australian Government to address the impact of the National Sword policy in SA has been in place since May 2018. So while we welcome recent announcements by Prime Minister Scott Morrison on plans to stop exporting any recyclable materials or waste, it’s something SA has been heading towards well ahead of the rest of the country – as usual.

When funding was announced in 2018 by the South Australian Government to invest 12m in responding to National Sword, one of the most important aspects of this funding was to spend time and effort on researching householder attitudes towards recycling to understand barriers, challenges and values around how and why people recycle, and to develop a single, consistent statewide message on recycling. This led to the creation of the Which Bin campaign (www.WhichBin.sa.gov.au, www.facebook.com/whichbin and http://bit.ly/whichbinads). These commercials were the first time that SA had seen prime time advertising on how and why to recycle. Including a print media campaign, outdoor advertising, social media support and a dedicated Which Bin hotline, The South Australian Government is on the front foot in showing its commitment to improving the quality of recycling and to diverting as much as possible from landfill. No other state has yet adopted the ‘Which Bin? Just Ask Vin’ messaging, or committed to a prime time, traditional TV advertising campaign to get into people’s homes, and their hearts and minds to improve their bin behaviour and increase recycling knowledge and know-how at the kerbside level.

South Australia diverts 83.6 % of all waste from landfill. This is a world leading result. But ‘waste’ production is on the increase. Make no mistake – we are all creating more waste. Through consumption, packaging and our general attitude towards disposable, single use or short term consumer items, waste is on the increase, not the decline. In one respect this makes SA’s result all the more impressive, because even with more waste being generated, we still managed a slight reduction from landfill last year.

Questions about how much waste and what we recycle are all quickly available in the SA Recycling Activity report here:

Businesses in SA are also actively seeking to move towards a more circular economy to not only avoid waste but to develop new markets for recycled content product. We strongly recommend watching some of these videos that showcase just how diverse and world leading some of the ideas out of South Australia – they are eye openers to most people:

Turning waste plastic and waste timber into valuable products for export

A prime example of the circular economy in action in South Australia. Local company Bio Gro provides wood residue to Holla-Fresh at no cost, for use as a heating fuel. Afterwards, Bio Gro take away the biochar that is produced:

The story for SA is:

We have a long track record of recycling, and it’s part of the DNA in SA

We responded faster and more strategically through grants, funding, advocacy and education campaigns

SA remains rightly proud of its commitment: The first state to introduce ten cent deposits (1977), the first state to introduce a plastic bag ban (2009), the first state to commit to a single statewide education and advertising message on recycling (2018) and the first state to kick off a multi-region Plastic Free Places trial, which includes three major retail and shopping areas (The Parade, Norwood, The Adelaide Central Markets, Jetty Road Brighton) and in a world first, all 21 Surf Life Saving clubs have joined together to trial going ‘single-use plastic free’.

Shifts in global resource markets, such as the bans on waste imports under China’s “National Sword” policy are having an impact both across Australia and the globe. It is an area that needs ongoing attention, however the effects in the ACT have been limited.

The ACT Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) in Hume is operated by Re.Group. Apart from contamination, which is sent to landfill, the MRF operator advises that all recyclable materials are sold to market as part of their standard business model. This depends on market demand at the time, although the bulk of the material processed at the MRF (over 95%) is sold on the domestic market and consists of:
• Around 45-55% of material (by weight) is paper and cardboard. This is sent to a paper mill at Tumut in NSW.
• Around 30-35% is glass, which is turned into sand and sold locally.
• Other materials (ie plastic, aluminium and steel) are sold to a variety of end users based on market demand.

The ACT has a high overall resource recovery rate of around 70% for the last decade. The ACT Government’s Waste Feasibility Study in May 2018 provided a set of recommendations and a roadmap aimed at diverting and additional 170,000 tonnes of waste from landfill to head towards an 87% overall resource recovery rate in the ACT.

We have already implemented a number of these recommendations, including the Container Deposit Scheme, which as at 25 August 2019 has also seen over 33 million containers returned since the scheme began in June 2018. The government is also investigating options for increased food organics recycling and has consulted the community on developing a policy on using waste to generate energy. The government also completed a review of the development code for waste management to improve recycling outcomes in new apartment complexes. The Government has also consulted on a discussion paper on phasing out unnecessary and problematic single-use plastics.

We are now focusing on:
• Developing a detailed feasibility study into maximising diversion of organic waste from landfill, including through the delivery of a food and garden organics process site and facility, products and markets.
• Development of a pilot education campaign on food waste avoidance.
• Examining options to phase-out avoidable single-use plastics in the ACT.
• Further developing the ACT waste levy to discourage landfill and make recycling more attractive.

We also have a significant ongoing community awareness and engagement program, including:
• Our Recycling Discovery Hub and outreach program, reaching around 6,000 residents every year.
• Education campaigns such as the ‘#RecycleRight’ campaign.
• Participating in initiatives such as National Recycling Week, which will be held 11-17 November 2019.
• Designing behaviour change interventions for better recycling outcomes in multi-unit developments.
• A new and improved ‘Recyclopaedia’, where residents can go to find out if hundreds of everyday items can be reused, repurposed or recycled.

The ACT Government continues to work with our local, state and federal counterparts, with an agreement at the recent Council of Australian Governments meeting to establish a timetable to ban the export of waste plastic, paper, glass and tyres, while building Australia’s capacity to generate high value recycled commodities and associated demand, and establish an agreed set of actions under the National Waste Policy.
• All Territorians have responsibility to reduce, reuse and recycle its waste, including plastics.
• The NT is supportive of developing a national approach to banning exports of waste from Australia whilst maintaining trade in recyclables.
• Recovering, reuse and recycling waste should be viewed as an opportunity to develop new commodities and markets.
• Governments have a role in supporting industry in recovery, reuse and recycling of materials.
• In April 2018, Environment Ministers from all states and territories committed that all Australian packaging must be recyclable, compostable or reusable by 2025 or earlier. The National Waste Policy More Resources, Less Waste 2018 outlines the key strategies to deliver on this target. Industry and governments across Australia are actively implementing actions to deliver this commitment. This includes better understanding the plastics and other wastes generated across Australia, potential markets for reuse and recycling, identifying barriers and opportunities for a circular economy for waste and exploration of options for material re-design.
• The NT is part of the national working group developing the national action plan for consideration at the Meeting of Environment Ministers (MEM) at its next meeting.
• The NT generates approximately 347 kilo-tonnes of waste per annual (less than 1% of Australia’s total waste).
• The recycling rate in the NT is approximately 11%.
• Construction and Demolition waste and Commercial and Industrial waste makes up approximately 75% of the NT’s waste.",Australia,2019.09
76,Business on Board PM's Circular Economy,"Australian businesses believe there is no choice but to create a “circular economy”, but they need state governments and councils make their waste and recycling laws consistent.

In the United States, Prime Minister Scott Morrison flagged the circular economy as a priority for Australia, weaving together jobs, economic efficiency and the environment.

“I want Australia to be at the vanguard of leading an industry-led approach to a circular economy, not a government regulatory approach to that,” Mr Morrison said at an event in New York on Monday.

“I mean, industry has the wit and the capital to do it and to make a dollar out of it, and once we’re making a dollar out of it, you won’t stop us.”

He said while 80 per cent of recycled paper is turned into cardboard in Australia, just 12 per cent of plastics are recycled.

“We’ve got to get that number up. And that requires technology. But the other thing that’s going to require is a commercial industry that actually does it,” Mr Morrison said.

Australia’s recycling industry has been in crisis since Asian countries banned waste imports, and a number of local recyclers were forced to shut down due to dangerous stockpiling.

Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive James Pearson said businesses were ready to get started, but they need consistency from governments.

“I don’t think we have much choice. I think it will drive innovation,” Mr Pearson told told reporters.

“Our members are already innovating, they’re already involved in this space, they’d love to see the red tape reduced, they’d love to see government encouraging consistency.

“They know government can play a key role as a procurer.

“For example, big infrastructure projects that are rolling out across the country, (there are) major opportunities to use recycled material there in road works.”

But Mr Pearson said the state-by-state laws were so different that a national approach was needed to bring them into line.

“The more consistency we can have across the country, then we’re more like to get economies of scale,” he said.

“We’re more likely to be able to efficiently and effectively produce different waste streams into more valuable and more useful inputs.”

A recent EY report found Australia could be $328 million better off each year if recycling was treated like a resource instead of rubbish.

It found Australia’s current co-mingled method of recycling reduced the value from a typical kerbside bin to as low as $2-a-tonne.

That could go as high as $156-a-tonne if the recycling was sorted better.",Australia,2019.09

122,Climate change strategy for business,"OPINION: As a business manager how do you plan for climate change? It's the gravest threat to business according to the World Economic Forum's 2019 report. What are the challenges and opportunities for your business?

Considering any issue early means that it will be easier for you to respond. Not only that, the opportunities are large. The Sustainable Business Network's research, carried out with Auckland Tourism Events & Economic Development, shows Auckland could be $8.8 billion better off in 2030 if the city makes the transition to a low carbon circular economy. Their report identifies opportunities for food, transport and the built environment.

What are your customers and staff thinking?

Kiwis are already prioritising for climate change in their decision making. A Victoria University survey of 9000 New Zealanders showed 74.5 per cent said they'd already made some sacrifices for this. Also 90 per cent of those taking part in the 2018 Colmar Brunton national survey ""Better Futures"" agreed that if a company is ""irresponsible or unethical, I'd stop buying their products or using their services"".

 * 'Circular economy' could bring $8b in benefits to Auckland

Internationally, nearly 90 per cent of adults are willing to change their personal behaviour to help tackle climate change. This was the finding of a survey of 14,000 adults from 14 countries completed for IKEA.

Your business's response will also affect your ability to hire and retain staff. In New Zealand, 86 per cent of those surveyed by Colmar Brunton agreed that ""It is important for me to work for a company that is socially and environmentally responsible.""

A ""Zero Carbon Act"" is expected to come into force late this year. The current draft has targets to reduce all greenhouse gases. Methane has a 2030 target reduction of 10 per cent, and a provisional target of 24-47 per cent reduction by 2050. All other greenhouse gases have a target of net zero by 2050. The costs for a business to emit greenhouse gases are certain to rise.

As a society we are expecting business to show leadership on climate change. From the 2019 Edelman Trust Barometer survey, 76 per cent of people said CEOs should take the lead on change, rather than waiting for government to impose it - an 11-point increase from last year.

Even in the USA, business is no longer just about shareholder returns. The Business Roundtable issues Principles of Corporate Governance. Since 1997 the principles have stated that corporations exist principally to serve shareholders. Radically changed in August 2019, the business goals now include creating ""value for customers,"" ""investing in employees,"" ""dealing fairly... with suppliers,"" ""supporting communities,"" and ""protect[ing] the environment.""

What can your business do?

First, measure your footprint. As management expert Peter Drucker said: ""What gets measured gets managed."" Your main emissions are likely to be from fuel, flights, power, vehicles, freight and waste. If you are farming, methane may be a part too.

There are free online calculators. For support and independent verification, businesses such as Ekos and Enviro-Mark Solutions can help. For small businesses, measurement can be just a few hundred dollars with Ekos – a good investment to understand your emissions.

Once you know where your emissions are, then you can look at how to reduce them. Can you use video for some meetings rather than flying? Where can you reduce waste? Could your next vehicle replacement be electric? Most of these options come with the additional benefit of cost savings.

Finally, you can offset any carbon emissions you can't avoid.

There are many examples of firms making efforts in this space, to look to for inspiration. At one end of the scale The Warehouse Group is now certified as carbon neutral. The company states, ""As New Zealand's largest retail group, we have an ethical obligation to act now.""

At the other end of the scale is the Chia Sisters, creating nutritious beverages in Nelson. As part of the company's policy to include the environment as a true cost of doing business they've offset 120 per cent of their emissions, to be 'climate positive'.

""It is important that our business is a voice for sustainability,"" founder Chloe van Dyke says.

Being certified and offsetting emissions cost their business about $1000. Chia Sisters have been overwhelmed by the positive response, with domestic sales growing by 50 per cent since they became certified.

Response will take a community-wide effort, so let's share and learn from others. Talk to your team - they know your business and can help with ideas. Talk to your industry and local business community; support sector-wide leadership.

Your customers and employees are already thinking about climate change. How is your business responding?

Putting your head in the sand on this issue is not a reasonable strategic response.

Your approach doesn't need to be perfect, but you do need to act.

132,The future of manufacturing is garbage,"A while ago I blogged about Viridi, a clever bunch that is developing a way to salvage grape sugar, tartaric acid and antioxidants from wine waste.

The Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre has also supported work by Dresden Optics, helping them automate and scale up production, in collaboration with Consonic, University of NSW and others. They’re using things like reclaimed fishing nets and beer keg lids to make eyewear and aim to one day use 100 per cent recycled plastics as their feedstock.

Why am I mentioning wine and spectacles? It’s because these two manufacturers are part of an interesting current trend.

Beyond our shores, Adidas has committed to completely phase out virgin polymer by 2024. It intends to make 11 million pairs of recycled shoescontaining recycled plastic this year, in collaboration with Parley for the Oceans. We recently saw news that a new Swedish bike manufacturer, in collaboration with Nestle, is making high-end rides out of aluminium from Nescafe pods.

In case you hadn’t guessed already, what we are talking about is the ‘Circular Economy,’ a topic that seems to be everywhere at the moment.

In simple terms given by the Ellen Macarthur Foundation, the concept is based on three principles:

● Keep products and materials in use

It might have hippy connotations for a few, but Circular Economy is about some pretty old, common-sense ideas – minimising waste and getting the most value out of the resources that have been paid for. This is the stuff of Manufacturing 101.

The concept aligns nicely with Advanced Manufacturing, and we have seen our Man-In-A-Suitcase Michael Sharpe at a tonne of Circular Economy events lately. He brings back to us that manufacturers are interested, but there’s some uncertainty around how exactly to proceed.

Downer and others are turning waste into road surfaces. 530,000 plastic bags, 168,000 glass bottles, 12,000 toner cartridges and 135 tonnes of recycled asphalt go into every kilometre of two-lane road.

The work of Professor Veena Sahajwalla, founding director of University of NSW’s award-winning Sustainable Materials Research and Technology (SMaRT) Centre, is another high-impact example. She is the inventor of “Green Steel” process, in collaboration with OneSteel and then MolyCop.

Green Steel, or Polymer Injection Technology, uses old tyres as a substitute for coke for the carbon used in steelmaking. This has saved millions of tyres from the tip so far. An estimated 56 million passenger car tyres are thrown out by Australians every year, with only a tenth of these reused. Given these huge quantities and the slowness of tyres to break down, Sahajwalla’s work has obvious appeal.

It’s no coincidence that each of these projects is a collaborative one. Manufacturers, researchers, waste collectors and others must work together for Circular Economy initiatives to succeed.

Australian governments will soon set a total ban on exporting recyclables. Given this, smarter use of our waste can only become more important. There are opportunities for smart manufacturers to step up.

227,The beating heart of the Māori economy,"Every year Matariki X brings Māori innovators and entrepreneurs together to share their experiences and inspire one another. Callaghan Innovation’s Vinnie Campbell says the Māori economy’s biggest strengths have nothing to do with money.

This story was funded by The Spinoff Members. For more about becoming a member and supporting The Spinoff’s journalism click here.

Vinnie Campbell (Ngāi Te Rangi, Ngāti Pukenga) is chatting happily with dozens of people as they criss cross the foyer at Rotorua’s Enery Events Centre. Callaghan Innovation’s acting group manager for the Māori economy is finally able to relax now that months of work is coming to fruition at Matariki X, the Māori economy’s largest annual event.

It’s the fourth year of the event, which started with a humble 50 attendees and now easily fills the main theatre. “It’s definitely changed and evolved from our first one!” he says. “The kaupapa was simply to inspire. To be entrepreneurs, innovators. Simply come along and listen to te ao Māori’s best and brightest entrepreneurs.”

This year the full-day event involves a morning of speakers from different business disciplines, an afternoon of masterclasses and a drinks and dinner “eco-connect” event hosted by 2019 Innovator of the Year, Ian Taylor. Attendees can plan their day and interact with speakers via a dedicated app.

Inspiration is the name of the game, but at the end of the day, it’s the connections that give Matariki X so much meaning, says Campbell.

“Of all the great things that have come from Matariki X, the main thing has been connections; the networking. Not just the participants that come along to listen but the speakers and panellists. The Matariki alumni!”

He lists the star speakers that have come through their doors – Steve Saunders, Jason Witehera, Bailey Mackey, Rachel Taulelei, Miriana Stephens.

“None of them knew one another, or if they did, they didn’t know them well. The connection they’ve made here has strengthened the Māori economy exponentially.”

Campbell is adamant it doesn’t matter the size of the business venture – the whakawhanaungatanga that happens at Matariki X puts everyone on an even footing. “The small and medium-sized, the pre-revenue company right up to the Ngāi Tahus of this world. It doesn’t matter.”

Because Māori IP is in such high demand, Matariki X and Callaghan’s Māori development team have a strong focus on international markets. The 12 masterclasses on offer include the circular economy, social impact, investment and building a global business. “A lot of our exemplars are big players on the words stage. They’re commercialising their ideas, commercialising their products. That’s what we wanted to expose people to.”

The key message from their speakers is always the same – innovation means nothing without hard work. “Bailey Mackay [owner/founder of Pango Productions], hard core Ngāti Porou; Steve Saunders [of Robotics Plus], Tauranga Moana, started right from the bottom and got where they are today with hard work. We wanted to expose people to the hard work that is needed to be successful. All our speakers exemplify that It doesn’t happen over night, you’ve got to have resilience. And persistence.”

In addition to the hard graft, he says the most successful projects are those with a point of difference – which is innate for Māori. “We took some Māori kids to Stanford [University], Silicon Valley and a few other places in the States four years ago. The Silicon Valley guys were asking the kids: ‘What’s your point of difference? Your culture!’ These are guys that have just sold $500 million companies.”

He stresses that for entrepreneurs here or in Silicon Valley, money is rarely the first or even second step. “Many of these people we talked to over there said they had no money when they started, but they had an idea. How did they become successful? They surrounded themselves with smart people, mates from uni for instance. They knocked on 145 doors and behind the 146th door someone said ‘yes, I will invest in your company’. For our kids and budding entrepreneurs to hear that stuff is just awesome.”

Māori are not typically the first to sing their own praises to the world but Campbell says he’s slowly seeing the whakamā mindset change over time in the business community.

“What’s that whakataukī? ‘E kore te kumara e ki ake mō tōna reka’ (the kūmara does not speak of its own sweetness). Yes, that is a factor, but I think it’s becoming less so. As our people realise, as they grow in the world of innovation and entrepreneurialism and come to grips with the te ao hurihuri (the changing world), that’s becoming less and less of a factor. People actually realise ‘you’ve got to tell your story’. No one else is going to tell it for you.”

Those unique stories have proven popular in markets like Asia, where strong values of family and reciprocity are shared. “One of our points of difference is manaakitanga and whanaungatanga. Looking after your guests. Taking time to get to know your potential business partner. In my opinion the rest of the business world can learn from that. We see mainstream businesses that are all about the mahi. They come into Callaghan Innovation and we put on a mihi whatau for that exact reason. To get to know the person. Find some commonality. That’s one of the keys points about our culture. And manaaki whenua, sustainability.”

He says “green kaupapa” is something Callaghan looks for in all it’s potential business partners. “The good thing about Callahan is that we have contacts globally that are leading the way in sustainability. So we can expose our people to what’s happening on the world stage, not just in our own backyard. Connecting Māori to international whakaaro, events, conferences is something Callahan does particularly well.”

As for next year’s conference, he has faith in the evolution of the event. The heavy hitters won’t always be available, but the next generation of business leaders is already coming through.

“Of course we’ve got some big hitters in the Māori economy but we can’t bring them out every year, people will get sick of them! So we have to find the next generation, the pipeline of awesome entrepreneurs, which is what we’ve got today with the likes of Jesse Armstrong and Billie Jo Ropiha. She’s like, wow!”

244,Logistics must be part of any circular economy strategies,"The Victorian government is developing a circular economy policy and action plan for the state that will be released later, this year.

But critics say the strategy is missing a key component – logistics – and it’s one that is often missing when people think about a circular economy.

RMIT Professor Scott Valentine tells The Fifth Estate that circular economy approaches will mean a gradual shift from the current dependence on long-haul freight and shipping, to shorter trips.

This gives us an opportunity to rethink the whole logistics picture so we can shrink the sector’s emissions, create jobs, stimulate local economies and advance innovation.

Valentine says there has not been enough attention paid to logistics in the Victorian strategy. He and other researchers from RMIT’s CE Hub are urging Victoria to look at the strategy as more than just recycling re-branded.

It is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to align resource efficiency, eco-innovation, behaviour change and waste management in the state.

There are three things we need to have in place and plan for, says Valentine.

Firstly, a materials tracking strategy. We need to understand where the materials are coming from and going to.

Secondly, we need a digital platform to trade materials more efficiently.

Finally, we need a solution for the delivery of materials from vendor to buyer, which is where transport comes in.

There are three main freight modes in Australia: sea, rail and road.

Shipping is generally considered the lowest carbon mode, because the massive cargo weights mean the emissions per tonne of freight are small.

However, the main fuel used – bunker oil, a by-product of crude oil distillation – is highly polluting . There are CO2 emissions from its combustion and the fuels used by most ships have high sulphur oxide emissions, contributing to hundreds of thousands of cases of respiratory disease in portside communities around the world. Sulphur emissions also cause acid rain and degrade coral reefs.

The International Maritime Organisation has passed a resolution that will see all ships required to reduce sulphur emissions from 1 January, 2020 either by switching to low-sulphur bunker oil, and installing “scrubbers” to capture the pollution, or by not using bunker oil at all. Some ships already use liquefied natural gas and others are shifting to heavy biodiesels, which does not require extensive changes to a ship’s engine.

IKEA Transport and Logistics Services is one company that has made a move in this area, announcing in March it was investing in fuelling a container ship with biofuel oil manufactured from waste cooking oil and forest residues. The biofuel is made by Netherlands’ based company GoodFuels.

IKEA says using the new fuel is a step towards realising its plan to reduce emissions per transport shipment by 70 per cent by 2030.

“This is a huge ambition since shipping over the ocean makes up almost 50 per cent of our carbon footprint regarding transports,” said Elisabeth Munck af Rosenschöld, head of sustainability at IKEA Global Transport and Logistics Services.

In the freight world, rail has the second-lowest carbon footprint. Australian freight trains use diesel locomotives but the volume of goods a freight train can carry makes the footprint per tonne smaller than an equivalent tonne of goods carried by the diesel-powered B-Double trucks that dominate the nation’s highways.

If we want to change the freight emissions picture we need shorter, localised and possibly more frequent trips.

Valentine says electric vans and trucks could be used to transport material and goods over short distances.

“It is a move from a global to a geographically close focus and, for short hauls, electric vehicles could provide effective service,” he says.

For example, Japan’s Yamato Black Cat logistics service uses small vans and trucks in a digitally-enabled, “seamless web”, integrating multiple distribution and handling facilities to provide a same-day, rapid freight service that suits the “just-in-time” mentality of Japanese companies.

Despite Australian distances being much greater than those in Japan, a similar approach is possible.

Valentine says technologies such as Radio Frequency Identification [RFID] tagging, smart pallets, digital real-time shipment tracking and warehouse management, electric trucks and vans can all play a role in disrupting the industry and sparking change.

Add in the circular economy factor, where materials are constantly being moved from one site to another, and there’s an opportunity to stimulate the development of distribution, warehousing and logistics nodes in regional communities. If this doesn’t happen, a shift to a circular economy could increase pollution and transportation congestion.

There are plenty of job opportunities, such as managing and operating the digital side of operations, and cleaner, safer jobs managing warehouse functions.

Smarter solutions can also reduce packaging. Specially-designed electric vehicles for carrying materials, including raw materials and liquids, need to be on the drawing board, Valentine says.

“In a circular economy, we can start to minimize packaging materials because we are delivering more inputs than finished products.”

However, new handling techniques would need to be developed, and new business models and practices may emerge. It is not unusual for transport companies to provide warehousing. In the near future, as the circular economy grows, they could be competing with existing waste management companies, who begin to provide transport.

A move into materials tracking, recovery and distribution would be a good add-on for a logistics business. Or perhaps waste management firms will be the ones to add the extra services that make them closed-loop resource movers.

As local webs around materials start to evolve, we will need less long-haul freight traffic, and that means less pollution and traffic on our roads, says Valentine.

“When we start along the path [to a circular economy], we start to ask interesting questions, such as can we co-locate with other players in our supply chain” he says.

“If we try designing a circular economy strategy with a recycling frame of mind, as is currently the case [in Victoria], essential elements will become neglected and corporate uptake jeopardised,” says Valentine.

“If implemented correctly, a circular economy strategy will enhance corporate profitability, reduce resource costs, make Australian industry more competitive and create new business and new jobs.”

He says the researchers, rather than criticising the Victorian government’s initiative, are suggesting that it needs to be considered as a “complex, adaptive system”.

That means all industries, researchers and other experts need to be involved.

“If we have that, we can start to identify some really positive industry initiatives.”",Australia,2019.09
259,South Australian companies reusing and recycling to beat global crisis,"South Australia has embraced the circular economy with a state-wide ban of single-use plastics, a commitment to renewable energy and a roster of reputable companies driving reuse.

Although the United Nations reports that less than 10 per cent of all the world’s plastic is recycled, South Australia diverts more than 80 per cent of its waste from landfill to be composted or reused in the circular economy according to a sustainability report by the South Australian government.

The circular economy, driven by renewable flows of energy, is an adjacent model to the linear economy (create, use, discard) and aims to regenerate a product or material at its end of life.

South Australia’s engagement with the circular economy is demonstrated by the its commitment to sustainability – the state harvests eight gigalitres of storm water annually for reuse and sources more than 50 per cent of its energy from renewable sources – as well as subsidies for these industries and policies.

When South Australian Minister for Environment and Water David Speirs announced the impending ban of single use plastics in July, he said the prohibition of these materials cemented the state as a leader in the war on waste.

Speirs said South Australia is committed to working with the community and stakeholders to address the impacts of single-use plastic “to ensure that we continue to maintain this state’s reputation as a leader in waste management”.

Local companies are leading the way for green innovation, with a range of enterprises breathing new life into materials and engaging with the circular economy.

Here are four innovative companies in South Australia that reuse resources and eliminate unwanted materials.

The Northern Adelaide Waste Management Authority (NAWMA) is a garbage, recycling and green waste collection service that has operated in the state’s capital of Adelaide since 1999.

The company diverts 2,1000 tonnes of material intended for waste through bin collections or commercial pick-ups annually in the Northern region, and 30,000 tonnes from the broader South Australian community.

Eighty-three per cent of all waste it collects is diverted from landfill and what it can’t divert is harvested for methane gas to supplement the solar power that runs the factory.

NAWMA works with local councils to collect waste and sells their harvested recycled materials to other businesses to close the circular economy loop.

NAWMA Education and Projects Coordinator Penelope Morrison said South Australia was the first Australian jurisdiction to have a Circular Economy Strategy and leads the way in waste management.

“With globally competitive recycling rates, a mature resource recovery sector, and engaged stakeholders at all levels, South Australia is looked upon by an international audience on how to responsibly manage resources,” said Morrison.

“NAWMA has made a series of bold commitments, including processing 100 per cent of the yellow bin on Australian Shores by 2020, and working with our councils to purchase 50 per cent of recyclables back in the form of sustainable procurement by 2023.

“These two commitments will singlehandedly transition the resource recovery sector to a circular solution.”

Advanced Plastic Recycling (APR) has transformed discarded materials into furniture and timber alternatives for 16 years.

The company converts melted HDPE (high-density polyethylene) pellets into a wood plastic composite material for private infrastructure pieces such as bollards, benches, boardwalks and more.

The material is a wood plastic blend that makes the products stronger, more weatherable and environmentally friendly because it does not leach chemicals into the ground like treated wood and it reuses unwanted plastic.

CEO Ryan Lokan said South Australia is the most advanced state in Australia in regards to the circular economy, and has largest amount of supportive infrastructure.

“We are an antidote to the recycling crisis in the sense that we then take that pellet and create a product that is both environmentally friendly, sustainable, economic and environmental. It’s an alternative to cutting down trees to pulling up natural resources,” said Lokan.

“Right now those arrows sort of represent the movement of the plastic, whereas what we’re trying to do is turn the arrows around and say it should be based on demand.

“The greater the demand for my products by councils, then the greater the demand I have for clean plastic, and the greater demand he has for mix plastics, and the greater demand they have for positive collections.”

Container Deposit Systems (CDS) has been at the forefront of recycling since 1977 with the introduction of its bottles and containers refund scheme.

CDS employs Semi Auto Return Terminals (ART) which allow customers to return deposit cans, plastic bottles and glass in any condition for a 10c-per-container refund.

The ARTs identify and sort containers through an integration of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technology and a vision counting and sorting system developed by Adelaide-based technology and engineering company SAGE Automation.

CDS aims reduce litter and be an active participant in resource recovery.

Although the Environmental Protection Agency South Australia reports beverage containers make up only 2.8 per cent of litter, the state has a return rate of almost 77 per cent and leads the nation.

SAGE Automation designed the new smart container deposit systems and General Manager Paul Johnson said the terminals are above 99 per cent accurate in counting deposit containers.

“The vision system that identifies the containers is bespoke, and we hope for it to become a national solution.”

Hans Van Schaik has experimented with composted materials, to find their value as a resource, for almost half a decade.

Van Shaik engages with the circular economy by developing and manufacturing mulch, soil and substrates from natural materials that would be discarded for his company Bio Gro.

By diverting green waste from landfill the company can convert materials – some of which is animal waste collected from abattoirs – into high quality products for private and commercial horticultural and agricultural industries, like soil conditioners, mulch and liquid stimulants.

The company also provides wood residue to hydroponic grower Holla-Fresh. Holla-Fresh then provides the plant bi-product biochar – valuable soil in the form of charcoal – to Bio Gro to manufacture products.

Production innovation and marketing manager Darren Free said Bio Gro’s circular recovery business model processes and diverts around 300,000 tonnes of waste a year from landfill.

“Recovered forestry material, construction timbers, agricultural bi-products, green and food organics is composted and processed into a variety of high-quality products,” Free said.

“The pine bark recovered from the timber industry is processed and composted turning it into premium potting mix. This is then used by the nursery industry to grow plants, it’s even used to grow new pine trees. The potting mix is also bagged and sold into the retail market for home gardeners.

“This is an important demonstration of a local company’s endeavours in creating a business model based on landfill diversion and an organic circular economy to reduce harmful gases being released into the atmosphere.”

265,In a circular economy we could 'pay per use',"Circular economy - a couple of words that we are going to hear more about in the near future as the Victorian government develops a circular economy policy in the coming months. The circular economy policy will help in finding new ways for Victorian businesses and communities to use materials more efficiently and avoid waste in all stages of making, using and disposing of the products and infrastructure we rely on every day. The circular economy is designed to replace and address the social and environmental impacts of the current ""linear economy"" with its ""take, make, dispose"" model, depleting finite reserves to create products that end up in landfill. It achieves its objectives through long-lasting design, maintenance, repair, reuse, re-manufacturing, refurbishing, and recycling - reducing waste to zero. The definition of a circular economy has been defined for the Victorian Government policy as: If we consider changing the way we view ownership by changing to an access and performance model then we could see some significant changes to the way we consume. One example is the ""pay per use"" contractual agreements associated with smartphones which could be extended to standard goods such as washing machines, clothes and DIY equipment. This would see us become users rather than consumers. So how is this all going to happen? As we start to see greater emphasis on the collaborative economy that supports use over ownership we can expect to see significant changes in the way we operate in the coming decades.",Australia,2019.09
279,Woolies announces “circular economy” beer made from unused bread,"Supermarket chain Woolworths (ASX:WOW) is the latest company to announce a circular economy-based initiative, with a limited edition release of beer containing re-purposed bread loaves.

In a statement today, Woolworths announced a pale ale named “Loafer”, made by Goulburn’s Tribe Breweries and to be sold through the Woolworths-owned Dan Murphy’s and BWS chains. 50 cents from a $25 six-pack will be given to Feed Appeal, a not-for-profit that fund-raises provides grants to food relief charities.

A claimed 350 kilograms of bread has been used in the batch. This translates to roughly 540 loaves, assuming a 650-gram loaf.

“We’re excited to bring to Australians our first circular economy craft beer.” said Woolworths head of sustainability, Adrian Cullen, in a statement.

Josh Gaudry, head of innovation at Tribe, said the collected bread was part of the base of the brew, and had contributed “the aroma of fresh toast to produce an easy going pale ale with bright hoppy aromas reminiscent of pear and pineapple.”

According to Food Rescue Charity Oz Harvest, bread is “one of the most wasted foods” in Australia, which created an estimated five million tonnes of food waste in 2016-17.

Re-purposing unused bread in beer is not a completely new idea. UK brewer Toast Ale has used surplus bread – toasted, mashed and brewed – to create pale ale. Toast Ale itself was inspired by work by the Brussels Beer Project, according to a 2017 interview with Toast’s founder.

281,Woolies’ surprising plan for unused bread,"Unsold loaves of bread from Woolworths Supermarkets have been repurposed and brewed into ‘Loafer’ — a limited edition pale ale.

The war on food waste at Woolworths has turned biblical with a new plan to convert unsold loaves of bread into beer.

The major supermarket has dubbed the new brew the “first circular economy beer” as more than 350 kilograms of leftover bread will skip landfill and head into vats at Tribe Breweries.

The limited edition Loafer pale ale will be sold exclusively through the company’s partners BWS and Dan Murphy’s and help raise funds for the Feed Appeal which focuses on providing meals to Aussies impacted by food security.

RELATED: Woolworths says it has dramatically reduced wastage

“We like to constantly challenge ourselves in the sustainability and community space and look at how we can make an impact simply by doing things differently,” Woolworths head of sustainability Adrian Cullen said.

“The ability to divert surplus food away from landfill, and to help support our local food rescue partners to help feed Australians that would otherwise go hungry, is a critical part of our day-to-day operations and support of the community.

“We’re excited to bring to Australians our first circular economy craft beer.

“For every 6 pack of Loafer purchased, you will not only help to put a meal on the table for someone in need, but you will also be enjoying a beer that has helped divert unsold loaves of bread from heading to landfill.”

Head of innovation at Goulburn-based Tribe Breweries in regional NSW, Josh Gaudry, who have been entrusted to craft the brew, said the ale is the “best thing since slice bread”.

“We wanted to create a beautiful craft beer and were excited to be able to support Feed Appeal and Woolworths in their fight against hunger and food waste,” he said.

“Through collecting rescued bread from Woolworths, we were able to incorporate this into the base of our brew, and lovingly crafted each beer with the aroma of fresh toast to produce an easy going pale ale with bright hoppy aromas reminiscent of pear and pineapple.”

The money raised will go to the not-for-profit organisation which provides grants to support local charities who deliver food relief programs and meals to vulnerable Australians.

“Feed Appeal is here to help everyday Australian families who rely on food charities in their local community for their next meal,” the organisation’s chief executive Katherine Gokavi-Whaley said.

“All money raised through the purchase of ‘Loafer’ goes directly to community food relief charities to supply ovens, freezers, cool rooms, transport and other vital infrastructure to help them store, cook and share meals often cooked from rescued food to meet the growing demand for food relief.

“We are pleased to see that there is now good beer, doing good on the market.”

The beer will be available until stocks last with 50 cents per six pack going to Feed Appeal and $2 per slab.

291,Recycling vineyard plastics makes circular economy real,"There is no doubt the idea of a circular economy, where manufacturers reclaim used materials to make products that can themselves be recycled again and again, is a great idea.

But getting from the dream to the reality requires such enormous goodwill and co-ordinated effort from manufacturers and end-users, that it very rarely occurs.

In South Australia chemical engineer Uma Preston, director of Sustaining Endeavour, has created what is a poster boy for the circular economy in the state’s massive wine industry.

The problem is obvious, with 240,395 kilometres of vines, winegrowers face a massive problem regularly replacing the driptubes that supply water to the roots – what to do with the used plastic.

Preston has facilitated a network of vineyards, local machinery depots, plastic recyclers and manufacturers to turn driptube that normally go into landfill into useful products.

Preston said: “In this local circular economy, plastic resources are kept at the highest value possible, and made to continuously circulate in a closed loop.

“This is in contrast to linear economies where end-of-life products are disposed to landfill.”

So far 1,500 km of dripperlines have been recycled by Recycling Plastics Australia‘s Kilburn plant north of Adelaide into 110 tonnes of ‘as new’ plastic resin.

Sourced from vineyards including TWE growers and Yalumba from the south-east, d’Arenberg and Wirra Wirra in McLaren Vale, and Henchke in the Barossa, the resin is used to make:

# Netafim’s LDPE Pipe is UV and acid resistant, and made of high quality resins and recycled dripperlines.

# Woodshield Posts are designed for use in the Viticulture, Aquaculture, Equine and Agri industries. Made up of a core of untreated pine coated with six mm of plastic, they are available in 75 mm standard post and 113 mm row and end post sizes.

Preston said: “A key priority now is to let growers know about the recycling service, to build their appreciation of Sustaining Endeavour’s circular economy, and to win support for the products that contain the recycled resin.”

Preston’s work was supported through a Circular Economy Market Development Grant from Green Industries SA, co-investment from RPA, Netafim and Woodshield, local grower associations and regional supply stores.

Growers borrow a special re-coiling machine, provided by a Recycling Infrastructure Grant, from the local stores and coil and stack the driptube for transport to Adelaide.

Growers pay for freight, plus a $25 processing fee and $1 per kilometre of tube to transport the driptube to Adelaide.

RPA is able to recycle the material because of the commitments from Netafim and Woodshield for the purchase of minimum volumes.

It is this complex set of payments and subsidies from government, manufacturers and growers that makes Suataining Endeavour’s job of facilitation so important.

Without Preston drive and hard work there would be little alternative for thousands of kilometres of driptube but to end up in landfill or export.

Sustaining Endeavour tracks the amount of end-of-life driptube available for recycling, schedules consignments and issues local circular economy recycling certificates.

Preston said: “South Australians need to support the products derived from their own waste stream

“Circular Economy business models like this one help secure plastics recycling in South Australia and jobs in Australian manufacturing more broadly.”

313,"This week in banking news - RBA, IMT, and the circular economy","This week in banking news - RBA, IMT, and the circular economy

In this week’s banking recap, we look at Tuesday’s RBA decision, the circular economy, and the ways that loyalty to the big banks is costing Australians.

Following its meeting earlier this week, the Reserve Bank announced it will be keeping official interest rates at 1.00% for another month. But with the economy currently stalling, more rate cuts in the near future are pretty much a certainty at this point.

“The persistent downside risks to the global economy combined with subdued inflation have led a number of central banks to reduce interest rates this year and further monetary easing is widely expected,” said RBA Governor, Philip Lowe.

Are you paying a convenience tax on your home loan?

When you’ve held your savings with the one bank all your life, it might be convenient to turn to them when it comes time to take out a home loan, but is it really the best call? A recent report by ASIC found that while 60% of Aussie home buyers stick with their existing bank when signing up for a mortgage, their loyalty isn’t always rewarded with lower rates.

We aren’t just relying on our banks when it comes to home loans. They’re also first on the call sheet for Aussies looking to send money abroad or transfer between currencies. This comes via a new report from the ACCC, which found that opting for the big banks over alternative IMT providers is costing Australians hundreds of millions of dollars each year. With better deals available elsewhere, Aussies are being urged to shop around.

The circular economy: a way to save?

One of the big things holding people back from embracing sustainable living is that it’s not always cheap. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t ways to be kind to the planet and your wallet at the same time. This week, we took a look at the circular economy, and how borrowing, swapping, and buying pre-owned items make for a cost-effective way to help the environment.

On that note, if you’re looking to clear out your house of any unused goods, you might find you’re sitting on much more money than expected. According to Gumtree’s Second Hand Economy Report, the average Aussie household has around $5,300 worth of unused or unwanted items, adding up to a whopping $43 billion.

341,5 ways taking part in the circular economy could help you save money,"5 ways taking part in the circular economy could help you save money

Let’s face it, being eco-friendly sometimes feels like the more expensive option. Buying organic food, investing in renewables and choosing to buy ethical can set you back more than a few dollars. But being green doesn’t have to cost you the earth. In fact, there are lots of ways you can help make a difference to the planet and your savings account.

Embracing a whole new approach to what you use and what you throw away, could just help you stash more cash for a rainy day. Taking part in the circular economy is a great way to stop wasting not only the earth’s resources, but also your own hard earned money.

But you might be wondering what the circular economy is? What does it entail? And how can it help save you money and help save the planet?

What is the circular economy?

Right now, like almost everyone else, you’re probably used to a more linear economy. In the linear economy items are made, used and then disposed of.

The circular economy tries to do better by eliminating waste; in a circular economy items are made, used, mended when they break, reused and recycled into something else, after which the whole process can start again.



It really is as simple as that, reusing, mending and recycling. Plus throw borrowing and sharing into the mix, and you’re that much closer to reaching your savings goals!

Here’s a few tips on how you can live life in less of a straight line and start giving circles more love:



One simple way to join the circular economy and save money is by borrowing things you only use once. For example, instead of buying an expensive suit or dress to wear once at a wedding or other special occasion, why not think about hiring one.

Hiring a one-off outfit isn’t just a great way to reduce waste, it’s also a pretty shrewd way for the financially savvy to keep on trend and save money. One website we looked at had the option to rent a $320 dress for $89, saving you $231 and space in your closet on an item of clothing that chances are you won’t wear again.

Other ways to save money by borrowing is to join your local library. You can easily drop between $20 to $50 on a new book, whereas borrowing from the library shouldn’t cost you a cent. Plus the return deadline that comes with borrowing could spur you on to finish it!

Of course borrowing isn’t just limited to books and clothing. Since 2013 tool libraries have been popping up in different states across Australia, to champion a more sustainable way of living. All you have to do is pay an annual membership fee and you can borrow anything from a set of spanners to a sewing machine.

Another way to cut your costs and contribute to the circular economy is to fix what you already own. If your favourite shirt starts coming away at the seams don’t give up on it! Mend what you have, you could even set aside one evening each week to take care of all your repairs, whether it be sewing a button back on or sewing up a hole in your pants seam.

If you’re not too confident with sewing then check out a tutorial online or take your items in need of repair to your local alterations specialist.

This goes for other household items too; if you have an appliance or piece of furniture that’s busted, don’t drop money on a new one! Find your nearest Repair Cafe and see if someone can help you bring it back to life for free.

Repair Cafes are becoming more and more popular in Australia, they are run by volunteers and usually open a couple of times a month. Bring your broken item along for help fixing it, you could even gain some hands on knowledge for how to repair it next time!

3. Sell it on or swap it for something else

If you’re really not too keen on keeping an item of clothing or you have an old bicycle you no longer have space for then think about selling it on, instead of throwing it away.

Some good options for selling on your shirts, shoes, DVDs, kitchen appliances, white goods and other household items are:
• eBay - you can list up to 40 items for free on eBay. The website does take a small cut if you sell something, but you’ll still make some cash.
• Facebook Marketplace - Facebook’s digital marketplace is a great place to make a quick buck on furniture or appliances that you need to shift
• Gumtree - it’s a great site for listing larger items, such as fridges and vacuum cleaners with the option for the buyer to pick up, at no extra cost to you.
• Try out the app Carousell - it’s simple to use and you can advertise anything from furniture to fashion accessories, and give the buyer the option to pick up.
• Join your local buy, swap and sell page on Facebook. This way you can interact with people in your area who might be in need of that one piece of furniture you’re keen to get rid of. Or if there isn’t a buy, swap and sell page for your area, think about starting one yourself!
• Find out about suitcase rummages near you and make some quick cash out of all the clothes, shoes and accessories you no longer want.

You often won’t get back what you paid for something, but you’ll free up space and make a little bit of cash in the process. Plus selling it on means another person can save money on a brand new item, and save the planet by giving your unwanted goods more love.

RELATED ARTICLE: Unhappy with your bank? Here are some ethical options

While selling on can raise a bit of cash, buying pre-loved can also save you a lot of money. You can find some pretty unusual items in thrift stores or vintage shops, and remember if something doesn’t quite fit you could also have it altered by an alterations specialist. Not only will you have a totally unique item to wear, but you’ll most likely spend a lot less than you would on buying something first-hand.

Online marketplaces and buy, swap and sell websites are also a good place to save hundreds of dollars on white goods such as washing machines and fridges and necessary items such as vacuum cleaners. A good tip to remember is that sellers sometimes put larger items on for next-to-nothing if they are moving and have to get rid of them by a certain date.

If you acquire big ticket items such as these from online marketplaces, you’re not only saving yourself a lot of money, you’re also saving an item from being sent unnecessarily to landfill!

Talking of rubbish sent to landfill, it’s common knowledge by now that disposable containers, such as throwaway coffee cups, plastic straws and cutlery are bad for the environment. They can’t be recycled and our landfills are overflowing with them!

Investing in a reusable cup will not only reduce your waste but might also get you a sweet discount. A number of cafes offer money off when you BYO cup. Just think you could be saving 50c on your daily morning coffee, which over the course of a week really adds up! Check out the Responsible Cafes website to find out what cafes offer a discount, or ask your regular if they give money off for bringing your own.

You could even think bigger! Think about bringing reusable containers for all your takeaway food. The website Trashless Takeaway lists cafes, restaurants, bulk whole food stores, delicatessens and butchers that accept reusable containers, it even tells you which ones give you a discount when you BYO.

Or if you want to save money on takeaways full stop, think about preparing your weekly lunches at the weekend. Set aside some time on a Sunday to cook your meals for the week. Not only will you be saving the planet by reusing your own container, but you’ll also be saving a lot on pricey cafe food.

372,What is a circular economy and how will it affect me?,"The introduction of a circular economy policy in Victoria will open new business opportunities for Ballarat and change the way consumers purchase goods, according to one of the region's waste management leaders. Grampians Central West Waste and Resource Recovery Group chief executive La Vergne Lehmann said the policy would 'profoundly' change aspects of the economy, including business decisions and consumer choices. ""If we impact the way business operates we will impact the way people operate within that economy as well and that is the consumer,"" she said. The Victorian Government is currently developing a draft of the policy to be released later this year that will guide the way Victoria thinks about waste and resource recovery. A workshop will be held at the Lucas Community Hub on Monday from 1pm to 5pm for members of the Ballarat community to have their say on actions to deliver the policy in the next five years. The term 'circular economy' refers to a closed loop system where products do not go to landfill. Instead products are used, repaired, reused, re-manufactured or recycled. In a circular economy people minimise waste and make the most of resources, hence reducing impacts on the environment and increasing the value people obtain from goods and services. Products are designed so they are durable and can be readily repaired, reused and recycled at the end of their lives. Business models will encourage efficient product use, like sharing products between multiple users, or supplying services that include maintenance, repair and disposal. It will find new ways to use materials more efficiently and avoid waste in all stages of making. Ms Lehmann said small scale circular economies were already running in Ballarat through community initiatives like Boomerang Bags and Repair Cafe. ""The Boomerang Bags is a great example of a small scale circular economy where essentially you are using a waste product to be a more permanent solution to a plastic bag that would ordinarily have been thrown out,"" she said. ""Repair Cafes are a great example of a circular economy as well because they work to keep things in the system for a lot longer. The idea of more repair and mending are all significant aspects of a good circular economy model."" The tag line for the circular economy policy is 'creating more value and less waste'. With rapid population growth, the amount of materials used and thrown away is growing. Victoria will generate almost 60 per cent more waste by 2046 than it did in 2015, according to the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning. This will increase pressure on waste and resource recovery systems and, without further action, may require the establishment of new or expanded landfills. The circular economy policy is being created as Victoria's recycling challenges have worsened with China's decision to restrict the import of low quality mixed recyclables last year and the shut down of SKM Recycling.

City of Ballarat has said it would wait for the release of the circular economy policy before making further decisions on the establishment of a waste to energy plant in Ballarat. READ MORE: Hiatus for Ballarat's waste-to-energy plans The state government says shifting to a more circular economy will also grow the economy and increase jobs while avoiding waste. While Victoria has substantially improved its recycling system over time, much end-of-life material-over four million tonnes-is still sent to landfill each year. This effectively removes the potential value of those materials from the economy. Currently, 95 per cent of plastic packaging material value is lost after just one use. According to the state government, moving towards a more circular economy and improving how we use materials could: The circular economy policy will impact businesses and organisations, communities, local governments and households by encouraging improved material use. Ms Lehmann said the flow on effects of the policy would impact everyone. ""There will be opportunities for businesses to develop new business streams within their current business or completely new businesses will emerge,"" she said. ""There will be opportunities to create packaging with more recycled product in it and for businesses to create refillable and reusable products for example. So that means the way you purchase will be different as well.""

Australian Government analysis suggests 9.2 full time jobs are created for every 10,000 tonnes of material recycled compared to 2.8 jobs per 10,000 tonnes sent to landfill. For businesses, there will be new opportunities to create new products and offer services such as repair, refurbishment, or product leasing. The draft circular economy policy and action plan is expected to be released in September. Actions will be implemented from 2020 to 2030. Businesses, communities, councils and households have been asked to provide information on any barriers that are stopping improved material use, how these barriers could be overcome and what opportunities could be realised if they were removed as part of consultation.

411,Interface’s ReEntry® model: Creating a circular economy one carpet at a time,"Australia generates 67 million tonnes of waste a year. Out of that, 37 million tonnes get recycled and energy is recovered from 2 million tonnes. That amounts to a total of 58% of all general waste being recovered. Even though over the last ten years, the recovery rate has increased from 50% to 58%, waste generation overall continues to rise, driven largely by the growing population. With waste being responsible for approximately 2% of Australia’s greenhouse emissions, improving resource recovery capacity is one of the country’s biggest environmental priorities.

And whilst the wider move towards the circular economy requires a continuous collaboration between Australian governments, industries and businesses, some in the Australian construction and design market have embraced the importance of shifting their business models from ‘take, make and waste’ - to ‘make, use and reuse’.

Interface’s ReEntry® recycling model keeps waste from going into landfill by reusing reclaimed materials on an ongoing basis. Through the ReEntry program in Australia, reclaimed flooring from Interface can be used as flooring again – or separated into component materials to be reused into new flooring products. The model is Interface’s means to creating a circular economy as they look outside of waste-to-energy to keep emissions from entering the atmosphere and waste to landfill.

The ReEntry program is a key element of Interface’s Mission Zero goal, which now makes a key component to their new Climate Take Back® mission – their ambitious commitment to reversing global warming. ReEntry closes the loop of doing no harm and now removes the reliance of virgin raw materials and any materials of concern. Its aim is to keep carpet out of landfills - and reduce their carbon footprint. On the cusp of achieving their goal to eliminate any harm the company has on the environment, Interface has taken their dedication to lowering their carbon footprint to the next level by committing to take an industry leadership role in the reversal of global warming. And the ReEntry model is a big part of that commitment, keeping true to the circular economy model where value is maintained across its whole product life cycle.

Interface’s ReEntry program has been responsible for diverting material waste by maintaining responsibility for products, even at the end of their life cycle. Over the last 3 years alone, Interface has recycled or repurposed with a second life more than 9 million kilograms of postconsumer carpet worldwide. And because Interface look for opportunities to reduce and eliminate waste across all of their business, their waste reduction has resulted in a 92% decrease in waste to landfills from their carpet factories since 1996.

A great example of ReEntry's impact within the built environment is a recent commercial tower project in Canberra. Knight Frank and Real I.S. partnered with Interface to take all of their end of life carpet lifted and through the ReEntry program, diverting all 42,000-square-metres of old modular flooring. Helping them meet their sustainability goals by reducing the environmental impact of their refurbishment. The project saved the used carpet from going to landfill and prevented it from going to waste-to-energy, successfully managing material waste and creating an example circular economy.

Interface is poised to achieve their Mission Zero® goal to eliminate harm they may have on the environment. Today, all of the flooring products that they sell – carpet tile, luxury vinyl tile and rubber – are carbon neutral across their full life cycle. Their commitment to working on reversing global warming puts them at the helm of progressive businesses with sustainability driving both operations and their commercial success. Their array of flooring products is an excellent choice for partners who value style and quality but want to make a positive impact on the environment - and be an active participant in the circular economy Interface is creating.

Interface is a proud sponsor of the 2019 Sustainability Awards, to be held at The Star in Sydney on 7 November 2019. Learn more about Interface’s 100% carbon neutral flooring products here.",Australia,2019.10
499,Coffee brick homes and what else Australia’s circular economy is delivering,"It might sound like an adult version of Hansel and Gretel, but houses made out of coffee grinds could become a reality in the future.

Researchers from RMIT University in Melbourne have found a way to use coffee grinds in building materials.

The research group, led by senior lecturer in the School of Engineering Dr Srikanth Venkatesan, found that coffee grinds can replace 10 per cent of the sand in concrete mix.

Many concrete mixes are made up of 80 per cent sand, which is the third most used resource on the planet and supplies are struggling to keep up with demand. Extracting sand suitable for concrete can also damage fragile ecosystems.

The team has also developed and tested a “coffee brick”.

The research offers a circular economy solution for 156,000 kilograms of coffee ground waste every month produced by Melbourne cafes.

“The biggest challenge is ensuring the addition of spent coffee grinds does not lead to a reduction in strength of concrete, and this is the focus of further testing and development to make this product viable for use in real-world applications,” Dr Venkatesan said.

Dr Venkatesan had help on this project from Bachelor of Engineering (Civil and Infrastructure) (Honours) students Senura Kohombange and Anthony Abiad.

In other circular economy news, research undertaken by the Australian Council of Recycling by independent consultancy MRA highlights the potential of using waste in asphalt and road base.

It found that using recovered soft plastics, secondary glass cullet, and passenger tyre crumb in asphalt and/or road base in the nation’s 12 biggest current road projects, such as Sydney’s Westconnex and the Bruce Highway Upgrade in Queensland, Australia could at least double the amount of soft plastic that is currently domestically recycled, increase tyre recycling by 50 per cent, and help eradicate stockpiles of unused glass cullet in the country.

“The report looked at a current total of about 1000 kilometres of new road, and the results were very positive, ACOR chief executive officer Pete Shmigel said.

“In reality, some 10,000 kilometres of new roads are being constructed; so regular use of recycled material in roads according to a new standard would be a road-led recycling revolution for regional jobs and environmental benefits like greenhouse gas reduction.”",Australia,2019.10
515,Be part of Auckland’s first circular economy lab | Scoop News,"Be part of Auckland’s first circular economy lab

Auckland companies are invited to take part in XLabs, a new programme to help businesses build a more economically and environmentally sustainable future for themselves and the region.

XLabs is Auckland’s first circular economy lab, happening in February and March 2020 - a series of five one-day workshops and two events, that teaches businesses how to use circular economy principles to solve business challenges.

The circular economy designs out waste and pollution, keeps products and materials in use and regenerates natural systems, in contrast to the existing, unsustainable economic model of taking natural resources, making, using, then disposing of products.

Pam Ford, General Manager Economic Development for Auckland Tourism, Events and Economic Development (ATEED) says the organisation worked with the Sustainable Business Network last year to understand how Auckland could benefit from moving to a circular economy.

“We found Auckland could be $6-$8 billion better off, with much lower carbon emissions by 2030. We could create new economic opportunities for our businesses and our people, and enable a more resilient future for Auckland.”

“We also discovered a lack of awareness and understanding about how circular economy principles apply to business and industry. We found Auckland businesses need information, tools and skills to enable them to use these ideas to create new opportunities and reduce their reliance on finite resources.”

To help businesses, ATEED has joined forces with Auckland company Circularity, which will run XLabs early in 2020.

Louise Nash, Founder and CEO of Circularity, says XLabs combines cutting-edge thinking and proven real-world models from sustainability, technology and science.

“We seek Auckland businesses from the consumer goods, built environment, tourism and transport sectors to bring their teams and challenges to XLabs. They will be guided through our Circular by Design methodology to help them accelerate their innovation towards a more resilient future using six simple steps.”

The teams of three to six people from 25 participating companies will work alongside other businesses and leading circular thinking experts to build their knowledge, capability and skills.

“The teams will work with circular experts, scientists, technologists and creative minds. They will learn about resource-use, circular economy strategies, and work together to create innovative circular solutions for real-life business challenges Auckland companies are facing,” says Louise.

“We’ll share real-world examples of circular business models from around the world and expert knowledge in emerging technology, smart materials, waste, packaging, carbon emissions and regenerative practices.”

Participants will be supported through a process to ideate, prototype and market test circular economy innovations, then pitch their ideas to potential funders.

Companies interested in taking part can register their interest at xlabs.nz. Circularity will work with the companies to assess the challenges the businesses want to tackle and the opportunity XLabs can provide.

XLabs runs from February 28 to March 27 in the Hatchbox space, GridAKL / 12 Madden St, Wynyard Quarter, with a launch event on 27 February and a pitch event on 31 March. Registration costs $900 per person (+GST), with a small number of places available at a koha rate.",New Zealand,2019.10
516,Sight Magazine - Mars shows man the final frontier of circular economy,"Barren, dry and distant - welcome to Mars, where even the dust is poison. But space scientists say the Red Planet could show mankind how to reuse resources and preserve life on Earth.

A new exhibit which opened in London on Friday showcases some of the smart solutions that could make the red planet habitable, as humans target Mars with the same exploratory zeal they once reserved for the moon.

Food packaging could become fodder for 3-D printing; gardens might flourish underground and flooring be woven from bamboo.

""It's really thinking about remaking and reusing material over and over again,"" said Xavier de Kestelier, head of design technology and innovation at architecture practice HASSELL.

The event at London's Design Museum combines more than 200 exhibits and materials inspired by space exploration - from NASA to the European Space Agency - all of which offer ideas on repurposing dwindling resources and exploiting new technology.

""For example, the chairs are 3-D printed, they're not too heavy to bring with us,"" said de Kestelier. ""And we're using recycled plastics...that we might have from packaging material from food. The more they eat, the more they can print furniture.""

There have already been some two dozen Mars missions, seen as precursors for human exploration of a beyond-frozen planet about a third the size of Earth that orbits at least 35.8 million miles away.

Science has yet to discover why Mars, once a relatively warm, wet planet, evolved so differently from Earth into a mostly dry, desolate and cold world, devoid of life.

""How did Mars change into the way it is now? Are we looking at a future Earth?"" de Kestelier asked.

But the exhibit organisers hope the displays - all geared towards inhospitable Mars - could prolong Earth and be used to solve big problems like excess waste and water shortages.

The amount of materials the world uses has tripled since 1970 and could double again by 2050 unless action is taken, the United Nations estimates.

""One of the big ideas, for example, is mining on Earth involved a lot of water - we don't have a lot of it on Mars at all,"" Sanjeev Gupta, a professor at Imperial College London, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""We'd have to have dry mining and dry mining processing, so engineers are already thinking about how we might do that for the moon, and for Mars, and that will obviously feed back to Earth to save water.""

About a 10th of the nearly 93 billion tonnes of material used each year - minerals, metals, fossil fuels and biomass - are put back into service, said a report by Amsterdam-based social enterprise Circle Economy, an organisation that promotes the transition to a more sustainable economy.

""One would hope that getting people to think about Mars...that it brings home to us that actually our planet is very precious."" Gupta said.

""There is no plan B.""",Australia,2019.10
563,Circular Economy,"The existing economic model of taking natural resources, making, using, then disposing of products cannot be sustained.

Cities, enterprises and communities need a new economic model – the circular economy.

The circular economy designs out waste and pollution, keeps products and materials in use and regenerates natural systems. Transition to a circular economy requires fundamental redesign of existing systems, innovation and incorporation of new technology and smart materials.

Pam Ford, General Manager Economic Development for Auckland Tourism, Events and Economic Development (ATEED) says ATEED worked with the Sustainable Business Network to understand how Auckland could benefit from moving to a circular economy.

“Auckland could be $6-$8 billion better off, with much lower carbon emissions by 2030. We could create new economic opportunities for our businesses and our people, and enable a more resilient future for Auckland.""

590,LCA provides the evidence base for circular economy,"Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been the toolbox for sustainable products for decades, but it is fair to say that it hasn’t quite gained the level of popularity that could go with such a claim to fame. But maybe it doesn’t need to be popular.

Large brushstroke visions like cradle-to-cradle, bio-economy and circular economy should be the drivers of the necessary change, with LCA providing the evidence base making sure we choose optimal solutions and avoid unintended consequences. Without needing to know all the details, the broader sustainability community will benefit from understanding when and how LCA can be of use to them.

LCA is simply a framework to integrate environmental impacts over a full or partial value chain, ie, over several processes and entities, and across a range of impact categories. The framework is also applicable to social and economic aspects, and life cycle sustainability assessment covers all three simultaneously, but environmental LCA is the oldest and most common application. LCA is governed by international standards ISO 14040:2006 and ISO 14044:2006, with spin-off ‘single issue’ standards such as for carbon footprinting (ISO 14067:2018) and water footprinting (ISO 14046:2014).

En route to the circular economy (CE), LCA will make sure that circularity is accompanied by decreasing overall environmental impacts. Unfortunately, the two don’t always go hand in hand. Even when all energy will be derived from renewable sources — and this is still a while away — there will be a need to optimise energy efficiency and material use, for example, solar cells and batteries.

Very broadly speaking, there are two ways to use LCA. One is as a decision-making or design tool, for products or processes. By integrating a (full) range of supply chain processes and impact categories, LCA can help identify hotspots and trade-offs. For example, the use of recycled material may increase the weight of a product and thus increase transport requirements. LCA can balance the pros and cons and show whether there is net improvement.

The other way to use LCA is as an accounting tool. In this context, LCA generates values for standard metrics that can meaningfully be communicated business-to-business or business-to-consumer, such as carbon footprints (CFPs) or environmental product declarations (EPDs).

The Australian LCA Society (ALCAS) is a volunteer-run professional organisation promoting understanding and proper use of LCA as well as driving continuous professionalisation of this field. Our activities are centred around five main programs: Australian Life Cycle Inventory (AusLCI), EPD Australasia, professional certification of LCA practitioners, best practice guidance in impact assessment methodology and organisation of a biennial conference.

The freely available Australian Life Cycle Inventory (AusLCI) database (www.auslci.com.au) contains data on environmental inputs and emissions of a host of (intermediate) products. It helps you to understand the environmental impacts these products have, and enables you to calculate, for example, the carbon footprint of a cubic metre of 40 MPa concrete, or fossil fuel depletion associated with 1 kWh of electricity generated in NSW. AusLCI data are used in (NCOS) carbon neutral assessments, LCA tools for buildings and infrastructure, EPDs, etc.

EPDs are highly standardised and verified declarations of the environmental impacts associated with intermediate products. On the website epd-australasia.com you can find all the EPDs that are currently registered for the Australasian region. EPDs are used amongst others in green procurement and for credit points in Green Star ratings (www.gbca.org.au) and IS ratings (www.isca.org.au). An EPD can easily be used to create a Climate Declaration, or for a streamlined certification process as part of the Australian Government’s National Carbon Offset Standard (NCOS). ALCAS owns the EPD Australasia program together with our New Zealand counterparts LCANZ.

A certification program for LCA professionals (LCACP) is run together with the American Center for LCA (ACLCA). Certified professionals meet requirements regarding knowledge of and experience in performing LCA as well as being up to date on current developments. An ever-expanding list of certified practitioners can be found on the ALCAS website (www.alcas.asn.au).

A best-practice guide for life-cycle impact assessment in an Australian context was written by LCA experts to make the choice of metrics for environmental impacts easier. For climate change, we all know global warming potential in units of kg CO , but for other aspects such as air pollution or water scarcity, there is a bewildering number of methods available. The recommendations and associated impact factors are freely available on the ALCAS website and can be applied to single processes as well as life-cycle data.",Australia,2019.10
593,Rise of the circular economy: Ikea announces furniture buy-back scheme,"Flat-pack juggernaut Ikea is embracing the circular economy with a new national furniture buy-back scheme.

The buy-back service allows customers to return their old Ikea furniture in exchange for a gift voucher, the Swedish behemoth announced on Monday.

Returned products will be sold to a new owner and saved from landfill, Ikea said.

The launch follows a year-long trial during which more than 1600 furniture pieces were bought back from customers to find a new home.

The scheme is expected to save up to 15,000 pieces of furniture from landfill each year.

Ikea consumes a staggering one per cent of the world’s commercially produced wood each year, and one per cent of the world’s cotton.

The company has promised that by August 2020 it would source 100 per cent of wood, paper and cardboard from “more sustainable sources”.

By 2030, the company has committed to becoming “100 per cent circular and climate positive”.

“Improving the demand for recycling and promoting zero waste in Australia is our goal,” Ikea sustainability business partner Kate Ringvall said.

“This initiative goes beyond social responsibility and comes down to educating and helping Australians live a more sustainable life at home.”

Professor Michele John, the director of the Sustainable Engineering Group at Curtin University, praised the buy-back scheme as a “very good example of modern corporate stewardship and social responsibility”.

The scheme means that people wanting to dispose of old furniture will be less likely to resort to dumping it on the kerb, and can instead “hand it back to Ikea”, Professor John said.

Ikea’s buy-back program is an example of a concept gaining increasing traction among consumers and brands – that of the circular economy, or what industrial ecologists term a ‘closed loop’ production model.

A circular economy – as opposed to a linear economy – aims to end the continual use of Earth’s finite resources by eliminating waste.

A closed loop production model is one in which industrial production is made more efficient while the environmental impact is reduced.

“We can produce many things while also reducing the amount of waste we produce”, Professor John explained.

Closed loop production, or the circular economy, is the way of the future, Professor John said.

“We’ve got one planet, a growing population, and China and India chasing middle-class lives and production desires and consumption wants,” she said.

“As a result we’re going to have to get more efficient, with only one planet providing more resources for an increasing population and companies wanting to produce more and consume more.”

Fast fashion companies that churn out cheap, disposable clothes are facing increasing scrutiny over their environmental impact.

In Australia alone, residual fashion waste averages 2.25 million tonnes per year.

The solution is for consumers to return their old clothes directly to big fashion chains – rather than inundating op-shops and charity stores with clothing nobody wants – University of Technology Sydney fashion and textiles researcher Dr Mark Liu wrote in The Conversation last month.

Some fashion chains such as H&M, Uniqlo and Zara have already introduced collection boxes for old clothes in their stores, with H&M promising to donate 3 cents for every kilogram of returned clothing to recycling research.

“It is time to make corporations pay for their waste, fund research and change their business models,” Dr Liu said.

“If they continue to disregard their environmental responsibilities, citizens have the power to bury their stores in their waste.

“We can return our old clothes to fast fashion companies and change the industry, one garment at a time.”

Food, beverage and consumer goods manufacturers are being forced to reckon with the havoc plastic packaging has wreaked on the environment.

Last week multinational giant Unilever became the latest company to commit to curbing its plastic pollution, announcing it would halve the use of non-recycled “virgin” plastic in its products by 2025.

In April, Coca-Cola Amatil announced 70 per cent of its plastic bottles in Australia would be made entirely from recycled plastic by the end of the year.

Last year, Nestlé committed to making “100 per cent of its packaging recyclable or reusable by 2025, with a particular focus on avoiding plastic waste”",Australia,2019.10

“It is time to make corporations pay for their waste, fund research and change their business models,” Dr Liu said.

“If they continue to disregard their environmental responsibilities, citizens have the power to bury their stores in their waste.

“We can return our old clothes to fast fashion companies and change the industry, one garment at a time.”

Food, beverage and consumer goods manufacturers are being forced to reckon with the havoc plastic packaging has wreaked on the environment.

Last week multinational giant Unilever became the latest company to commit to curbing its plastic pollution, announcing it would halve the use of non-recycled “virgin” plastic in its products by 2025.

In April, Coca-Cola Amatil announced 70 per cent of its plastic bottles in Australia would be made entirely from recycled plastic by the end of the year.

Last year, Nestlé committed to making “100 per cent of its packaging recyclable or reusable by 2025, with a particular focus on avoiding plastic waste”",Australia,2019.10
596,NSW innovation network for circular economy,"A new innovation network launched by the NSW government will bring together government, industry and researchers in a drive to create a circular economy.

The Circular Economy Innovation Network, or NSW Circular, was launched by NSW Planning and Public Spaces Minister Rob Stokes this month.

NSW Circular will be hosted by the University of New South Wales and led by Professor Veena Sahajwalla, Director of the Centre for Sustainable Materials Research and Technology at the university.

The innovation network will be funded through the Office of the NSW Chief Scientist & Engineer and will work towards enhancing sustainability and creating a circular economy.

Through a series of workshops, it will bring together stakeholders across the industry, government, local councils, research organisations and the community.

Mr Stokes said there was need for manufacturing to evolve in the post-China Sword era.

“With China no longer accepting our recycled waste, our manufacturing industry must evolve,” he said.

“This is our chance to bring more jobs back to our own backyard, particularly in the Special Activation Precincts in regional NSW.”

On top of workshops for stakeholders, the network will also provide tools and resources to help solve problems, encourage innovation and deliver socio-economic benefits, such as employment.

There are currently three pilot projects underway to divert waste from landfills and create new supply chains to turn waste into materials for manufacturing and valuable products.

Professor Sahajwalla is looking forward to working with stakeholders to ensure that NSW leads the way in this area.

“By working with and bringing together the many groups wanting better waste and recycling outcomes, which importantly includes those involved in materials recycling science, we are creating new solutions and a circular economy where we reuse and keep materials in use for as long as possible,” she said in a statement.

Environment Minister Matt Kean said NSW Circular will complement other government initiatives, such as the Government’s 20-Year Waste Strategy and Plastics Plan.

“There is a lot of activity in this space, but to date it has lacked a degree of coordination and connectivity,” he said in a statement.

“This new network will help us develop the programs we need to increase recycling and create a circular economy.”

599,Ferrero sets big goals for circular economy - Food & Drink Business,"The Ferrero Group has announced a commitment to make all its packaging 100 per cent reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025.

In its tenth corporate social responsibility report, the company said it represented a focus on minimising the company’s environmental impact – through raw materials, production and logistics – along its entire value chain.

Ferrero has signed the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, which has the vision of a circular economy for plastics where no plastics become waste.

Ferrero Group executive chairman Giovanni Ferrero said: “Ferrero has always taken a responsible approach to delivering high-quality product experiences that positively contribute to both today and tomorrow’s society. This belief continues to drive us towards a responsible value chain by sourcing sustainably, producing sustainably and now by further strengthening our commitment to more sustainable packaging.”

Signing up to the New Plastics commitment will support the company’s acceleration to a circular economy, he said.

Ferrero will invest more in R&D and its Open Innovation departments to eliminate unnecessary plastic packaging, maximise the use of recycled materials and test new compostable packaging material with a focus on marine compostable solutions.

For plant waste recycling, it will partner with recyclers, national waste management systems and non-food companies and explore uses for difficult to recycle packaging materials.",Australia,2019.10
605,Nationwide campaign against burning rubbish launched | Scoop News,"Today, community groups throughout the country led by the Zero Waste Network have launched a national campaign against waste-to-energy incinerators. The centrepiece of this campaign is a petition to the Minister for the Environment David Parker requesting that he intervene and decline all new applications for incinerators in Aotearoa New Zealand.

“Now is the time for a national approach to this issue to make it clear that we don’t want waste dumps full of hazardous incinerator ash across the country. New Zealanders want a zero waste future, not a toxic waste landscape,” said Zero Waste Network Chairman, Marty Hoffart.

The campaign was initiated in response to increasing interest by international incineration corporate interests to set up shop here in New Zealand. At present, the group is aware of two proposals under consideration: one in Hokitika and the other in Huntly. Wellington City Council has included incineration as a potential replacement for its Southern Landfill, which is nearing the end of its useful life. There have also been discussions in the Kaipara region and New Plymouth.

The national Waste Levy Review conducted in 2017 showed that New Zealanders are producing significantly more waste than they did a decade ago. Furthermore, communities and local councils around the country are grappling with stockpiles of recycling that have resulted from restricted international markets for plastics, soft plastics, and contaminated paper and cardboard.

Mr Hoffart believes that, “The answer to these problems is not burning rubbish. Rather, we need to phase out the types of materials we can’t recycle by introducing mandatory product stewardship schemes like those currently being considered by the Government. We need to commit to real recycling and support local councils to move towards a circular economy.”

“Waste-to-energy incineration actually turns ordinary household rubbish into toxic waste that must be disposed of in a special hazardous waste landfill. As an example, the West Coast produces only about 4,000 tonnes of waste each year. But importing waste to feed the proposed Hokitika incinerator would leave the town with more than 10,000 tonnes of toxic ash and sludge which would need to be carefully managed for generations in a hazardous waste landfill.”

Incineration proponents claim that today’s incinerators are much cleaner and more efficient than their highly polluting forebears, which are currently being shut down because of the newly discovered health risks. But even the latest incinerators still pollute, albeit within national standards.

“The difficulty is that most of the pollutants coming out of an incinerator, including heavy metals and dioxins, persist in the environment,” says Hoffart. “While exhaust gases may be within limits when they leave the smokestack, they fall on the land and wash into our waterways where they can accumulate to toxic levels and enter our food chain risking a myriad of damaging health and environmental effects.

But probably the most damning indictment on incinerators is that most of the gas leaving the smokestack is in the form of climate changing carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is currently Public Enemy Number One as we face the threat of climate change, including predicted sea level rise, food chain disruption and mass extinction across the planet.

Jacqui Forbes, Kaihautū Matua for Māori zero waste organisation Para Kore, says “Incineration is like creating a landfill in the sky. We need to look after Ranginui and Papatūānuku by returning to closed loop living where rubbish is not part of the design.”

“Our responsibility is to protect our environment for future generations. The children of tomorrow are relying on us to do the right thing and mitigate climate change to the greatest possible extent. We need to grab hold of every opportunity we possibly can to eliminate sources of greenhouse gas emissions - incineration is one of those sources. It just doesn’t make sense to burn waste.”

For Rubbish Trip zero waste campaigner Hannah Blumhardt, it’s all about resources. “Every day, we meet with young people to talk about the importance of conserving our precious resources. We live on a finite planet and just can’t continue on the linear trajectory we’ve been on for the past hundred years,” she says. “Our planet just cannot sustain this. We need to redesign our systems and many of our products to reflect circular economy principles and ensure everything we do protects and regenerates the Earth. Incineration is completely at odds with these principles.”

“Governments and businesses across the globe are increasingly endorsing the concept of a circular economy, which aims to replace our old linear ‘take-make-waste’ approach to production with a new paradigm that designs out waste. This new system would copy the way nature does things with the aim of keeping biological and non-biological resources circulating in the economy through endlessly cycles. For example, old products and broken components are returned to producers for remanufacture. Added to this, packaging is infinitely recyclable or reusable, and organic waste is composted to grow the next generation of food. In contrast, waste-to-energy incinerators are a dinosaur technology that locks the linear system in place by creating an incentive to keep wasting.”

While circular systems are much better for the environment, they’re also good for people by creating many more employment opportunities than linear systems. For example, international zero waste think tank RREUSE has calculated that in addition to destroying valuable resources, incinerators also destroy jobs. Their research has found that for every one job at an incinerator, a community recycling centre creates 36 jobs and reuse activities create 296 jobs.

“This is why we are seeking a clear directive from central government that waste-to-energy is off the table,” says Hoffart. “And we’re asking New Zealanders to join us by adding their signature to our petition.” The petition can be found at https://our.actionstation.org.nz/petitions/regeneration-not-incineration

725,The circular economy: How plastic could be used to create more sustainable homewares,"Discarded designer dresses, plastic signs and glass may not be what comes to mind when you think of stylish homewares, but all that could be set to change.

World-first recycling technologies recently unveiled at the University of New South Wales are turning common waste – such as old clothing and textiles, plastics and glass – into tiles, ceramics and panels that can be used for building products, furniture and other applications.

It could be the stylish solution to the pressing problem of dealing with our recyclable waste, according to professor Veena Sahajwalla, director of UNSW’s SMaRT Centre.

“It allows us to partner with designers, to have end-users basically saying ‘Right, this thing has now served its purpose in this form … can we bring it back to life again in a whole new form?’ You can do that,” she said.

“Waste glass and textiles … and plastics, can actually be brought to life as part of beautiful furniture,” she said. “It’s a far more sustainable approach than the ‘take, make, waste’ system, which results in the loss of resources and ever-growing landfill.”

At the microfactory, launched by the federal Environment Minister Sussan Ley last week, waste can be turned into 3D printer filaments used to create “beautiful niche solutions”.

Such solutions include tables and artworks created with the help of stylist and artist Emma Elizabeth and industrial designer Anuj Dhawan, from NSW Circular Economy Innovation Network.

The homewares, on display at Mirvac’s recently opened Marrick & Co apartment complex in Sydney’s inner west, include a blue-hued dining table created with ceramic tiles made from glass and a designer dress. As well as occasional tables made from corflute posters — used to promote university events — that were destined for landfill.

Ms Elizabeth said it was incredible to see what the SMaRT Centre technology could do with discarded items.

“This is the way of the future, an exciting future,” she said. “We’re in slow fashion movement, we’re in a slow food movement, and I feel like we’re definitely in a slow design movement now.”

Professor Sahajwalla said the collaboration was a chance to show that beautiful products, with brilliant properties, could be made from recycled materials.

She added the collaboration with Marrick & Co demonstrated how a circular economy that aims at eliminating waste and promoting the continual use and re-use of resources could deliver economic, social and environmental benefits.

It shows the huge potential and benefit of recycling for the housing and design industries, said Mirvac’s general manager of design, marketing and sales, Diana Sarcasmo.

“As the first One Planet Living community in NSW, creating Marrick & Co has been an exercise in looking at sustainability from all perspectives,” said Ms Sarcasmo. “Pairing Professor Sahajwalla and her SMaRT Centre team, and Emma Elizabeth continues our efforts to drive behavioural change by highlighting the ways in which materials can be given a second life.”

With buildings responsible for around 25 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions globally, Ms Sarcasmo said, Mirvac is aiming to recycle all waste from its developments by 2030

“At Marrick & Co we have succeeded in diverting 95 per cent of waste through clever repurposing of materials; however, the remaining 5 per cent is the most difficult,” she said.

“If we can find a way to reduce waste and create something useful and beautiful in the process, then we are one step closer to a planet-friendly existence.”",Australia,2019.10

823,War on waste: Australia's first 'circular economy' coffee cup,"As the backlash to single-use products grows, BYO reusable coffee cups have become popular among busy office workers looking to enjoy a takeaway cup of coffee without adding more waste to landfill.

But in a coffee-loving nation, the flaw lies in the simple fact that not everyone has a cup on hand when a caffeine craving hits.

That’s a problem The Cup eXchange co-founder Marty Rowell set out to solve using a system that’s growing in popularity around the world: The circular economy.

What is the circular economy?

As climate change pushes environmental concerns to the fore, the concept of the circular economy is gaining support among brands and consumers.

A circular economy – as opposed to a linear economy – aims to end the continual use of Earth’s finite resources by eliminating waste.

Under a circular (or ‘closed loop’) model, production is made more efficient while the environmental impact is reduced.

“We can produce many things while also reducing the amount of waste we produce”, Professor Michele John, the director of the Sustainable Engineering Group at Curtin University, explained.

“If we’re producing any waste we look at how can we include that waste back in the original production system.’’

Mr Rowell and his brother Jeremy hit upon the idea for a circular-economy coffee cup after watching the ABC’s popular War on Waste program in 2017.

To illustrate the sheer volume of waste going into landfill every day, the show demonstrated that the 50,000 single-use coffee cups disposed of every 30 minutes in Australia were enough to fill an entire Melbourne tram.

“My brother Jeremy and I really looked at that and saw it was a big problem, but the call to action was to bring a container in and demand a 30 cent discount,” Mr Rowell said.

“And we thought that wasn’t really fair on the small businesses … It’s not their fault that there’s no better solution than these paper cups.

“So we thought about it hard and said, well, how do we stop the waste by having a better system?”

The brothers dismissed the idea of simply “trying to make a better cup”, as that “doesn’t solve convenience for the user”.

“If you’ve got a personal reusable cup you’ve got all of the inconvenience problems with it – you’ve still got to wash it, still got to carry it, still got to remember it,” Mr Rowell said.

Instead, they decided to treat takeaway cups as an “inventory management problem”.

Rather than “making more stuff” they would “treat the world as our warehouse”, Mr Rowell said.

The result was The Cup eXchange, Australia’s first smartphone-enabled circular-economy coffee cup subscription service, which launched last month at cafes in Melbourne’s Rialto precinct.

A ‘library of cups’: How it works

The Cup Exchange works like a library system – a customer becomes a member and is able to borrow from a “library of cups” when ordering their daily coffee, Mr Rowell explained.

Each cup has a unique identifier – a QR code – that is scanned before it leaves the cafe and linked directly to the customer’s account.

When they’re finished with their coffee, the customer leaves the cup in one of a number of dedicated deposit boxes in the vicinity, where it is collected, washed and returned to the cafe.

The system is environmentally friendly and economic: “The cost-per-use comes right down and is much, much lower than a paper cup”, Mr Rowell said.

“What we’re doing is tracking products, and whoever the custodian is as that point in time,” he explained.",Australia,2019.11
830,What goes around,"A Downer crew resurfaces Queenstown Airport's apron, using TonerPave made from recycled glass bottles and toner ink. Photo: Supplied Businesses are transitioning to a new model with a lighter tread, writes Sara Walton.

How can we change our thinking on consumption, faced with dwindling natural resources and increasing costs to dispose of waste? A couple of weeks ago this question was at the heart of a Sustainable Business Network workshop at the Otago Business School.

Several business representatives came to talk about their activities in this area. It was interesting to hear from a variety of businesses thinking about the full life cycle of their products. Asking questions such as: what are the impacts of all of the parts of the products that I sell? What parts can be used for other purposes?

For example, Fuji Xerox is moving towards a circular economy model with a re-use and recycle rate of 99.5% for returned equipment, which is accredited through the Ministry for the Environment product stewardship scheme. Under the Government's proposed new product stewardship scheme, this kind of thinking and practice is set to expand.

The proposal focuses on six priority products: tyres, electrical and electronics (e-waste), refridgerants, agrichemicals, farm plastics and packaging. It involves moving to a circular way of using resources across the economy.

For example, the waste toner from the Fuji Xerox take-back scheme is used in a low-carbon asphalt road surface called TonerPave, which is purported to reduce the carbon emissions of roads.

While regulation might be an initiator for product stewardship, it also makes sense from an economic point of view.

Owning the materials that can then be re-used in the manufacturing process may make signficiant economic sense - especially in a resource depleted planet (or one where resource extraction becomes more expensive).

It recognises that our world is not resource abundant nor do we have unlimited capacity for dumping our waste materials.

McDonough and Braungart, founders of the cradle-to-cradle approach, say that it is about recognising the limits of the current industrial economy. We must develop a better understanding of how we are increasingly coming up against these limits when operating as business-as-usual (BAU) - which is to say, a linear take-make-waste system. BAU relies on infinite raw resources and unlimited space for disposal. We know that this is not the case and the increasing costs of such thinking are starting to create influence in business decisions.

Designing products to be dis-assembled at the end of their life is part of the cradle-to-cradle or circular economy system. At the end of a product's life the parts either end up going back into new products or are such that they can be returned and broken down in the biological system. This helps reduces waste (and the costs of such) and reduces the need for extraction or production of raw resources.

In the circular economy model the company continues to own the products and leases them to consumers on a pay as you use system. As such, the products can then be returned to the company at the end of life for dis-assembly and the appropriate parts are then re-used.

It sounds deceivingly simple but to move to a system in Aotearoa New Zealand will require significant change across all sectors of the economy.

Practices are changing and research across all disciplines - materials processing, supply-chain, legal aspects - is happening. Through working together it is hoped an understanding will be developed of how circularity can operate in our socio-cultural context.

Like most change for sustainability it will likely involve a series of transitions with all players coming to the table to redesign systems that will operate within our planetary limits - thus a sustainable transition in the making.

908,Money being 'wasted' amid plastic pollution,"Tens of millions of dollars that could be used to prevent plastic pollution are being misused, Port Stephens MP Kate Washington says. Ms Washington, the NSW Shadow Minister for the Environment, said this money should be used to invest in the so-called ""circular economy"". Amid a worldwide crisis in recycling, there's a strong push in Australia for governments to invest in this type of economy. It would mean the waste collected in yellow-lidded bins in the Hunter and elsewhere would be recycled and reused in Australia, rather than being sent overseas - often to Third World countries. At present, councils don't know precisely where this type of waste ends up because they don't track it. Greenpeace says much of it ends up in landfill, being burned, or dumped into waterways and the ocean. Ms Washington said the NSW government's notorious waste levy should be used to help ""create the circular economy"". She said the NSW government collects about $750 million to $800 million a year through its waste levy, which is applied to landfill material by weight and levied against councils which pass the cost on to ratepayers. The aim of the levy was to discourage landfill and support recycling programs. But Ms Washington said the levy had become ""a general tax, with at least two-thirds going straight into consolidated revenue"". ""This money is being wasted. The whole system is a mess."" The NSW Government has allocated $802 million over nine years for its Waste Less, Recycle More program. Ms Washington said industry could create a system that gets ""close to that circular economy"". ""We've got the technology, the industry is ready, willing and able, we just need some support from government."" The circular economy would ensure Australia does its part to reduce plastic pollution, amid rising global concern about Western countries using the Third World as a garbage tip. This concern prompted Prime Minister Scott Morrison to state recently that some of Australia's plastic exported to Asia ends up in rivers and the Pacific Ocean. Mr Morrison said only 12 per cent of Australia's plastic waste was recycled, mostly overseas. Greenpeace said only 9 per cent of plastic waste was recycled worldwide, 12 per cent was incinerated and 79 per cent was dumped in landfills or the environment. A meeting of federal, state and territory environment ministers was held in Adelaide last Friday. The ministers set a timetable for the progressive phase out of ""problem waste exports"" from July next year. They also committed to waste reduction targets under a new National Waste Action Plan. The ministers agreed that plastic, paper, glass and tyre waste that had not been processed into ""value-added material"" should be subject to the export ban. The ban applies to waste glass by July next year, mixed plastics by July 2021, whole tyres by December 2021 and mixed paper and cardboard by no later than June 2022. The plan has been criticised as destined to fail unless it is backed by hundreds of millions of dollars in funding and adequate legislation. The Victorian government said it was investing $135 million in the sector. It wants the federal government to contribute, but federal environment minister Sussan Ley said the ban would ""not be achieved through ""government grants and too much regulation"". There are concerns that a recycling industry in Australia won't be viable because of competition with cheaper imports and lower wages in places such as Asia. The Waste Management and Resource Recovery Association of Australia said a ban on waste exports should be matched ""with a ban on packaging imports"". The association questioned how a ban on waste exports could work without a requirement that producers ""take responsibility for products they design and create throughout their lifecycles"". ""For the export ban to work, producers of goods, particularly packaging such as paper and mixed plastics - which is the main focus of the ban - need to contribute to the costs of managing their materials."" The Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation told the ABC that ""we live in a capitalist society"" and the recycling market was ""driven by supply and demand"". The ministers have vowed to boost demand through ""significant increases"" in governments buying recycled materials for building and infrastructure projects.",Australia,2019.11
43,WSC visioning prompts statutory recognition for circular economy precinct,"A great example is in Perth, where this year the City of Nedlands Local Planning Scheme

 No 3 gazetted a new Special Control Area for the Subiaco Wastewater Treatment Plant Strategic Water Resource Precinct.

This is the first Perth metropolitan wastewater treatment plant to be provided with statutory protection via a Special Control Area designation in a planning scheme. Plus, the buffer zone around it is the first to be recognised as a strategic resource precinct (aka Buffertopia)—a concept first developed by Water Corporation and incorporated into the State Planning Strategy in 2014.

A strategic resource precinct is a key step in establishing the role of wastewater treatment plants in a circular economy. It defines an area around a wastewater treatment plant that will contain a concentration of infrastructure, land uses and services that support the reuse of resources that can be created from wastewater—recycled water, biogas, biosolids and nutrients etc. The strategic resource precinct signals the opportunity for co-location for land uses and industries that can provide inputs, use outputs, or both, to support this upcycling of wastewater into resources.
