3,"Molewa fought for cleaner, greener world for all","Waste is money. This was one of the many mantras of the late environmental affairs minister Dr Edna Molewa - a leader who was committed to ensuring that jobs were created through recycling, alongside creating a cleaner and greener world for all.

As South Africa prepares to celebrate National Marine Week, which is celebrated annually during the second week of October, one is reminded of Molewa's efforts, and commitment, to ensuring our oceans and the land-based sources of litter that ends up in the oceans, is eradicated.

Such was her desire to ensure that all South Africans knew of the wonders of the oceans, that she ensured the department hosted its National Marine Week celebrations in Limpopo two years ago.

Marine pollution is one of the biggest challenges we face today and threatens fragile ecosystems. Because of this, the oceans and our marine environment have been the focus of a number of campaigns.

Earlier this month, SA joined many coastal countries in commemorating the International Coastal Clean-up Day. The day rallied together communities with the common goal of collecting and documenting marine litter around global coastlines.

According to the World Bank, SA produces 54425 tonnes of municipal solid waste daily, and this is the 15th highest rate in the world.

South Africa has shown commitment to addressing the marine litter and micro-plastics challenge through several forums, with Molewa announcing earlier this year that consultations were being held with the cosmetics industry to phase out micro-plastics.

In July 2017, the G20 group of countries, of which South Africa is a member, adopted an Action Plan on Marine Litter. In December 2017, at the margins of the 3rd UN Environment Assembly, South Africa endorsed the UN's Clean Seas Campaign, which exists as a platform for governments to engage the general public, civil society and the private sector to find solutions to the plastic litter challenge.

SA is also participating in the Western Indian Ocean Strategic Action Programme (WIO-SAP) on land-based sources of marine pollution, under the Nairobi Convention, for the protection, management and development of the marine and coastal and environment of the Western Indian Ocean region.",South Africa,2018.09
27,Rwanda partners with Yale University to advance environmental conservation,"The Government of Rwanda and Yale University have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to foster greater cooperation and collaboration in the areas of education and research in sustainable development and environmental protection and conservation.

The signing of the agreement took place during a visit by Minister for Environment, Vincent Biruta, to the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Affairs.

Minister Biruta was joined by the CEO of the Rwanda Green Fund, Hubert Ruzibiza, and the Acting Director of the Centre of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural Resource Management at the University of Rwanda, Beth Kaplin.

As part of their visit, the delegation met with students and staff of the university who have conducted research on the circular economy in Rwanda. They also toured the Gentner Research Group on Air Quality Monitoring as well as the Centre for Engineering, Innovation and Design.

At the agreement signing, President of Yale University, Peter Salovey, spoke about the importance of forging new partnerships with African nations and institutions.

“I am pleased to be signing this agreement with the Ministry of Environment of Rwanda on projects to do with industrial ecology. We are proud to be a collaborator. When I became President, I announced that Yale would have an Africa Initiative.

“In the early years, this has included bringing many more students to Yale from Africa and figuring out ways for domestic students to have educational and research experiences or internships in Africa. But the most important part of the initiative is these kinds of research collaborations, and we are delighted to be entering into one with Rwanda today.”

Under the agreement, Yale University and Rwanda, through the Ministry of Environment and University of Rwanda, will pursue opportunities for collaborative teaching and research in support of the Sustainable Development Goals.

The mutually beneficial collaboration will foster an exchange of resources and capacity building to support the missions of the partners. It will also provide additional new opportunities for Yale students to conduct work and research in Rwanda, and for Rwandan academics to visit Yale University.

“I am very excited to be part of building this partnership. In Rwanda, we are facing environmental and climate challenges and so everything we do in response must be supported by research. Partnerships like the one we have signed are especially critical when addressing complex global challenges. Policy makers and academics must work together to ensure that the latest research is informing the strategies and laws we are creating and implementing. That’s why we are here today,” said Minister Biruta.

The visit by the Rwandan delegation concluded with a public lecture delivered by Biruta at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. Students and faculty engaged with the minister on the impact of climate change in Rwanda and the process undertaken by the world’s nations to reach the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. Concluding his remarks, the minister encouraged Yale students to visit Rwanda to conduct research and support the country’s socio-economic transformation and environmental protection efforts.",Rwanda,2018.09
78,Tomra Sorting Recycling Creates Managerial Role To Strengthen Focus On New Plastics Economy,"New appointment reflects TOMRA’s full commitment to the ambitious vision for a circular economy

TOMRA Sorting Recycling has promoted Business Development Engineer László Székely to the newly-created post of Head of New Plastics Economy. This initiative reinforces TOMRA’s commitment to the aims of the New Plastics Economy (NPE) and will steer progress towards objectives which are differentiated from the company’s other business development activities.

TOMRA’s New Plastics Economy team will work to encourage the sorting and recycling of post-consumer plastics such as Polyolefins and Styrenes, to change the widespread practice of burning such materials or sending them to landfill. TOMRA is also committed to working with packaging producers to help make packaging more widely recyclable; to reduce the reliance of packaging production on raw materials; and to contribute to the drive for upgrading post-consumer plastics, so that there is greater use of recycled rather than virgin materials.

László Székely joined TOMRA brand TITECH (rebranded later as TOMRA Sorting Recycling) in 2012 after completing studies in waste management and contaminated site treatment at the Technische Universität Dresden, in Germany. Serving as a Business Development Engineer, László was TOMRA’s segment-champion for applications capable of sorting glass from different waste streams, with joint responsibility for development of the AUTOSORT Laser glass-sorting unit.

He was also closely involved in the planning and construction of the first two automatic MSW (municipal solid waste) sorting plants in Hungary, and assisted two big brands with upgrading for post-consumer plastics (Polypropylene). Since 2017 László has been involved in projects focusing on post-consumer polyolefin packaging, PET trays and working with packaging and converter businesses.

László Székely said: “I am delighted that my dedication and expertise have been recognized in this way because progress towards the New Plastic Economy is so important. I was really excited when I joined TOMRA, because I admired the company for being a technical pioneer and market leader, and seven years later I am still hugely excited by this company’s innovative spirit.”

TOMRA’s NPE work will also involve, at a senior level, Jürgen Priesters, Vice President, Head of Business Development Recycling, and Business Development Engineer Charlotte Glassneck.

The vision of the New Plastics Economy, which applies principles of the circular economy, was created by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation with three ambitions: to create an effective after-use plastics economy by improving the economics and uptake of recycling, reuse and controlled biodegradation for targeted applications; to drastically reduce leakage of plastics into natural systems (especially the ocean) and other negative impacts; and to decouple plastics from fossil feedstocks. Although these aims were launched in 2016 as a three-year initiative, they have built a momentum which will inspire action for many years to come.",South Africa,2018.10
326,"Marine waste a pressing issue, few resolutions in sight","Plastic has become the “ubiquitous workhorse material” of the modern economy, combining unrivalled functional properties with low cost, and its use has increased twentyfold in the past half-century, according to circular economy advocacy charity the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

However, the rapid rise in demand for plastic, owing to its low-cost appeal, has also developed into its biggest drawback – easy disposability and single use. Vast volumes of single-use plastic serve a brief purpose before being disposed of, after which the plastic either ends up at landfill sites or, eventually, in the world’s oceans.

More recently, large masses of ocean plastic have begun to either wash up on beaches or become increasingly visible in the five ocean gyres – areas in the middle of oceans where currents sweep and gather debris.

Currently, there are about 700-million tons of plastic in the world’s oceans, and this volume is being added to daily, says nonprofit marine wildlife conservation organisation Sea Shepherd Conservation Society CEO and founder Captain Paul Watson.

According to global trash removal and marine environmental advocacy initiative 4ocean, a garbage truck filled with plastic waste is being dumped into the ocean every minute. Yearly, 630 000 t of trash ends up in oceans, much of it comprising plastic, the organisation adds.

The situation is so dire that the Ellen MacArthur Foundation claims that, at the current rate of plastic accumulation in the oceans, by 2050, the plastic in the world’s oceans will weigh more than all the fish.

“Plastic is a greater threat to sea life than oil spills,” says Watson, explaining that oil degrades in sunlight and in environments where there are bacteria, but plastic does not degrade.

Describing his early attempts to bring attention to the plastics dilemma, Watson says that people thought he was being ridiculous when he wrote about the pollution caused by plastic in the 1980s. “Now, at last, these concerns are being taken seriously.”

Sea Shepherd crews sail across the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans every year, during which plastic spotting has become a daily and regular occurrence. Plastic is a major threat to life in the ocean, says Watson. “That is why Sea Shepherd is working to recycle the fishing gear that we retrieve during our antipoaching campaigns and why our volunteers worldwide are cleaning beaches and retrieving plastic nets and garbage from the bottom of the sea.”

Marine life often dies as a direct result of plastic waste, states Watson. “From getting strangled by six-pack plastic holders to starving to death with a stomach full of plastic – whales, turtles, birds and many other marine species have been documented to have died as a direct result of plastics pollution.”

Watson says the dilemma of such large volumes of plastic in the ocean is exacerbated by the global population increasing and more people adopting the “plastic convenience culture”, in which virtually every human being uses plastic materials daily, directly and indirectly.

However, 4ocean cites poor trash management by the waste management departments of many countries worldwide. The initiative says that, in Ghana, for instance, the waste management department is capable of collecting only 60% of the waste generated daily for disposal to landfills. “The rest is dumped in open spaces, in surface drains and into bodies of water. This is a prime example of how, even when we properly dispose of trash, inappropriate containers . . . can still find [their] way, whether directly or indirectly, into our oceans.”

International multimedia news agency Sky News has also thrown its hat into the awareness campaign with its Sky Ocean Rescue initiative. According to this initiative, everyone is responsible for plastic in the ocean. “From 2014 to 2015, there was a 43% increase in the number of plastic bottles washing up on UK beaches.”

Floating plastic acts as a magnet for pesticides, flame retardants and other chemicals found in the ocean. These chemicals are known to disrupt human hormones and cause cancer. Plastic also contains phthalates, often found in glue, and bisphenol-A, which is also used to make DVDs.

This is where a key health risk comes into play. Plastic breaks into smaller pieces as waves and the sun make it brittle. Once it turns into small chunks, it is mistaken for food by fish. Subsequently, microplastics become lodged in the fish, working their way into the animals’ chemical composition and affecting their hormones. This has a knock-on effect for humans, who consume seafood and, thus, ultimately, microplastics-laden fish.

To mitigate the situation, Sea Shepherd is engaged in microplastics research. Scientists on board Sea Shepherd vessels have found links between the disruption of the reproductive system of fin whales in the Sea of Cortez, off the coast of Mexico, and the plastic chemical accumulation in the endocrine system of these whales, owing to the ingestion of microplastics. “Like heavy metals, these chemicals accumulate in the body,” says Watson, adding that the long-term effects are not fully known and humans are being affected in ways not yet imaginable. “All marine life is ingesting high levels of microplastics; therefore, so are humans consuming seafood.”

Sea Shepherd also has its Clean Waves campaign, through which the organisation is establishing plastics management solutions in remote atolls in the Pacific Ocean, starting with Fanning Island, in Kiribati.

Reducing the volumes of plastic ending up in the oceans will primarily require not using single-use plastics. Single-use plastic items range from thin grocery packets, disposable plastic cups and food and beverage containers to cotton earbuds and straws, besides other items.

Watson says there is no easy way through which humanity can shift towards a more environment-friendly coexistence with nature, but points out that it is not impossible. “People used to buy groceries in the 1940s (with carriers other than single-use plastic bags) and managed. Food should be sold in glass containers and recycled paper.”

Watson explains that moving away from single-use plastic is a matter of will. “Take your own bags and containers to the store – do not use single-use plastics.” He also advises that something as simple as carrying a personal water bottle and a coffee cup could go a long way towards reducing single-use plastic products.

Further, he enthuses that society should increasingly support companies that are moving away from plastics and spread the word to others who might still be uncommitted. “With demand, the market will adapt and more plastic-free products will become available.”

In line with a reduction in the demand for single-use plastic products, many also point to the need for a much more intensive programme of recycling of plastic.

Sky Ocean Rescue states that, in the UK, about 36-million plastic bottles are bought every day, but fewer than 50% end up being recycled.

A key prospect of the Sky Ocean Rescue campaign is lobbying for the introduction of a deposit return scheme. “There are already 35 schemes in place worldwide. One in Norway raised recycling rates to 96%,” according to the campaign.

Meanwhile, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) urges consumers to adopt a few simple and basic philosophies to “turn the tide on plastic”. Its first is to adopt the increased use of durable shopping bags to replace single-use plastic bags.

The second is to reduce the use and demand for single-use disposable coffee cups. The WWF cites the South African Coffee Club’s statistics, which indicate that coffee consumption and the coffee business in general have grown dramatically in South Africa. Ten years ago, there were fewer than 20 roasteries compared with more than 100 currently. In this regard, the WWF advises consumers to carry a personal reusable coffee cup with them instead.

Single-use plastic straws are also a major issue, as are plastic water bottles. But the WWF says many retailers are switching to more ecofriendly options, such as reusable straws made from glass, steel, and even bamboo. In terms of water containers, the WWF also urges people to switch to a reusable glass water bottle.

Another major bugbear for the WWF is the use of earbuds with plastic sticks, but the organisation says these can be substituted with paper-based buds, which are available on the market and simply require consumers to encourage retailers to stock them. The plastic sticks used in lollipops pose a similar problem, and can be replaced with paper sticks.

Therefore, to move successfully away from the various forms of single-use plastic items requires buy-in throughout the supply and consumption chain, from the design of products to the manufacturing, distribution and transport of goods to retailers and to the end consumer.

A greater volume of alternative, easier-to-recycle or biodegradable products will go a long way towards making it easier for consumers to choose more environment-friendly products, as well as making it easier to either reuse such items or to dispose of them.",South Africa,2018.10
386,Circular economy presents opportunities for Africa,"The circular economy, as a reformative system, presents significant opportunities for Africa to deliver on more inclusive economic growth, which includes job opportunities and the positive environmental practices that are in dire need for sustainable growth, says waste management company Interwaste business development and marketing director Kate Stubbs.

The ideology of the circular economy is that the linear model of make, use and dispose must be abandoned, and that a more sustainable ecocycle can be achieved through the long-term design and planning of products, maintenance, repair, reuse, remanufacturing, refurbishing, recycling and upcycling, she tells Engineering News. 



Although the adoption of the circular economy is still in its infancy in South Africa, she points out, there are success stories, where, through innovation, new business streams and even new industries – such as the waste picker sector, reprocessing and waste-to-energy industries – are being introduced.

“For example, while recycling offers many environmental benefits, its ability to create jobs cannot be emphasised enough. In fact, the waste picker sector is growing and plays a key role in South Africa’s recycling strategy.”

Stubbs notes that waste pickers are reported to earn between about R290 and R770 a week from the waste they collect, demonstrating the potential of waste to create an income stream for individuals.

Further, as recycling becomes more of a national priority, it presents more opportunities for waste pickers to work individually to support their families or potentially to organise themselves into small businesses. She highlights that, with the correct resources, waste pickers can employ other members of their communities, thereby creating employment opportunities through the informal sector.

Moreover, the drive to divert waste from landfill has directly resulted in waste disposers and/or waste management companies merging into reprocessing industries, with significant focus being placed on reuse, recycle and repurpose. “This is leading to manufacturers of products and packaging, as well as resellers, rethinking the way their products and processes are designed.”

Stubbs cites the commitment by local retailers in South Africa to move away from non-degradable and plastic packaging as a recent example of this.

Further, she states that the circular economy model correlates directly with the ethos on which Interwaste has been built and continues to influence the company’s investments and growth strategy.

The company’s aim remains to lead the sustainable preservation of the environment by delivering viable waste solutions that are socially conscious, forward thinking, cost effective and compliant with the King IV corporate governance code. The King Report on Corporate Governance is a booklet of guidelines for the governance structures and operation of companies in South Africa.

“However, we do need to instill a complete culture change in how we approach and treat resources versus waste to avoid potential crises and ensure we build towards a resilient and sustainable future in South Africa. It is an ongoing journey that needs to be driven by everyone, every day,” she concludes.",South Africa,2018.11
419,Green growth is good for business,"Africa is developing quickly, and we need to ensure this growth can be sustained for generations to come. That can only be achieved if it is green, clean and climate resilient.

That is why the Government of Rwanda has organised the Africa Green Growth Forum – to bring the private sector together with policy makers and investors to advance green growth and raise awareness about the potential of a new model of economic development.

It is a good platform to share best practices so that, together, we can foster investment and innovation in green growth.

The Africa Green Growth Forum also aims to encourage private sector investment in green growth, improve the understanding and use of finance as a tool for climate resilience, and provide a platform for partners to engage and build relationships that accelerate the green growth agenda.

Some of the highlights of the AGGF include the Investment Forum and events on e-mobility, the Circular Economy, and innovative finance for green growth.

We are also hosting 20 companies from across the continent for an exhibition on green technologies.

As part of the Forum, we will host a concert on Friday evening to award champions of green growth in the fields of industry, local government, media and youth to showcase some of Rwanda’s leading green initiatives.

If you’re in business today, you need to be thinking about green growth. By incorporating green growth into your business model, you can be more efficient in your operations, increase productivity and have a positive impact on the environment.

It drives up profits that can be sustained for the long term. This is important for both investors and employees. We must remember that green growth doesn’t mean limited growth, but rather smart growth. By taking advantage of new business models that use resources to their full potential, eliminate waste and pollution and support nature to regenerate, we can create new and higher paying jobs.

This kind of smart and high quality growth takes an intergenerational view of prosperity. We need to be thinking about profit in the next five years as well as what’s good for Africa over the next 500 years. And the process we are making is positive!

Across the continent, government and business are working to integrate the principles of green growth into their economic growth policies, and their daily operations.

The private sector is investing in new technologies to drive clean energy development, exploring the Circular Economy and investing in rehabilitating our ecosystems.

Still today, a major challenge we face in achieving green growth is simple awareness. That’s why the Forum is such an important event.

Once leaders from all sectors of society understand the benefits of green growth, they are quick to adopt it. We need to keep raising awareness and explaining why green growth is an investment worth making.

We also need to break the myth that green growth is more expensive than traditional development. Sometimes the upfront investment may be higher, but in the long-run, green growth is a cost saver.

In Rwanda, we are investing in green growth in a number of ways, with a focus on clean energy, waste management and green urbanisation.

Currently, renewable energy accounts for approximately 70% of Rwanda’s energy mix. Rwanda recently established a state-of-the-art e-waste recycling facility.

We are also working with partners to build a Green City Pilot in Kigali, and to green the country’s six secondary cities.

Indeed, the designs for Rwanda’s single largest infrastructure investment, the Bugesera International Airport, were recently updated to improve its green credentials and we are confident it will be one of the greenest airports on the continent.

These are just some of the tangible activities taking place in Rwanda, and there are many more examples across the continent that we can be proud of.

508,Rwanda to host inaugural Africa Green Growth Forum,"Over 1,000 participants including investors, policy makers and financial specialists from across the continent are expected to gather at the forum to share experiences in green growth and climate resilient development.

Kigali, Rwanda. Rwanda will host a five-day forum on Africa Green Growth from November 26 to 30, 2018 at the Kigali Convention Centre and at sites around the country.

Over 1,000 participants including investors, policy makers and financial specialists from across the continent are expected to gather at the forum to share experiences in green growth and climate resilient development.

The forum themed, ‘For a Green and Climate Resilient Africa,’ will shine a light on the importance of sustainable economic transformation and signal green growth as a priority for Africa.

It will encourage private sector investment in green growth, improve the understanding and use of finance as a tool for climate resilience, build partnerships between stakeholders working in Africa’s green growth sector and provide a platform for partners to engage in and build relationships that accelerate the green growth agenda.

12,Inside Rwanda's enduring battle to eliminate e-waste,"Samples of e-waste rolls on display at a past e-waste management event in Kigali. Sam Ngendahimana.

Government’s decision to recycle obsolete and old electronic equipment had offered hope that the country was on course to getting rid of electronic waste.

However, latest figures show that the country’s sole e-waste recycling plant has managed to collect 700 tonnes of e-waste since it was leased out to EnviroServe Rwanda, a subsidiary of EnviroServe Dubai.

The plant has so far managed to mitigate 870 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions while 434 tonnes of e-waste have been dismantled and recycled as at the end of October this year.

Yet, it is estimated that Rwanda generates 10,000 tonnes of e-waste every year, which is way higher than what the recycling plant collects.

To handle more capacity, the firm has a plan to expand its operations and open another facility.

Coletha Ruhamya, the Director General of Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA) says they are putting in place a comprehensive policy for waste management to cub the rise of electronic waste.

“The e-waste is increasing and our plan is to have a legal framework in place. We had developed a policy for e-waste but we were advised to have a policy for integrated waste management to enable private investments to come in to help us,” she explained.

The Government entered a lease agreement with EnviroServe Rwanda, a private e-waste electronic recycling company. The firm will run the Bugesera based recycling facility for a period of 10 years.

Company officials say they have been able to set up three collection centres, which will enable them to collect more waste.

“In our first year of operation, we have established three drop-off points (collection centres), even though the plan is to have 30 across the country. This has enabled us to collect more than 700 tonnes of e-waste,” Olivier Mbera, the General Manager of EnviroServe Rwanda, told The New Times.

The company also says that it has the ability to record and separate old equipment from the equipment that can be refurbished.

“We mainly refurbish computers, printers – the equipment that can be reused in schools. What we are doing is good for circular economy because we are promoting the lifespan of the equipment,” Mbera said.

He added that the company has sold nearly 1,300 refurbished computers to schools at a low cost.

The firm also dismantles and recycles e-waste for the purposes of removing hazardous elements as well as recovering valuable components like steel, aluminium, copper and plastic.

The Government says that electronics waste is no longer a burden in Rwanda. This is a big statement for a country that had previously grappled with electronics waste.

An EnviroServe study, which was conducted prior to beginning operations, shows that one institution used to spend between Rwf2 million and Rwf5 million to rent a warehouse to store electronic waste.

Individuals, on the other hand, would throw the waste which would end up in landfills, which posed environmental and hazardous health threats.

There is no study that has been conducted in Rwanda to ascertain the level of health threats posed by e-waste that ends up in landfills can pose. However, these studies have been conducted elsewhere.

Mubera points out that Ghana where such a study was conducted showed that toxic chemicals and metal leads from electronics waste posed cancer threats, among other diseases.

Globally the amount of e-waste continues to grow, while too little is recycled, according to the United Nations.

In 2016, for example, the world generated 44.7 million metric tonnes of e-waste and only 20 per cent was recycled through appropriate channels, the UN’s Global E-waste Monitor 2017 shows.

As efforts to provide solutions to e-waste take shape, EnviroServe says the economic value from the waste is also unmatched, disclosing a few statistics to prove how much they are earning from valuable components.

Valuable components, including copper, steel and aluminium are extracted from the waste, compressed and are sold to processing companies. A tiny portion of other valuables is exported.

“For example, for steel, we sell it to steel industries like Imana Steel as a raw material which is used to produce iron bars. Actually the quality of steel we get from waste is very good,” Mbera notes.

It is not only steel that is sold locally. High density plastic and aluminium also have a market domestically, while copper is exported.

The company says it processes 10 tonnes of steel per month. Plastic processed and sold is at 25 per cent of steel, while less than 1 per cent and 2 per cent of aluminium and copper is sold, respectively.

Steel costs Rwf300 per kilogramme. This means 10 tonnes could generate Rwf3 million per month. Aluminium, on the other hand, costs Rwf800 and a kilogramme goes for over Rwf3,000.",Rwanda,2018.12
137,"#BizTrends2019: Single-use plastic, circular economy, ethical supply chains and climate action to drive retail in 2019","More than ever before in 2018 we saw sustainability playing a major role in shaping trends in the retail sector. Sustainability took the centre stage in Cape Town as it came close to being the first large city in the world to run out of water. We also saw the rise of global commitments on packaging improvements as well as phasing out of single-use plastic.

Did you know that the Collins Dictionary named ‘single-use’ as one of its words of last year? The popularity of the phrase – which refers to plastic items which are used once before being discarded – is a representation of how sustainability has permeated public consciousness. And it gives me hope that we are moving in the right direction in addressing the challenge of plastic pollution.We at Woolies announced the bold commitment and vision of zero packaging waste to landfill last year in our drive to do our part in reducing plastic pollution. Part of this commitment is to ensure that all our plastic packaging is either reusable or recyclable by 2022 and to phase out plastic shopping bags from our stores by 2020.Phasing out plastic shopping bags is no easy task if you want to ensure that your customers still have a great convenient shopping experience. We also decided that rather than just shifting from a plastic bag to a paper or compostable bag – which each, unfortunately, have their own environmental challenges – we would rather partner with our customers and encourage them to use reusable bags.This requires a substantial behaviour change so we embarked on a trial in the Cape area late last year which included removing plastic shopping bags from one store. We had a few nervous moments, but I am pleased to confirm that now a couple of months into the trial it is all going well. We hope to roll out more plastic bag free stores in 2019 as we move closer to towards our 2020 commitment.So what else in 2019?I expect the recent focus on plastic is just the tip of the iceberg and will gain even more momentum over the next year. And it won’t just be plastic for 2019.I believe that South Africans are becoming more and more aware of their environment and the impact of their consumerism so will be posing more questions to retailers. Questions like, where does my food and clothes come from? Who made them? Where were they grown or made? How much water and pesticides were used? Were the farm and factory workers paid a living wage? How far have these products travelled to get to me?Ethical supply chains and sustainable sourcing will continue to drive retailer behaviour. Last year we launched the first beauty and food products made with RSPO certified palm oil in South Africa. This was a significant milestone for us and was testament to the dedication of our various teams who worked tirelessly to shift whole supply chains to enable this.Palm oil has received at lot of media attention recently, and rightly so. We believe that responsible sourcing is the right approach, and do date at least 50% of our palm oil is RSPO certified. Taking this approach means that we and our suppliers can help drive the demand for the production and supply of sustainably sourced palm oil throughout the sector and into the communities where it is produced.Whether it is sourcing sustainable palm oil, cocoa, coffee, sugar or cotton we know that retailers can’t do it on their own so another key trend is collaboration. Be it partnering with other retailers, suppliers, communities or environmental organisations we have to all work together with our customers to ensure that real sustainable change can happen throughout the supply chain.Alongside ‘single-use’, another phrase that I expect to hear more of in the next year is ‘circular economy’.Circular economy forces product designers and businesses to re-think how they do things in order to retain as much value of products and materials as possible and minimise waste. Circular economy thinking is turning the manufacturing and design industry on its head and will lead us into a new age of innovation with the aim of creating products with the end of life in mind.The demand for food is also increasing due to the growth of the world’s population, at the same time climate change is making farming even more challenging than previous years. So even more than ever there will be pressure to improve farming efficiencies, adapt farming principles to be more resilient and redistribute food to reduce food waste.These are, however, more than simply trends for a new year. They are concepts that are helping to shape and mould modern retail. The winners will be those that are able to successfully integrate sustainability seamlessly into their business.",South Africa,2019.01
262,Questions on bio-bricks grown from urine answered,"The recent story on the first bio-brick grown from human urine made headlines around the world. It was picked up by 142 news outlets in 23 countries, with a potential media reach of 248 million people in the first five days after the announcement was made. Project leader Dr Dyllon Randall’s subsequent public lecture late last year answered common questions about the project.

Randall, together with his master’s student Suzanne Lambert and honours student Vukheta Mukhari, have been swamped by media queries since the story broke on 24 October, 2018.

The lecture, attended by students and staff, international visitors and representatives from NGOs, government and industry, was held under the banner of UCT’s Future Water Institute. Randall is both a core member of the institute and a senior lecturer in water quality in the Department of Civil Engineering.

Here are Randall’s answers to common questions about the bio-bricks:

So what’s the big deal about bio-bricks?

“With sustainability in mind, we need a paradigm shift. We should be rethinking waste [like urine], focusing on resource recovery. We need sustainable processes that reduce carbon emissions. We need to recycle nutrients and other material. Resource recovery is important for a sustainable future. Projects like these help to create paradigm shifts through education.”

How does this process reflect a circular economy?

“We need alternatives for kiln-baked bricks. Modern sanitation is inefficient at processing waste, especially when three key ingredients for inorganic fertiliser – nitrogen, potassium and phosphorous – can be retrieved from urine. Once is not enough. Our current economy is linear: we take, we make, we dispose. The circular economy focuses on making, using and recycling.”

“The language we use when we refer to waste is important. We say wastewater. Why not call it a resource? Why say sewage treatment plant? Why not call it a nutrient recovery plant? We say urine is a waste [product]. Why not say urine is liquid gold? Changing our language helps create paradigm shifts. In addition, we need to address multiple sustainability goals. For example, this project addresses clean water and sanitation; industry, innovation and infrastructure; sustainable cities and communities as well as responsible consumption and production. And indirectly, probably multiple others.

“Yes, they do, because the by-product is ammonia, but only for a short while. The bio-bricks lose their ammonia smell after drying at room temperature for a day or two, and are safe to use and handle.”

Would this process work at scale?

“I think it would. There’s a company called BioMason that grows 2 500 bricks a day using synthetic urea, which is commercially viable at scale.”

Can animal urine be used?

“If it’s fresh – not older than 48 hours – or you would have lost most of the urea.”

If you remove urine from the sewage works, are you just creating another problem?

“No. Research has shown that diverting urine out of that waste stream means that the nutrient load is substantially reduced and, as a result, wastewater treatment plants generally will become net energy producers.”

Is there a medium other than sand that can be used to grow bio-bricks?

“Yes. The only reason we used sand – which I don’t think is sustainable – was to see if the process would work. So, ultimately, we should be using waste products for the medium such as fly ash or sludge; anything we can glue together would work, in theory.”

How long does it take to make the brick?

“It depends on how strong you want it to be. The maximum length of time we’ve left it [in the mould] has been eight days. To optimise the process, you’d want to reduce that time. That will require further research.”

Does the health status of the urine matter?

“We haven’t really gone into that, but the other beauty of this process is that adding calcium hydroxide to the urine and operating at a really high pH kills harmful pathogens and bacteria. But we have to test that further.”

In sharing the news of Randall’s work, some journalists have made several errors in their reporting.

Randall elaborates: “Firstly, we produced a bio-brick from urine, not a conventional brick. Other practitioners have previously made mud bricks using human urine. We use bacteria and a process called Microbial Induced Calcium Carbonate Precipitation (MICP) to create our bio-bricks.

“Secondly, BioMason uses synthetic urea for their process, not synthetic urine. Finally, this is not the world’s strongest ‘brick’ – it still requires further testing to improve the strength.”",South Africa,2019.01
281,SA must tackle sustainable development goals,"JOHANNESBURG – Christmas came and went and so has the New Year. Suddenly we are back to our routine. Our sense for the year has just begun. The big agenda for South Africa is the national elections. This will usher in the sixth administration. A historic milestone has just unfolded in the Democratic Republic of the Congo which, for the first time in six decades, enjoyed what is adjudged to be its first democratic election. The end-of-year celebrations seem to have been long for those on the twilight and fringes of society. The Tshwane Municipality had not collected rubbish for at least three weeks. This was from just before Christmas to January 8. The streets by then were literally over-flowing from the waste and wrappers of the silly period. By the way, most people in the Christian world are born in September and this affirms the significance of the festivities and the joyous indulgence. But it's not about births that this article is about. It's about people who maraud the streets for survival from the waste.

Over the three weeks they were deprived of what had become their regular means of livelihoods. No sooner were the bins out in the streets than they were being opened. The contents were meticulously searched for plastic, metal and paper. In the light of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), the Goalkeepers Summit and the Global Citizens Concert held here in December, this was a sad reminder of the challenges that have to be overcome, in particular as relating to SDG 1 on eliminating poverty and Goal 2 on hunger.

But there was also SDG 11 on sustainable cities and communities, as well as SDG 8 on decent work.

One wondered, with these multitudes of men dragging massive loads to centres of recycling, whether reducing inequality, Goal 10, is within reach.

The grime and grease on their bodies shining against the blistering summer sun suggested that clean water, Goal 6, could not be part of their worry as they strove to just tackle in ways too unsatisfactory to deal with Goal 2 on zero hunger.

But the task these men are tackling through heart-rending non-choices they have to make is to teach us that a circular economy is possible, an economy of abundance wherein they cannot and need not live a life of misery. What it takes is responsible production and consumption, namely Goal 12.

The toil of these men, now joined by a few women, begs the question whether it's not possible to make their back-breaking work lighter by designing rubbish bins in such a way that they could access paper, plastic and metal much more easily.

When an entrepreneurial idea emerges to help these challenges, it should be such that it does not displace those who are living in the twilight and margins of society.

Yet when the poor mingle with cars with their unwieldy burdens right in the centre of the road, one can hardly surmise that they are on the margins.

These kings of the road are showing a different story about South Africa, one that suggests a society that should tackle the Sustainable Development Goals.

298,"SA gearing up for green economy, CTICC summit hears","Cape Town – South Africa’s vision of transitioning towards a green economy has been embraced at the highest political level, said Environmental Affairs Minister Nomvula Mokonyane. She gave the key address at the opening of the 3rd Partnership for Action on the Green Economy (Page) Ministerial Conference at the Cape Town International Convention Centre yesterday. A moment of silence was observed for Mokonyane’s predecessor, Edna Molewa, who died in September after illness, aged 61. Mokonyane said the two-day conference would focus on advancing inclusivity and sustainability economies in robust discussion that addressed practical solutions and reversing the inequalities of the past. “This platform supports countries and regions to put sustainability at the heart of economic policies and practices to advance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

‘‘This is an important conference given that it follows the conclusion of the international climate change talks in Poland, where the Paris Agreement Work Programme was adopted, setting out the Rules of implementation.”

Mokonyane said the natural capital dialogue at the conference should contribute to the formulation of the post-2020 Agenda for Nature.

Page was launched in 2013 as a response to the call at the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) to support countries wishing to embark on greener and more inclusive growth trajectories.

About 500 delegates, including 17 ministers or deputy ministers of environment, finance, business, science and technology and development were to participate in robust discussions on tools and strategies for shaping greener economies.

A series of parallel sessions with high-level speakers would tackle topics on green finance, strategies and policies for a green economy, social and economic inclusion, sustainable consumption and production, and the circular economy.

International Labour Organisation director-general Guy Ryder said the organisation was proud to celebrate the start of its centenary year with the Page conference.

“Page responds to very important and pressing international ambitions that we all share.

‘‘It provides processes and interventions to tackle three dimensions of sustainability.

‘‘Page makes it possible for us to say we can sustain decent jobs, sustain improved living standards, while at the same time protecting the planet,” he said.

Finland’s Minister of Environment, Kimmo Tiilikainen, said the conference was successful in bringing together the different expertise in sustainable development.

“In Finland, we have noted that a small percentage of our plastics was ending up in our landfills, while over 90% of our plastics and aluminium is being recycled.

‘‘We need the world governments to show leadership and engagement of green and inclusive economic policies and methods. Page is a great example of successful partnership between the Northern and Southern hemispheres,” he said.",South Africa,2019.01

 A series of parallel sessions on Friday will see a focus on finance, strategies, inclusion and the circular economy. Among the moderators for the sessions is Cecilia Njenga, head of the UN Environment Office in South Africa.

The conference will look at economic and social inclusion allied to creating sustainable economies as part of efforts to help nations reframe economic policies to focus on sustainability and to foster economic growth.

Mokonyane will welcome over 500 delegates to the Page conference. Page assists in coordinating UN action on green economy and to assist countries in achieving and monitoring the Sustainable Development goals.

“Hosting the Page Conference will advance the agenda of inclusive growth, and the adoption of a low carbon and climate resilient economy, domestically and on the African continent,” Mokonyane said in a statement on Tuesday.

South Africa is hosting the 3rd Page Ministerial Conference, following conferences in Dubai in 2014 and Berlin in 2017. The conference will see around 500 delegates, including 17 ministers/deputy ministers of environment, finance, business, science and technology and development.

634,"White paper: Circular economy, your digital path","The current levels of resource consumption and exploitation, in addition to expected increases in population, will likely lead to an irreversible environmental stress for the planet. This will impact the availability of food, drinkable water, clean air, and many other resources, with dramatic consequences for citizens, businesses and governments. Obtaining and paying for raw materials will become increasingly difficult (as they become progressively scarce), migrations and conflict will increase, and diseases will flourish. Our current mass production model, designed to meet a globalised economy, is a factor of increasing pressure on resources, with adverse effects on health and biodiversity.

The time is right for a circular economy, where products are designed to minimise reliance on non-renewable resources, taking a holistic view of both the supply and value chain, to maximise the lifespan of a product.

This white paper examines the principles of the circular economy and technological trends that could enable it. The study proposes a digital model for the circular economy and details some technology-driven business opportunities. Moreover, it reviews the necessary conditions for the circular economy's implementation, including challenges and potential preclusions, and reflects on its governance. Finally, as digitalisation is considered a springboard for the circular economy, the paper describes the technological building blocks, which could make it a reality.",South Africa,2019.02

According to SA Fashion Week's latest annual report, the wholesale turnover at The Fashion Agent, an agency for independent designers, increased by 10% over the past 12 months.

In the Eastern Cape the first commercial cashmere production facility uses the fine hair of the indigenous iMbuzi goats, farmed by 500 small-scale farmers, many of them women. The owner of the Ivili Loboya, Vuyo Mahlati, told Farmers Weekly that she has seen strong interest in her cashmere. ""Our research shows that Africa's growing middle class is discerning in its fabric choices, looking for natural fibres where possible.""

The manufacturing of more and better local fabric is crucial. Nicole Luther, designer and co-owner of Lunar, says access to good fabric is a problem. ""There are very few mills left in SA so we struggle to source locally produced, high-quality natural fabrics.

325,Durban shop's innovative way of achieving zero waste,"Durban shop's innovative way of achieving zero waste

Durban - If all the groceries in your cupboard are in containers that are refillable, all you need to do is take them to the shop when you need more. Wouldn’t that make life easier than having a waste bin filled with plastics and non-recyclable wraps that will end up on the beaches, harming the environment? The fight against plastic pollution inspired five friends to take matters into their own hands. The danger of plastic pollution is receiving more international attention, and many outlets in and around Durban promote no-waste shopping. One such zero-waste shop is House of Bravo, which launches at Florida Fields, in Durban’s Florida Road. The centre is celebrating its opening with a launch-week from Monday until Friday.

“We are encouraging other retailers to go back to the way grandmothers and grandfathers used to shop, where they would get a steak wrapped in brown paper and milk delivered in glass bottles.

“This is not new, we are just going back to how things used to be,” said Leane Hendrick, House of Bravo’s owner.

Another is Good Source in Hillcrest, west of Durban. This supermarket aims to transform shopping. It stocks almost everything you can get, but it is no ordinary supermarket.

Its wooden shelves are not packed with attractive colours of fancy packaging. Instead, there are rows and rows of glass containers.

“All the products are stored in glass and customers are not given plastic bags but help themselves using their own containers, or they can buy compostable or reusable ones at the shop,” said Kim Drennan, the co-founder and co-owner of the store.

Shoppers are encouraged to bring their own containers and bags.

Drennan co-owns the shop with five friends: Jenny Thomson, Nicole Benders, Phillip Botha and Charlene Udal.

It has been open for six months, after much research and planning on how to turn an idea into a reality.

“We had a vision of seeing the world being free from plastic pollution and, of course, everything had to start from us.

“We started eliminating use of plastics in our homes before we could coax our consumers into living without plastic,” said Drennan.

It has not been an easy journey.

They told Independent on Saturday that their challenge was to get suppliers willing to supply goods without plastic packaging.

“Every supplier we approach, we sit down with them and explain to them how we need the goods to be packaged. We only use cotton sack, glass bottle, stainless steel tanks, wax wraps and muslin bags.

“We tell them about our refill system and take our containers to them to be refilled and transported back to us. We do not want any packaged product, especially those in plastic. Some suppliers happily get on board with how we do things,” said Drennan.

One of the biggest packaging companies in South Africa, Unilever, said it remained firmly committed to ensuring that all of its packaging will be 100% recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025, but Adam Preola, Unilever sustainability manager, said it aimed to beat this target.

“It is inspiring to hear that, more and more, people around the world are taking action against climate change and plastic pollution.

“Transformational change is needed in governance, policy and designing for a circular economy, but it is also the collective action and small behaviour changes, such as taking our own shopping bags to the supermarket and using a reusable water bottle, that will make a tremendous difference,” said Preola.",South Africa,2019.04
552,"Waste is ‘worth gold’, city dwellers told in push to reuse resources","Faced with the twin challenges of rapid population growth and rising carbon emissions, cities have no choice but to “go circular” and cut waste while using fewer resources, researchers and policymakers said on Thursday.

The amount of materials the world uses has tripled since 1970 and could double again by 2050 if no action is taken, the United Nations estimates.

From Rotterdam to Singapore, cities are looking at how they can shift to a circular economy, which means reusing products, parts and materials, producing no waste and pollution, and using fewer new resources and energy.

Read: Living off garbage at the bottom of world’s most unequal nation

“If we don’t change the way we produce and consume, we can continue dreaming about eradicating poverty and climate change,” said Janez Potocnik, co-chair of the UN’s International Resource Panel and former EU Commissioner for the Environment.

“The circular economy is the oldest concept on Earth: in nature nothing is lost and everything has its purpose,” Potocnik said at the Urban Future conference in Oslo, Norway’s capital.

Miranda Schnitger, cities project lead at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which was set up by record-breaking British sailor Ellen MacArthur, said the circular economy “has to start with cities”.

According to the United Nations, cities will host two-thirds of the world’s people by 2050.

“Cities are already consuming 75% of global natural resources, account for 60-80% of carbon emissions – and that’s before urban populations grow further,” Schnitger said.

She cited office space – “60% of which is unused during the daytime” – and traffic as two aspects of city life that are particularly wasteful and polluting.

“Ninety percent of air pollution in cities comes from vehicle emissions, but most of the time there’s one person in the car, not five, and the car is parked,” she said.

“So you have to ask, how do we use that resource more efficiently?”

Some cities are advocating for sustainable fashion, an industry where the Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates that less than 1% of clothing is recycled.

In Hong Kong, for example, a company called Green Baby collects, repairs and resells secondhand baby clothes, toys and accessories – and helps teenage and single mothers into work by employing them across the business.

But going circular also means regenerating natural systems in and around cities, said Schnitger, pointing to Singapore, which has developed 72 extra acres of vegetation by greening the rooftops of buildings.

David Berg, managing director of Circular in Rotterdam, a municipal initiative to minimise waste, said cities need to think creatively to get citizens on board.

For example, Rotterdam uses golden waste trucks to “tell residents that waste is worth gold”, he explained, adding that the city aims to become waste-free by 2050.

City planners should create regulation that incentivises businesses and citizens to go circular, said Potocnik.

Ultimately, “the circular economy is unavoidable”, he said.",South Africa,2019.05
619,Circular economy or vicious circle?,"Shortly before her death last year, former environment minister Edna Molewa described the circular economy as a ""trillion-dollar opportunity"", with huge potential for innovation, job creation and economic growth.

The concept of a circular economy differs from the traditional linear economy, in which virgin resources are extracted, processed and then dumped as waste. By attempting to extend the life of natural resources by recycling, reusing and recirculating them, the aim is to ""close the loop"" and reduce waste and inefficiency.

As part of the SA-European Union Development and Co-operation Agreement, the government hoped to co-operate more closely with EU members on circular economy initiatives - with an initial focus on tyres, paper and packaging, lighting and electrical and electronic wastes.

But there's a hitch

Noting that nearly 90% of SA's waste was still dumped in landfills, Molewa said the government had identified several sectors where wealth could be extracted from the so-called dead capital of waste products, notably the plastics sector.

However, some resource economists remain dubious about the benefits promised by the circular economy model and suggest that efficiency gains could produce a ""rebound effect"" in which cheaper production methods spur companies to produce even more products than before.

Writing in the Journal of Industrial Ecology in August 2018, resource management professors Trevor Zink and Roland Geyer said proponents of the circular economy had tended to look at the world purely as an engineering system, overlooking the economic aspects.

""We argue that circular economy activities can increase overall production, which can partially or fully offset their benefits. Circular economy rebound occurs when circular economy activities, which have lower per-unit-production impacts, also cause increased levels of production - reducing their benefit.

""We caution that simply encouraging private firms to find profitable opportunities in the circular economy is likely to cause rebound, and [to] lower or eliminate the potential environmental benefits,"" they said.",South Africa,2019.05
879,Circling back on the circular economy,"A lot has happened since the concept of transitioning to a circular economy took off in the 1990s. As a quick recap, the circular economy is more than recycling, although that is part of it. Being circular means starting from a place that uses sustainable raw materials, designing products for longevity and making it easy for them to be repaired, and then recycled when they have reached their true point of obsolescence. It also includes adopting trade-in, and products and services sharing business models.

Although some would say adoption has not been fast enough, progress has been made. The European Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform network now has 350 members across the EU, and in May this year, the American Chemistry Council’s (ACC) Plastics Division announced three ambitious goals that crystallise US plastics resin producers’ commitment to recycle or recover all plastic packaging used in the United States by 2040.

In the past two years, there has been a flurry of announcements by high-profile enterprises, which will hopefully influence other businesses: Starbucks committed to waste reduction by phasing out plastic straws by December 2020, which will eliminate more than 1 billion straws a year. Ikea aims to become “people and planet positive by 2030”, designing all products within new circular principles, using only renewable and recycled materials, and offering services that make it easier for people to pass products on.

Drivers behind the move towards a circular economy include recognition that resources are finite and, if they are a crop, affected by climate change. Businesses that want to survive in the long term need to future-proof themselves against the depletion of raw materials and the resulting cost increases. But it’s not about doom and gloom, it’s actually about unlocking a potential $4.5 trillion in new economic growth by 2030, which has been identified as a possibility by Accenture.

This makes the circular economy an exciting place in which to operate. For companies that are under continuous pressure to reduce costs, discovering the financial benefits of circular business models should be a great incentive for embracing them. These benefits include opportunities for new revenue streams, cost reduction, establishing more efficient supply chains, and improving business intelligence and increased innovation.

Accenture identifies five business models that it predicts will drive the circular economy. The first is Sharing Platforms that maximise the use of under-used assets, such as hotel rooms, vehicles or consumer goods (in mature economies, 80% of typical household items are only used once a month). Ownership will be replaced with Products-as-a-Service, which only charge for user time. Both these models encourage the long-term maintenance, longevity and efficiency of products. Next, there is Product Life Extension, which relies on the re-manufacturing and repairing of used products to give them a longer life with existing or new customers. The last two are Circular Supply Chains that allow suppliers and partners to use recycled materials repeatedly, save costs and bring predictability to supply chains; and Recovery and Recycling, which saves costs and reduces the volume of waste and landfills.

As the realisation that the circular economy is a way to improve the bottom line becomes established, businesses, banks and governments must work together to help spread awareness far and wide. These are the trusted institutions that can encourage and support circular economy initiatives in small and medium-sized businesses as well as large enterprise organisations.

As outlined, a true circular economy is more than removing waste and recycling. Eco-design principles must be included from the get-go, so that limited-resource materials can be designed out of the supply chain. Apple’s 2018 Environmental Responsibility Report Progress Report states it committed to a circular or “closed loop” supply chain in 2017, and materials such as minerals are now being recovered from old devices with the aim of eventually being able to cease all mining. Similarly, at Lexmark, cartridges returned to its manufacturing facilities through the Lexmark Cartridge Collection Programme (LCCP) are disassembled, and then components suitable for re-use are picked out and used in the production of new ones. This year, Lexmark’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) key performance indicator (KPI) stats show encouraging progress since 2015. In waste creation, the company has achieved a 74% recycling rate, and its goal of reducing the sleep power consumption for its colour laser multifunction products has also been successful, at 93%.

The circular economy is all about unlocking new opportunities for growth. The growing scarcity of resources is almost a red herring, but if fear of running out of raw materials helps to change perceptions about waste, then all to the good. Waste has been built into business models for decades, but waste can be turned into wealth through keeping resources, components, products and services as economically viable for as long as possible. As with all innovation, the early adopters will gain the advantage.",South Africa,2019.06
583,Rwanda is a classic example of environmental conservation – UNEP Director,"With the world experiencing dramatic changes in the environment due to global warming, experts say that the lives of animals, plants and people are at stake. This calls for more global efforts to tackle real and potential risks.

The New Times’ Julius Bizimungu spoke to Joyce Msuya, the Deputy Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) on what countries should be doing to reverse the deteriorating situation.

Msuya was in Rwanda last week to attend the Kigali Global Dialogue.

You met with the leadership of Rwanda, including the Foreign Affairs Minister. What were the conversations about?

 

 This is a long overdue first visit to Rwanda. I am here for the Kigali Global Dialogue meeting but I am taking advantage of those conversations to have bilateral meetings since it is my first meeting.

I have met Ambassador Richard Sezibera, Environment Minister Vincent Biruta and the Head of Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA) and other officials. The conversation with Government officials has been threefold.

One was trying to find out from the environment perspective what are the challenges or opportunities and the priorities of the Government and how can the UN Environment support them.

Linked to that was to get feedback. Where we have worked in the past, how are we doing because we serve member states and Rwanda is part of that?

Two is learning from Rwanda. Globally, the issues of co-existence of nature and the people is at the cornerstone. What we are trying to learn from Rwanda is the success story around the gorillas and how the Government has taken it up to preserve nature, but at the same time build communities around it in the spirit of co-existence.

Lastly, was to talk to Rwandese nationals. At the Kigali Global Dialogue, I have been engaging the youth, women trying to understand from citizen perspective what is in their minds vis-a-vis environmental issues.

Globally, youth have become the champions and advocates of climate change.

You came here after attending the Africa Wildlife Economy Summit – the first of its kind – which took place in Zimbabwe. How important was the meeting given the scale of changes seen today?

It was an extremely timely and relevant meeting. Let me start with the context first; I have lived in many parts of the world, but what I have come to constantly appreciate is how rich the [African] continent and countries are when it comes to nature – whether it is the oceans, the mountains, etc.

The meeting was important because it was the first meeting to be held in Africa to talk about wildlife economy; not just wildlife but wildlife in the context of economic development as well as creating wealth for Africans and reducing poverty in Africa.

It had the highest political representation and active participation. There were four heads of states (Zimbabwe, Zambia, Namibia and Botswana) and they were there four two days. There were also 14 ministers from Africa. It basically showed the highest political will.

Third was the fact that communities were at the centre of the conversations. There were traditional leaders and heads of communities taking part in the conversation, and this is because wildlife is all about people.

Lastly, thanks to the Government of Zimbabwe that took us to Victoria Falls to show us the impact of climate change on the volume of water, but also how does Victoria Falls act as a cornerstone for fishing industry – economic aspect of nature.

The focus of the meeting – shifting dynamics of the continent’s wildlife economy to place communities at the centre and encourage public-private partnerships to earn more revenues for countries, is something President Paul Kagame has been championing. Would you say Africa is on the right track?

I would say Africa has made progress but there is more to be done. We should not forget that Africa has 54 countries and they are diverse. I come from Tanzania where there are 126 different tribes, different regions with different levels of development.

When I say public-private partnerships is making progress, and you look at tourism industry in Rwanda and in Kenya, clearly there is a role for the Government to set the policies that attract investments.

Rwanda is a classic example. If you address corruption, the foreign direct investments come in much easier, but also jobs creation, tourism companies are mostly private and they follow good investment climate.

Most African Governments are open to partnering with private sector, but it is also fair to say that there is more work to be done, for example, in improving our governance and investment climate to attract more private sector.

If you look at statistics, Africa has an asset of youth population and that is a huge asset for potential jobs in nature, environment. In some of the countries there are Governments that are working to convert trash into treasure by creating jobs for youth.

There is still more work to be done on youth, of pulling in women, of addressing regulatory challenges that are facing some of these segments of the population, but also compliance and enforcement of these regulations.

Currently, there seems to be much talk about biodiversity economy. Has the continent really understood the economic importance of protecting its wildlife?

I think countries are increasingly understanding, for example yesterday I was having a conversation with your people talking about how to provide data for wildlife – basically, putting monetary value on our nature as part of the entire planning.

We (at UNEP) are working on natural wealth accounting mechanisms with a number of countries in Africa, to basically say this is how much you are economy will benefit if you protect and value your nature.

The world is experiencing environmental trends like loss of biodiversity, loss of water resources, and loss of fertile soils, among others. What are other top trends the earth’s system is facing?

In terms of themes, there are about four. One is indigenous species. There is a recently launched report by IBPS (Intergovernmental panel), which articulated one million species are in danger of going extinct and most of those species are located on this continent.

Two is climate change. My first visit when I arrived in Nairobi was to Zanzibar and saw how as an island they were suffering. This is true for many African countries.

Three is air pollution. 600,000 people die per year because of the impact of air pollution. Most of it comes from fossil fuels but also transport and this is because Africa is urbanising very fast. The other one is energy. When I go back to my village in Kilimanjaro I still see my relatives do charcoal and that involves cutting trees.

The last theme is waste. Because of urbanisation, trash, plastics are on the rise.

It is good to see countries including Rwanda taking leadership in banning plastic bags. Before I came here everybody told me Rwanda is very clean but that is not the norm in other African countries. How do we manage our waste? How do we actually capitalise on circular economy? But also reducing the amount of waste we generate.

How many of these environmental trends are human-made?

Most of them, I would say, are man-made or influenced. Climate change is one, cutting trees, air pollution is a result of the types of choices we make like through cars, and energy sector is another one.

But what that means frankly is an opportunity for us as humans to make different choices – instead of buying plastics, for instance, we buy something else.

What are the most important steps to stop the negative trends?

It varies from one country to another. If you look at the island states, clearly climate change is on top, and what that means is to take advantage of mangroves or other innovations to mitigate and adapt to climate change.

If you look at nature, Government has a role to play to institute the right policies. Gorilla conservation is an example of that – charging for more to limit the number of people that goes to national parks.

On ocean pollution, a number of governments are looking into banning plastics and some have already banned plastics. Again, reducing plastics that end up in oceans and have an impact on fish life and consequently affects the overall health of people is important.

On energy, there is need for transition to renewable energy – moving away from fossil fuels and moving away from cutting trees.

We can also take advantage of the fourth industrial revolution. Rwanda is using artificial intelligence to monitor the volumes of rains as part of finding out the impact of climate change.

You mentioned plastics as one of the issues, but the ban of single-use plastics have seen businesses raise more concerns. How can we reconcile them and what alternatives are there for them?

When it comes to banning plastics, we need to recognise that Africa has taken leadership. We have Rwanda, Kenya, Eritrea, and Tanzania has just joined. You don’t see that globally.

Evidence has shown, however, that banning plastics is a process. You have to look at jobs, do a thorough assessment. It is a process that requires analysis, finding alternatives, and or retraining workers who are working in plastics factories into other types of skill-sets.

In other countries, governments have provided transitional subsidies to help them transition into a new economy.

On the other hand, what has helped is to show the cost of inaction; if you don’t ban plastics, what it the potential cost on the health budget if people get sick or develop cancer? There you see a lot of movement when it comes to policy.

There has been debate around financing most environmental initiatives given how costly they are. What are some of the sustainable financing models that Africa should adopt?",Rwanda,2019.07
607,Circular Economy Is Saving The Planet And Boosting Profits,"Shoes made from ocean plastics, packaging material made from mushrooms and a green partnership between Ford and Heinz to build car parts from tomato fibre are examples of the circular economy in action.

In a traditional linear economy, materials flow in a line; they are taken from the earth, made into an item in an affordable way, and waste goes into landfills when we are finished using the product. Circular economy has been inaccurately referred to as “recycling on steroids”.

It was shown to be much more in an impactful presentation by United States based supply chain specialist Deborah Dull at the recent SAPICS Conference in Cape Town. She contends that supply chain management - and the circular economy - can save the planet. In her current role as Principal, Supply Chain Management, at General Electric subsidiary GE Digital, Dull works across the supply chain community to accelerate the transition to a circular economy.

Her goal is to progress past a linear “take-make-waste” approach to one in which supply chains around the world are supporting a “make-reuse circular approach to dramatically lengthen the lifecycle of the items around us”.

“Circular economy is already well under way around the world and goes beyond sustainability agendas,” Dull informed delegates in her presentation at the annual SAPICS Conference, which this year attracted some 800 supply chain professionals representing 28 countries.

“The circular economy builds on the idea of industrial symbiosis where the idea is that a series of factories are set up next to each other; the biproduct or residual product of one factory process is used as a resource by another. Through local collaboration, public and private enterprises buy and sell residual products from one another, both making money and saving the environment. With new Industry 4.0 technologies, the concepts beyond the industrial symbiosis can be stretched across digital supply networks, allowing for materials and byproduct exchanges to happen at scale.”

Organisations and governments are investing in these initiatives because of the capabilities of the circular economy, including profits, she said.

Challenging the misconception that saving the planet always comes at a cost, Dull reported that the circular economy is on track to add USD4.5 trillion to the global economy by 2030 and create hundreds of thousands of new jobs. “I argue that the true focus of circular is first on the ‘economy’ part; on expanding profits,” she stated.

Sports brand Adidas is embracing circular economy principles in its partnership with “Parley for the Oceans”, an environmental organisation that is fighting environmental threats posed by ocean plastic pollution. “In 2017, Adidas sold one million pairs of its Parley brand shoes, which are made with ocean plastic. In 2018, five million pairs were sold; and Adidas has announced that it will make 11 million pairs in 2019. These are not inexpensive shoes, but they are in demand,” Dull said.

Proctor & Gamble is making bottles from recycled plastic and ocean plastic. “As part of their ‘Ambition 2030 Initiative’, they have taken nearly all of their manufacturing facilities past zero waste towards circular models and have saved over USD2 billion.”

She revealed that there is growing emphasis on designing products for the circular economy. EcoCradle is one such product. Designed to replace Styrofoam, it is a mushroom-based packaging material that is now being used by furniture giant IKEA. “It grows relatively quickly.

It is cost effective; and it decomposes in 30 to 90 days,” explained Dull, adding that the global market for sustainable packaging is expected to reach more than USD140 billion in coming years.

The circular economy highlights the importance of extending the useful life of an item for as long as possible. This has increased “Product as a Service” offerings across the market, such as Uber, US-based “Rent the Runway” clothing rental, and – for an industrial example – “time on wing” for airplane engines. Dull explained that GE Aviation offers this time on wing through an “Outcome as a Service” offering to airlines, which means GE Aviation is responsible for predictive and preventative maintenance.

“This is important, because assets are smart. Machines are intelligent. The Industrial Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 are bringing together sensors, advanced analytics, and machine learning. This combination means that the engine tells us when it needs to be serviced. And, as you can imagine, this is very powerful.” Maintenance, Dull explained, is a key enabler of the circular economy.

Dull finished her presentation by exploring the impacts of the circular economy on the supply chain, asking delegates to imagine waste as something of value that will be exchanged among supply chains as input to products and processing.

With materials exchanges starting to emerge across the world, Dull showcased early examples of “parts passports”, which record an asset’s details and history, including market analysis for valuation, and pair up potential buyers and sellers.

“We need to start thinking about waste as inventory. Consider how much of the circular challenge could be solved if everyone switched, tomorrow, to using recovered materials only – and no longer used new, virgin materials,” she challenged.

At circular economy forums around the world, supply chain professionals are missing from the conversation. Dull concluded by urging SAPICS delegates to “invite yourselves to the discussions; supply chain teams find solutions to impossible challenges across the world. Now is the time to come together as a global community and create supply chains that can support circular business models”.

813,Lack of funds to enable connectivity a major challenge,"DURBAN - As the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) gains momentum the digital divide is growing, leaving KwaZulu-Natal women behind. Moses Kotane Institute (MKI) chief executive Thandeka Ellenson says only 1.1 percent of households in the province have access to the internet, while ownership of digital devices in rural areas is low. “As the digital revolution spreads rapidly, the notion of a digital divide in the rural areas should be taken into consideration,” says Ellenson.

Ellenson says KZN needs to create opportunities for women in the informal sector of KZN to benefit from the 4IR as they are at the nexus of rural economies and technology.

But the lack of funds to enable this connectivity and infrastructure is a major challenge.

“Equipment, such as 3D printers, is not available for everyone to have access to.

""To have this available to businesses and women in the province requires funding,” says Ellenson.

To ignite more innovators and to increase more ownership on innovative products/service KZN is rolling out innovation labs in its rural municipalities, while the provincial government also has a plan for a big KZN Innovation Hub in the near future.

MKI is working with the Dube Trade Port, which has already implemented a platform, which will enable rapid go-to-market of new technologies, through an existing base of small, micro and medium enterprises ICT companies.

The organisation is also rolling out innovation labs that will allow citizens in rural municipalities to access technology facilities such as 3D printing.

The first lab is at Okhahlamba. A provincial innovation hub conceptualisation is also under way.

MKI says universal access to internet facilities coupled with digital literacy is key to empowering women and to enabling a more inclusive digital and technology-centred economy.

Ellenson says the MKI’s Innovation Ignition Project is aimed at supporting entrepreneurs aspiring to initiate projects that are aimed at building their community's ability to supply their growing demand for goods and services.

“The long-term goal of this project is for entrepreneurs to own the means of production in their communities, supply their own markets and create a circular economy.

“In the process, the community-based entities will obtain the relevant skills and knowledge needed to close the digital gaps and develop their businesses.

""In return, they will lift themselves out of poverty, while reducing inequality and their community's unemployment rate.”

MKI, which wants to be an internationally-recognised quality research institution driving economic development in KZN, says 4IR has spawned the sharing economy.

A typical example of sharing economy is ride-hailing online services, such as Uber and Bolt (taxify)service, which allow customers to obtain taxi services from private car owners. In the context of KZN – a newly defined co-operative model is the future.

Ellenson says women are used to adapting to change and should therefore have no problem adapting to technological movements.

However, more research was needed on which skills would be required for the future as well as to seek to provide answers and predict the economic scenario for KwaZulu-Natal some 10 and 15 years from now, says Ellenson.

864,Plastics and their role in creating a circular economy,"A circular economy is a new way of looking at product life cycles and how we consume raw materials. The linear model of consumption that we have used for centuries (take, make, use, dispose) is not sustainable. It requires us to use valuable raw materials and natural resources, which has negative effects on the planet and the climate.

A circular economy stems around the idea that we can feed waste back into the supply chain – essentially reusing and recycling our refuse to create valuable products that can be resold. This reduce, reuse, recycle model of consumption is far more sustainable and better suited to products like plastic and recyclable materials.

As society becomes more aware of its impact on the planet, people are finding more innovative ways to reuse their waste and retain its value, rather than letting it sit in a landfill. Plastics are a prime example of valuable recyclable materials that often get dumped in waste management facilities.

A circular economy will only work if there is input from all sectors of society. The government needs to work alongside businesses, communities and individuals. Every South African will need to embrace recycling and actively participate in sustainable waste disposal practices in order for a circular economy to thrive.

The country currently has some of the highest recycling rates in the world, which is a brilliant start. Plastic recycling rates are improving year-on-year, but there is always room for improvement. Plastics are a valuable material and should be reused as much as possible. Even single-use plastic products can be reused in the home for a variety of purposes.

Public education and raising awareness of the importance of recycling is just one step to improving recycling rates. The plastics industry is also playing its part by working to improve the recyclability of its products.

The future of plastics is more sustainable

While most plastics are recyclable, they cannot be recirculated infinitely. After being recycled a number of times, the plastics start to become brittle. Plastics manufacturers are working towards making their products more sustainable and recyclable.

The industry is also researching alternative ways to make plastics, such as creating products from plant-based polymers. This will allow the plastics to break down and decompose if left in the environment. The future of the plastics industry revolves around sustainability and the circularity of the products’ life cycles.

Another factor that influences the recyclability of plastic is its colour. Black plastic can be difficult to recycle because the infrared scanning sensors at recycling facilities cannot detect the black pigment. Luckily, many of South Africa’s recycling centres use manual labour to sort plastic waste so the black plastic is not a major problem.

Although plastics are perfectly suited to a circular economy, the recycling infrastructure in South Africa will also need to be upgraded if this system is to become a reality. Our waste management facilities will play a vital role in turning plastic waste into high-quality, reusable products that can be fed back into the supply chain.

The national government can support these facilities and invest in the upgrades in order to establish a circular economy in South Africa. This will not only help recyclers to increase their handling capacities but will also allow them to improve the quality of their output products. Private companies can also help to provide funding for the support of our recycling network.

A circular economy is not a farfetched idea, nor is it unattainable. By embracing recycling, improving the recyclability of plastic products and investing in waste management facilities, South Africa could benefit from a sustainable economy. By reusing plastic waste and turning it into sellable products, the country could benefit from a cleaner environment and retain the value of plastic at the same time.

Plastics SA represents all sectors of the South African plastics industry. ​Together with our associations, we play an active role in the growth and development of the industry and strive to address plastics related issues, influence role-players and make plastics the material of choice.

​Plastics SA has been mandated to ensure a vibrant and sustainable plastics industry in South Africa.

914,Rwanda keen on cutting waste to zero,"Rwanda’s environment protection efforts have the potential to transform it from a linear to circular economy, characterised by minimal industrial waste as well as resource efficiency, officials have said.

They were speaking on Thursday at the national circular economy forum that brought together experts from the industry and environment sectors.

The gathering discussed strategies of advancing a circular economy also known as zero waste economy, which is characterised by extracting the most value possible from all kinds of resources.

Such a system, experts say, minimises natural resource use, waste, emissions, and energy by closing energy and materials loops.

Participants were tipped on how the principles of the circular economy including long-lasting product design, maintenance, repair, reuse, remanufacturing refurbishing as well as recycling, can help to boost profits and make business more competitive.

According to Dr Vincent Biruta, the Minister of Environment, Rwanda has been working to align its economic transformation with environmental protection and conservation.

“Too often, these are seen as conflicting objectives,” he said. “Fortunately, we now understand that sustainable economic growth is only possible with a strong environmental foundation.”

The Minister said that the country’s Green Growth and Climate Resilience Strategy is guiding Rwanda to become a developed, low carbon economy by 2050.

“Such a goal is only achievable if local industries produce in a way that is not only sustainable, but improves environmental outcomes for both people and the planet,” he said.

The Minister also stressed the need for industries and businesses to integrate the circular economy into their operations, rather than continue with the current ‘take, make, dispose’ model of consumption.

“In the linear economy we extract resources, turn them into products and then throw them into landfill at the end of their life. In a circular economy, all of the resources are re-used either by having long-lasting products, repairing and sharing products, or recycling materials,” Biruta said.

He noted that the circular economy has the potential to create jobs, increase economic growth and increase living standards.

He added that an estimated 3.4 million people are already employed in circular economy jobs such as repair, waste recycling, and the rental and leasing sectors across the Europena Union (EU), as well as huge numbers across Africa, with great potential for expansion.

“In many places around the world, including in Rwanda, the circular economy operates as an informal economy. Our task now is to scale up existing circular economy initiatives and develop new ones,” he said.

He cited initiatives such as the e-waste dismantling and recycling facility in Bugesera District, ride-sharing apps, construction materials made from recycled agriculture waste, plastic recycling, water reuse and refurbishing electronic equipment, among others.

The Minister also spoke about how Rwanda’s ban on polythene packaging materials more than a decade ago and the recent decision to phase out single-use plastics are supporting the move to a circular economy.

“The ban on polythene packaging created new circular business opportunities and we hope the same will be true as we transition to alternatives to single-use plastics,” he said.

“We need to identify existing small scale, innovative initiatives and invest in them and connect local businesses to global leaders so they can access the best technology and the latest insights,” he added.

The Minister said the government recently established the Cleaner Production and Climate Innovation Centre, which is hosted under National Industrial Research and Development Agency (NIRDA).

The centre will be a one-stop centre of excellence which provides and promotes access to cutting edge and modern green technologies as well as business services for enhanced productivity, advancing the circular economy, and boosting climate resilience, competitiveness and environmental compliance.

According to Olivier Kamana, Head of Applied Research at NIRDA, the circular economy should be integrated into all sectors and industries to boost productivity and profits.

“We have to promote a circular economy as it is imperative for businesses to survive and thrive. We are ready at NIRDA to support industries to promote the circular economy,” Kamana said.

According to Coletha Ruhamya, Director General of Rwanda Environment Management Authority, the private sector stands to gain from being part of the fight against plastic pollution and promoting the circular economy.

“There are many opportunities for the private sector in the circular economy and we welcome the many companies who are already taking up their responsibility, fighting single-use plastics and making the shift to the circular economy,” she said.

“Investing in reusable alternatives like water dispensers, jugs and glasses is not only good for the environment but also cost effective,” she added.",Rwanda,2019.08
12,Supply chain must shift to circular economies,"As consumer and shareholder preferences shift toward sustainability, chief supply chain officers (CSCOs) must prepare for the transformation from a linear to a circular supply chain without waste.

According to Gartner, by 2029, the circular economy will be the only economy, replacing wasteful linear economies.

Gartner defines the circular economy as an economic model that separates the ability to achieve economic growth from the consumption of natural resources.

Circular economic business models encourage continuous reuse of materials to minimise waste and the demand for additional natural resource consumption.

“Organisations are under pressure to reduce the amount of waste they’re producing – from consumers and governments alike,” says Steven Steutermann, managing vice-president in the Gartner Supply Chain practice. “The solution to this challenge is a shift towards a circular, waste-free economy.

“The supply chain will play a key role in this process. Eighty-four percent of participants in Gartner’s recent Supply Chain and the Circular Economy Survey stated that the supply chain has, or will have, decision-making authority when it comes to their organisation’s circular economy strategies and initiatives.”

Switching from a linear to a circular economy is not a go-it-alone project – it requires a whole ecosystem. CSCOs should collaborate with internal product designers and suppliers to understand exactly how products are consumed and disposed after consumption.

“To turn around a supply chain system, 10 years is not a long time. CSCOs should deploy change management programs and start pilots now,” adds Steutermann. “The pilots will provide valuable learnings and help build momentum for further circular economy initiatives.”

Another action to take is to join a consortium or alliance, such as Make Fashion Circular, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste or Loop, an online shopping concept designed to eliminate single-use packaging.

“Getting together with like-minded professionals will support CSCOs to sketch out a vision for an intelligent ecosystem of partners and peers,” Steutermann adds. “They should start with a single question, such as ‘How can I reduce packaging?’, and expand from there.”

According to the survey, the biggest challenge to circular-economy efforts is setting measurable goals.

Often, the key challenge in setting these goals – as with any transformational initiative – is substantiating how the proposed changes will impact consumer preferences and, ultimately, margins.

“While some metrics on sustainability already exist, they are mostly related to linear metrics, such as reducing waste to landfills or carbon dioxide emissions. It is important not to confuse those metrics with the circular economy,” Steutermann says.

“Good metrics for the circular economy could be the percentages of reclaimed, reused materials for production and the reduction of single-use plastic.”",South Africa,2019.09
39,UK marine litter scientists tackle pollution in SA,"Cape Town – Marine litter scientists from the UK kicked-off work in South Africa this week to tackle plastic pollution in the ocean in the hopes of reducing reliance on single-use plastics, improving waste management and moving towards a more circular economy for plastics. Experts from the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas), part of the UK government’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), have partnered with the South African government and research colleagues in the country to identify solutions to problems posed by marine litter. The Commonwealth Litter Programme (CLiP) launched with a community beach outreach event in Cape Town on Tuesday, where Cefas scientists demonstrated scientific monitoring techniques and held an exhibition on marine litter challenges and solutions. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex Prince Harry and Meghan, who are on a tour of South Africa, met Cefas’s principal marine litter scientist Thomas Maes during the event to hear more about the CLiP programme and approaches to tackling marine litter internationally. In recent years, the serious issue of marine litter and plastic pollution has been recognised by international governments and organisations, as well as local communities, as a growing threat to the marine environment and people’s livelihoods.

The programme is working with colleagues in the South African government, regional organisations, academia and community groups, to carry out scientific monitoring and to develop ideas and actions which support existing efforts and will enable them to further achieve their ambitions on tackling plastic pollution.

UK International Environment Minister Zac Goldsmith said: “It is fantastic to see world-leading UK scientists joining their Commonwealth counterparts and sharing expertise in the international fight to tackle the plastic waste that devastates our marine environment.”

Maes said the centre was delighted to be collaborating with government and other organisations.

“Cefas has international expertise and experience in marine litter science and policy which we are pleased to share with South Africa, and other partner nations, to help address the problem.”

South Africa is the fourth country to be involved in the CLiP work and the team will bring their experiences from the previous phases of the programme which took place in the two South Pacific island nations of Vanuatu and Solomon Islands, and more recently in Belize, in the Caribbean.

Scientists will be in the region until December, working with local colleagues and stakeholders to monitor litter, clean beaches, set up a microplastics laboratory and raise awareness of actions which can be taken.",South Africa,2019.09
178,Mining companies stand to benefit from circular economy – Rapson,"JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – As the circular economy grows, it poses a major risk for mining companies because, essentially, it means that people are reusing the same products over and over, thereby using less and less of the raw materials that are mined by mining companies, Webber Wentzel environment and natural resources partner Garyn Rapson points out.

Mining companies can, however, survive amid an increasing drive towards the circular economy if they listen to their customers.

Further, there were also potential benefits to operationalising the circular economy, he noted during a mining round-up event at the law firm’s offices, in Sandton, on Tuesday.

In doing so, mining companies will “be the winners” in the eyes of consumers in terms of the metals and materials they produce, while simultaneously creating a platform for economic benefits to operationalise on-site from projects.

This would be key, he added, since mining companies that operationalise the circular economy would be ahead of the curve as the global economy moves into a world post the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

“Not only will you be preferred from your customer’s perspective, but you will be able to generate revenue if you take some of these projects seriously,” Rapson highlighted.

He cautioned, however, that mining companies had to seek proper regulatory advice and ensure the right approvals and consents were in place, as that would form the foundation on which these projects could be implemented effectively.",South Africa,2019.09

328,Vanadium is essential for renewables in a circular economy,"Despite these drawbacks, lithium-ion batteries remain the best known available solution for consumer electronics and electric vehicles. However, in stationary storage, the more sustainable option is vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs).

A VRFB is designed to last for 20 years or more, meaning that fewer batteries need to be deployed than if lithium-ion ones were used. More important, the chemical electrolyte in the battery can be fully re-used once the electrical and mechanical components wear out.

The circularity of vanadium in energy storage is even more impressive when the scenario of redeploying the vanadium from the battery for other uses is considered. If there is no demand for new batteries, that electrolyte can be easily reprocessed by existing vanadium mining and processing facilities, at minimal cost, into products such as ferrovanadium and vanadium pentoxide for use in high-strength steels and speciality alloys and chemicals.

Two factors make vanadium electrolyte relatively easy to process. It is mostly water and only one mineral needs to be extracted — vanadium. Recycling a lithium-ion battery entails separating out lithium, nickel, manganite and cobalt among other minerals, which is a more complex, costly and energy-intensive process.

These characteristics currently make vanadium the most environmentally friendly, large-scale battery material in a circular economy.

For SA, this creates a massive opportunity in both the energy transition and the circular economy. This country has the largest high-grade deposits of vanadium in the world, so it can benefit from increased vanadium demand through mining. SA also processes most of its vanadium, and these processing plants can be used again in the future to reprocess vanadium electrolyte for other uses, regardless of whether the batteries themselves were deployed here or abroad. That means more jobs for today and in the future.

One of the hurdles in any recycling initiative is the logistics and costs associated with collecting waste, which can make recycling uneconomical. For example, the manufacturers of lead batteries have set up collection chains to take used batteries, but those costs are included in the end price.

For vanadium, a rental structure can be created. Instead of having to pay the full capital cost of a battery upfront — which is influenced by prevailing vanadium market prices — and be presented with the problem of disposing of it when it reaches the end of its life, the operator of the battery pays a smaller fee upfront followed by regular, ongoing rental payments.

Once the battery energy is exhausted, the vanadium can be redeployed into another battery or reprocessed for sale into the steel sector. This structure creates an incentive to recycle the batteries at an attractive cost to the end-user.

The responsibility of policy makers in a circular economy is to factor in the costs upfront for sustainable disposal (not just removal) of technologies that are difficult to re-use or recycle and overtly include this cost in tenders for projects. The carbon tax was recently introduced to address this type of cost for coal and gas. Policy makers also have the power to positively encourage technologies where sustainability is already proven, using tools such as preferential tax treatment or other incentives.",South Africa,2019.09
680,Adapting to circular economy makes ‘good business sense’ – Accenture,"JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – With economies seeking to tap into the $4.5-trillion opportunity that the circular economy presents, mining companies are under pressure to adapt faster and embrace change in order to remain relevant, Accenture senior MD Rachael Bartels said last week.

Speaking to Mining Weekly Online on the sidelines of the Joburg Indaba, she explained that, by taking the right steps, mining and metals companies could reposition themselves to create a sustainable source of new revenue streams through the economy.

This is particularly important, she added, considering that shifting downstream demand was creating a risk as more innovative players were capitalising on emerging opportunities to monetise the circular economy.

The circular economy continually uses and re-uses many of the same resources to minimise environmental impacts and was attracting more and more attention as companies started to see the benefits from effective recovery, Bartels said.

However, she lamented that mining and metals companies were not always well positioned to monetise the flow of recycled metals, considering that the industry usually focused on operational efficiency, such as recycling water or monetising waste streams, such as slag or used tyres.

“The trick is how to actually do that at scale, and tie it to your purpose,” Bartels elaborated.

With demand slowing in some sectors, the transition to a low-carbon economy is creating increased demand for base and precious metals, silver, nickel, lead and zinc, Accenture has found.

In this respect, both Accenture and Bartels advise stakeholders to determine where best to focus in a shifting marketplace, and how best to take advantage of both the circular economy and clean technology trends.

Referring to a study done by Accenture, she noted that consumers had changed their buying behaviour based on sustainable products.

“The reality is that a significant proportion of people, well over half [of respondents in the study], have changed their buying behaviour based on their perception of the brand that they’re buying and the sustainability of either the brand or the products that they’re buying,” she pointed out.

This speaks to the drive towards the circular economy growing globally, with Accenture, during the United Nations Sustainability Summit, completing another CEO review, which sought to find out what CEOs’ thoughts were on sustainability.

“The CEOs that we canvassed were saying that [sustainability] is becoming increasingly important, [that] they’re not doing enough and are increasing the number of things that they are actually doing,” Bartels notes.

She adds that she is “seeing a massive push” towards the circular economy, part of which is coming from the consumer and part of it is coming from the first tier of companies that are interacting with the consumers.

“I’m also seeing it as a whole recognition that being more circular makes good business sense,” she pointed out.",South Africa,2019.10
838,Insect frass plus palm oil waste equals fish food and less GHG,"Dubai — A pioneering entrepreneur believes insects can help improve the reputation of the palm oil industry, which has for years been accused of causing widespread deforestation, while slashing commercial farming’s voracious water use.

Patrick Crowley, founder of Chapul, the first insect protein foods company in the US, is proposing a “circular economy” for palm oil farmers so that waste and byproducts are used for farming insects on plantations.

“The problem is the human behaviour of clearing rainforests and peat bogs. It’s not palm. It’s the practice. That’s how I see it,” Crowley told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Palm oil is the world’s most widely used edible oil, found in everything from margarine to soap, but has faced scrutiny in recent years from green groups and consumers, who have blamed its production for forest loss, fires and worker exploitation.

Crowley’s insect plan, already piloted for four years in Indonesia, the world’s biggest palm oil producer, involves using empty palm fruit bunches that are often burnt or left to rot after being processed.

This waste has little or no market value but is high in fibre, the hydrologist-turned-CEO said on the sidelines of a conference in Dubai on food production in areas with poor soils and water scarcity.

Natural fungi and bacteria are added to this palm fruit waste to start the fermentation process, increasing its protein content and making it more digestible for insects, he said. Black soldier flies, which are good at converting waste into protein, are given this waste just once before they are then ready to be harvested and fed to farmed fish, probably the world’s fastest growing food-producing sector.

Such insects replace fish meal, which is becoming increasingly scarce and expensive, and palm plantations are attractive because they provide “the largest concentration of homogeneous waste” that can be converted into feed with consistent quality, said Crowley.

Scientists say insect waste, known as frass, is also a great natural fertiliser and can go back into plantations to help boost palm yields, Crowley said. “We’re already seeing an increase in productivity and decrease in use of pesticides in our pilot.”

Crowley was looking at ways to cut agriculture’s water usage — 70% of the world’s freshwater is currently used for farming — when watching a TED talk on insects made him “a reluctant entrepreneur”. He used crowdfunding to set up Chapul — the Aztec word for grasshopper — a year before the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) published a report on insects.

The agency highlighted that they emit fewer greenhouse gases and less ammonia than cattle or pigs, require less land and water — and there are more than 1,900 edible insect species.

Crowley said a consortium of partners bought land on Sumatra island to scale up their 0.2ha pilot facility into five farms of 5ha each.

These farms would use a total of 1-million tonnes of waste per year, produce 200,000 tonnes of larvae, and save 20-million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, he said.

Eduardo Mansur, director of land and water division at the FAO, said it is not only important but necessary to transform the economic systems into circular models.

“Is it possible to do it at once in all sectors? No, but we have to start where we can and agriculture sector, especially water in agriculture, offers a lot of opportunities” he said. “But we have to do it at a scale that will have positive impact to the planet.”",South Africa,2019.11
887,#EntrepreneurMonth: The project creating chicken feed for the circular economy,"Tebogo Bathebeng is the founder of the Montsho Sustainable Project, which harvests Black Soldier fly larvae to produce chicken feed.

With a carefree childhood spent in Soweto, Tebogo Bathebeng studied Industrial Psychology at the University of Johannesburg after which she worked for one of South Africa’s largest insurance companies. Through the company, she completed a foundational leadership course at GIBS Business School, sparking her interested in entrepreneurship.Her first introduction to entrepreneurship was through her father, who worked for an engineering company, but who also had small projects, such as farms, going on on the side.This #EntrepreneurMonth, we chat to Tebogo Bathebeng to find out more about the project that creates chicken feed for the circular economy...Montsho Sustainable Projects is an ecological company that provides products produced by Black Soldier Fly larvae. With the use of processes already available in nature, we produce animal feed high in protein for chickens, pigs and fish as well as compost for crop application.By using the flies’ larvae, we assist the earth’s natural balance and flow by recycling waste and pushing nutrients back into the earth and into the agricultural system.Montsho was birthed in 2018 as an answer to a number of the problems that bothered me - greatly being waste, the degrading agricultural system and unemployment in rural areas.Having come across a tweet about the amount of food waste ending up in landfills and the dire consequences, I decided to research the possible options of tackling the problem and discovered how fly farming can be used to resolve this matter and financial benefits that came with it. Using my savings, I left my job, bought a cage and my first batch of larvae and built my colony.Our core function is animal feed production; that can be fed to chickens, fish and pigs.The biggest obstacle we have encountered was a huge dip in our production during winter, this prompted us into finding innovative methods of rearing our larvae whilst still keeping our plant lean for the rural conditions we operate in.Stay optimistic. Optimism is the friend that makes you see everything from a different perspective and opens you up to a whole new world.My proudest moment thus far is being part of the 2019 class of The Red Bull Amaphiko programme, being at the early stages of my business it was amazing having such a big brand believe in me and the potential of my business, their support has been pivotal in my entrepreneurial journey.I am very excited about the future of entrepreneurship especially in Africa, we are seeing a number of young people come up with ideas, concepts and innovations that are solving some of the biggest challenges we have.I believe programmes such as Red Bull Amaphiko are important because they look at the bigger picture and focus on developing the entrepreneur; believing that for any great idea or business to grow it needs to have a well-developed individual driving it.At the moment the start-up landscape is strangling the life out of businesses. To achieve a thriving start-up culture I believe starting a business should be made easier, government organisations that established to support entrepreneurs and small businesses should have less hoops put in place for individuals who approach them for funding or any other help. I also think penalties (i.e taking off BEE points off the scorecard) have to be put in place for organisations that fail to pay start-ups on time.Purpose-driven, optimism and resilience.The biggest struggle in my entrepreneurial journey has been overcoming self-doubt and the imposter syndrome that sometimes prevents me from taking on opportunities and spaces I am asked to be in.Major highlights for me are the moments I get to sit in front of anyone and educate them about my business, once they get over the initial shock and their interest is sparked in this great wonder, I get to have great conversations about the infinite potential of nature.Yes, entrepreneurship is an amazing journey with great benefits beyond financial rewards. It is also important to note that we all take on entrepreneurship differently and everyone defines the type of entrepreneur they would like to be making entrepreneurship personal and easy for the individual.In the next five years I would like to see young people running Montsho plants in their rural villages, producing products for agrarian communities, contributing to the rural bio-economy in a meaningful way.",South Africa,2019.11
