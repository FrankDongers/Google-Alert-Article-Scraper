3,"Molewa fought for cleaner, greener world for all","Waste is money. This was one of the many mantras of the late environmental affairs minister Dr Edna Molewa - a leader who was committed to ensuring that jobs were created through recycling, alongside creating a cleaner and greener world for all.

As South Africa prepares to celebrate National Marine Week, which is celebrated annually during the second week of October, one is reminded of Molewa's efforts, and commitment, to ensuring our oceans and the land-based sources of litter that ends up in the oceans, is eradicated.

Such was her desire to ensure that all South Africans knew of the wonders of the oceans, that she ensured the department hosted its National Marine Week celebrations in Limpopo two years ago.

Marine pollution is one of the biggest challenges we face today and threatens fragile ecosystems. Because of this, the oceans and our marine environment have been the focus of a number of campaigns.

Earlier this month, SA joined many coastal countries in commemorating the International Coastal Clean-up Day. The day rallied together communities with the common goal of collecting and documenting marine litter around global coastlines.

According to the World Bank, SA produces 54425 tonnes of municipal solid waste daily, and this is the 15th highest rate in the world.

South Africa has shown commitment to addressing the marine litter and micro-plastics challenge through several forums, with Molewa announcing earlier this year that consultations were being held with the cosmetics industry to phase out micro-plastics.

In July 2017, the G20 group of countries, of which South Africa is a member, adopted an Action Plan on Marine Litter. In December 2017, at the margins of the 3rd UN Environment Assembly, South Africa endorsed the UN's Clean Seas Campaign, which exists as a platform for governments to engage the general public, civil society and the private sector to find solutions to the plastic litter challenge.

26,Rwanda partners with Yale University to advance environmental conservation,"The Government of Rwanda and Yale University have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to foster greater cooperation and collaboration in the areas of education and research in sustainable development and environmental protection and conservation.

The signing of the agreement took place during a visit by Minister for Environment, Vincent Biruta, to the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Affairs.

Minister Biruta was joined by the CEO of the Rwanda Green Fund, Hubert Ruzibiza, and the Acting Director of the Centre of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural Resource Management at the University of Rwanda, Beth Kaplin.

As part of their visit, the delegation met with students and staff of the university who have conducted research on the circular economy in Rwanda. They also toured the Gentner Research Group on Air Quality Monitoring as well as the Centre for Engineering, Innovation and Design.

At the agreement signing, President of Yale University, Peter Salovey, spoke about the importance of forging new partnerships with African nations and institutions.

“I am pleased to be signing this agreement with the Ministry of Environment of Rwanda on projects to do with industrial ecology. We are proud to be a collaborator. When I became President, I announced that Yale would have an Africa Initiative.

“In the early years, this has included bringing many more students to Yale from Africa and figuring out ways for domestic students to have educational and research experiences or internships in Africa. But the most important part of the initiative is these kinds of research collaborations, and we are delighted to be entering into one with Rwanda today.”

Under the agreement, Yale University and Rwanda, through the Ministry of Environment and University of Rwanda, will pursue opportunities for collaborative teaching and research in support of the Sustainable Development Goals.

The mutually beneficial collaboration will foster an exchange of resources and capacity building to support the missions of the partners. It will also provide additional new opportunities for Yale students to conduct work and research in Rwanda, and for Rwandan academics to visit Yale University.

“I am very excited to be part of building this partnership. In Rwanda, we are facing environmental and climate challenges and so everything we do in response must be supported by research. Partnerships like the one we have signed are especially critical when addressing complex global challenges. Policy makers and academics must work together to ensure that the latest research is informing the strategies and laws we are creating and implementing. That’s why we are here today,” said Minister Biruta.

The visit by the Rwandan delegation concluded with a public lecture delivered by Biruta at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. Students and faculty engaged with the minister on the impact of climate change in Rwanda and the process undertaken by the world’s nations to reach the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. Concluding his remarks, the minister encouraged Yale students to visit Rwanda to conduct research and support the country’s socio-economic transformation and environmental protection efforts.",Rwanda,2018.09
308,Inside Rwanda's enduring battle to eliminate e-waste,"Samples of e-waste rolls on display at a past e-waste management event in Kigali. Sam Ngendahimana.

Government’s decision to recycle obsolete and old electronic equipment had offered hope that the country was on course to getting rid of electronic waste.

However, latest figures show that the country’s sole e-waste recycling plant has managed to collect 700 tonnes of e-waste since it was leased out to EnviroServe Rwanda, a subsidiary of EnviroServe Dubai.

The plant has so far managed to mitigate 870 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions while 434 tonnes of e-waste have been dismantled and recycled as at the end of October this year.

Yet, it is estimated that Rwanda generates 10,000 tonnes of e-waste every year, which is way higher than what the recycling plant collects.

To handle more capacity, the firm has a plan to expand its operations and open another facility.

Coletha Ruhamya, the Director General of Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA) says they are putting in place a comprehensive policy for waste management to cub the rise of electronic waste.

“The e-waste is increasing and our plan is to have a legal framework in place. We had developed a policy for e-waste but we were advised to have a policy for integrated waste management to enable private investments to come in to help us,” she explained.

The Government entered a lease agreement with EnviroServe Rwanda, a private e-waste electronic recycling company. The firm will run the Bugesera based recycling facility for a period of 10 years.

Company officials say they have been able to set up three collection centres, which will enable them to collect more waste.

“In our first year of operation, we have established three drop-off points (collection centres), even though the plan is to have 30 across the country. This has enabled us to collect more than 700 tonnes of e-waste,” Olivier Mbera, the General Manager of EnviroServe Rwanda, told The New Times.

The company also says that it has the ability to record and separate old equipment from the equipment that can be refurbished.

“We mainly refurbish computers, printers – the equipment that can be reused in schools. What we are doing is good for circular economy because we are promoting the lifespan of the equipment,” Mbera said.

He added that the company has sold nearly 1,300 refurbished computers to schools at a low cost.

The firm also dismantles and recycles e-waste for the purposes of removing hazardous elements as well as recovering valuable components like steel, aluminium, copper and plastic.

The Government says that electronics waste is no longer a burden in Rwanda. This is a big statement for a country that had previously grappled with electronics waste.

An EnviroServe study, which was conducted prior to beginning operations, shows that one institution used to spend between Rwf2 million and Rwf5 million to rent a warehouse to store electronic waste.

Individuals, on the other hand, would throw the waste which would end up in landfills, which posed environmental and hazardous health threats.

There is no study that has been conducted in Rwanda to ascertain the level of health threats posed by e-waste that ends up in landfills can pose. However, these studies have been conducted elsewhere.

Mubera points out that Ghana where such a study was conducted showed that toxic chemicals and metal leads from electronics waste posed cancer threats, among other diseases.

Globally the amount of e-waste continues to grow, while too little is recycled, according to the United Nations.

In 2016, for example, the world generated 44.7 million metric tonnes of e-waste and only 20 per cent was recycled through appropriate channels, the UN’s Global E-waste Monitor 2017 shows.

As efforts to provide solutions to e-waste take shape, EnviroServe says the economic value from the waste is also unmatched, disclosing a few statistics to prove how much they are earning from valuable components.

Valuable components, including copper, steel and aluminium are extracted from the waste, compressed and are sold to processing companies. A tiny portion of other valuables is exported.

“For example, for steel, we sell it to steel industries like Imana Steel as a raw material which is used to produce iron bars. Actually the quality of steel we get from waste is very good,” Mbera notes.

It is not only steel that is sold locally. High density plastic and aluminium also have a market domestically, while copper is exported.

The company says it processes 10 tonnes of steel per month. Plastic processed and sold is at 25 per cent of steel, while less than 1 per cent and 2 per cent of aluminium and copper is sold, respectively.

Steel costs Rwf300 per kilogramme. This means 10 tonnes could generate Rwf3 million per month. Aluminium, on the other hand, costs Rwf800 and a kilogramme goes for over Rwf3,000.",Rwanda,2018.12
757,Circling back on the circular economy,"A lot has happened since the concept of transitioning to a circular economy took off in the 1990s. As a quick recap, the circular economy is more than recycling, although that is part of it. Being circular means starting from a place that uses sustainable raw materials, designing products for longevity and making it easy for them to be repaired, and then recycled when they have reached their true point of obsolescence. It also includes adopting trade-in, and products and services sharing business models.

Although some would say adoption has not been fast enough, progress has been made. The European Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform network now has 350 members across the EU, and in May this year, the American Chemistry Council’s (ACC) Plastics Division announced three ambitious goals that crystallise US plastics resin producers’ commitment to recycle or recover all plastic packaging used in the United States by 2040.

In the past two years, there has been a flurry of announcements by high-profile enterprises, which will hopefully influence other businesses: Starbucks committed to waste reduction by phasing out plastic straws by December 2020, which will eliminate more than 1 billion straws a year. Ikea aims to become “people and planet positive by 2030”, designing all products within new circular principles, using only renewable and recycled materials, and offering services that make it easier for people to pass products on.

Drivers behind the move towards a circular economy include recognition that resources are finite and, if they are a crop, affected by climate change. Businesses that want to survive in the long term need to future-proof themselves against the depletion of raw materials and the resulting cost increases. But it’s not about doom and gloom, it’s actually about unlocking a potential $4.5 trillion in new economic growth by 2030, which has been identified as a possibility by Accenture.

This makes the circular economy an exciting place in which to operate. For companies that are under continuous pressure to reduce costs, discovering the financial benefits of circular business models should be a great incentive for embracing them. These benefits include opportunities for new revenue streams, cost reduction, establishing more efficient supply chains, and improving business intelligence and increased innovation.

Accenture identifies five business models that it predicts will drive the circular economy. The first is Sharing Platforms that maximise the use of under-used assets, such as hotel rooms, vehicles or consumer goods (in mature economies, 80% of typical household items are only used once a month). Ownership will be replaced with Products-as-a-Service, which only charge for user time. Both these models encourage the long-term maintenance, longevity and efficiency of products. Next, there is Product Life Extension, which relies on the re-manufacturing and repairing of used products to give them a longer life with existing or new customers. The last two are Circular Supply Chains that allow suppliers and partners to use recycled materials repeatedly, save costs and bring predictability to supply chains; and Recovery and Recycling, which saves costs and reduces the volume of waste and landfills.

As the realisation that the circular economy is a way to improve the bottom line becomes established, businesses, banks and governments must work together to help spread awareness far and wide. These are the trusted institutions that can encourage and support circular economy initiatives in small and medium-sized businesses as well as large enterprise organisations.

As outlined, a true circular economy is more than removing waste and recycling. Eco-design principles must be included from the get-go, so that limited-resource materials can be designed out of the supply chain. Apple’s 2018 Environmental Responsibility Report Progress Report states it committed to a circular or “closed loop” supply chain in 2017, and materials such as minerals are now being recovered from old devices with the aim of eventually being able to cease all mining. Similarly, at Lexmark, cartridges returned to its manufacturing facilities through the Lexmark Cartridge Collection Programme (LCCP) are disassembled, and then components suitable for re-use are picked out and used in the production of new ones. This year, Lexmark’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) key performance indicator (KPI) stats show encouraging progress since 2015. In waste creation, the company has achieved a 74% recycling rate, and its goal of reducing the sleep power consumption for its colour laser multifunction products has also been successful, at 93%.

The circular economy is all about unlocking new opportunities for growth. The growing scarcity of resources is almost a red herring, but if fear of running out of raw materials helps to change perceptions about waste, then all to the good. Waste has been built into business models for decades, but waste can be turned into wealth through keeping resources, components, products and services as economically viable for as long as possible. As with all innovation, the early adopters will gain the advantage.",South Africa,2019.06
162,Supply chain must shift to circular economies,"As consumer and shareholder preferences shift toward sustainability, chief supply chain officers (CSCOs) must prepare for the transformation from a linear to a circular supply chain without waste.

According to Gartner, by 2029, the circular economy will be the only economy, replacing wasteful linear economies.

Gartner defines the circular economy as an economic model that separates the ability to achieve economic growth from the consumption of natural resources.

Circular economic business models encourage continuous reuse of materials to minimise waste and the demand for additional natural resource consumption.

“Organisations are under pressure to reduce the amount of waste they’re producing – from consumers and governments alike,” says Steven Steutermann, managing vice-president in the Gartner Supply Chain practice. “The solution to this challenge is a shift towards a circular, waste-free economy.

“The supply chain will play a key role in this process. Eighty-four percent of participants in Gartner’s recent Supply Chain and the Circular Economy Survey stated that the supply chain has, or will have, decision-making authority when it comes to their organisation’s circular economy strategies and initiatives.”

Switching from a linear to a circular economy is not a go-it-alone project – it requires a whole ecosystem. CSCOs should collaborate with internal product designers and suppliers to understand exactly how products are consumed and disposed after consumption.

“To turn around a supply chain system, 10 years is not a long time. CSCOs should deploy change management programs and start pilots now,” adds Steutermann. “The pilots will provide valuable learnings and help build momentum for further circular economy initiatives.”

Another action to take is to join a consortium or alliance, such as Make Fashion Circular, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste or Loop, an online shopping concept designed to eliminate single-use packaging.

“Getting together with like-minded professionals will support CSCOs to sketch out a vision for an intelligent ecosystem of partners and peers,” Steutermann adds. “They should start with a single question, such as ‘How can I reduce packaging?’, and expand from there.”

According to the survey, the biggest challenge to circular-economy efforts is setting measurable goals.

Often, the key challenge in setting these goals – as with any transformational initiative – is substantiating how the proposed changes will impact consumer preferences and, ultimately, margins.

“While some metrics on sustainability already exist, they are mostly related to linear metrics, such as reducing waste to landfills or carbon dioxide emissions. It is important not to confuse those metrics with the circular economy,” Steutermann says.

“Good metrics for the circular economy could be the percentages of reclaimed, reused materials for production and the reduction of single-use plastic.”",South Africa,2019.09
189,UK marine litter scientists tackle pollution in SA,"Cape Town – Marine litter scientists from the UK kicked-off work in South Africa this week to tackle plastic pollution in the ocean in the hopes of reducing reliance on single-use plastics, improving waste management and moving towards a more circular economy for plastics. Experts from the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas), part of the UK government’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), have partnered with the South African government and research colleagues in the country to identify solutions to problems posed by marine litter. The Commonwealth Litter Programme (CLiP) launched with a community beach outreach event in Cape Town on Tuesday, where Cefas scientists demonstrated scientific monitoring techniques and held an exhibition on marine litter challenges and solutions. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex Prince Harry and Meghan, who are on a tour of South Africa, met Cefas’s principal marine litter scientist Thomas Maes during the event to hear more about the CLiP programme and approaches to tackling marine litter internationally. In recent years, the serious issue of marine litter and plastic pollution has been recognised by international governments and organisations, as well as local communities, as a growing threat to the marine environment and people’s livelihoods.

The programme is working with colleagues in the South African government, regional organisations, academia and community groups, to carry out scientific monitoring and to develop ideas and actions which support existing efforts and will enable them to further achieve their ambitions on tackling plastic pollution.

UK International Environment Minister Zac Goldsmith said: “It is fantastic to see world-leading UK scientists joining their Commonwealth counterparts and sharing expertise in the international fight to tackle the plastic waste that devastates our marine environment.”

Maes said the centre was delighted to be collaborating with government and other organisations.

“Cefas has international expertise and experience in marine litter science and policy which we are pleased to share with South Africa, and other partner nations, to help address the problem.”

South Africa is the fourth country to be involved in the CLiP work and the team will bring their experiences from the previous phases of the programme which took place in the two South Pacific island nations of Vanuatu and Solomon Islands, and more recently in Belize, in the Caribbean.

Scientists will be in the region until December, working with local colleagues and stakeholders to monitor litter, clean beaches, set up a microplastics laboratory and raise awareness of actions which can be taken.",South Africa,2019.09
329,Mining companies stand to benefit from circular economy – Rapson,"JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – As the circular economy grows, it poses a major risk for mining companies because, essentially, it means that people are reusing the same products over and over, thereby using less and less of the raw materials that are mined by mining companies, Webber Wentzel environment and natural resources partner Garyn Rapson points out.

Mining companies can, however, survive amid an increasing drive towards the circular economy if they listen to their customers.

Further, there were also potential benefits to operationalising the circular economy, he noted during a mining round-up event at the law firm’s offices, in Sandton, on Tuesday.

In doing so, mining companies will “be the winners” in the eyes of consumers in terms of the metals and materials they produce, while simultaneously creating a platform for economic benefits to operationalise on-site from projects.

This would be key, he added, since mining companies that operationalise the circular economy would be ahead of the curve as the global economy moves into a world post the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

“Not only will you be preferred from your customer’s perspective, but you will be able to generate revenue if you take some of these projects seriously,” Rapson highlighted.

He cautioned, however, that mining companies had to seek proper regulatory advice and ensure the right approvals and consents were in place, as that would form the foundation on which these projects could be implemented effectively.",South Africa,2019.09

479,Vanadium is essential for renewables in a circular economy,"Despite these drawbacks, lithium-ion batteries remain the best known available solution for consumer electronics and electric vehicles. However, in stationary storage, the more sustainable option is vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs).

A VRFB is designed to last for 20 years or more, meaning that fewer batteries need to be deployed than if lithium-ion ones were used. More important, the chemical electrolyte in the battery can be fully re-used once the electrical and mechanical components wear out.

The circularity of vanadium in energy storage is even more impressive when the scenario of redeploying the vanadium from the battery for other uses is considered. If there is no demand for new batteries, that electrolyte can be easily reprocessed by existing vanadium mining and processing facilities, at minimal cost, into products such as ferrovanadium and vanadium pentoxide for use in high-strength steels and speciality alloys and chemicals.

Two factors make vanadium electrolyte relatively easy to process. It is mostly water and only one mineral needs to be extracted — vanadium. Recycling a lithium-ion battery entails separating out lithium, nickel, manganite and cobalt among other minerals, which is a more complex, costly and energy-intensive process.

These characteristics currently make vanadium the most environmentally friendly, large-scale battery material in a circular economy.

For SA, this creates a massive opportunity in both the energy transition and the circular economy. This country has the largest high-grade deposits of vanadium in the world, so it can benefit from increased vanadium demand through mining. SA also processes most of its vanadium, and these processing plants can be used again in the future to reprocess vanadium electrolyte for other uses, regardless of whether the batteries themselves were deployed here or abroad. That means more jobs for today and in the future.

One of the hurdles in any recycling initiative is the logistics and costs associated with collecting waste, which can make recycling uneconomical. For example, the manufacturers of lead batteries have set up collection chains to take used batteries, but those costs are included in the end price.

For vanadium, a rental structure can be created. Instead of having to pay the full capital cost of a battery upfront — which is influenced by prevailing vanadium market prices — and be presented with the problem of disposing of it when it reaches the end of its life, the operator of the battery pays a smaller fee upfront followed by regular, ongoing rental payments.

Once the battery energy is exhausted, the vanadium can be redeployed into another battery or reprocessed for sale into the steel sector. This structure creates an incentive to recycle the batteries at an attractive cost to the end-user.

The responsibility of policy makers in a circular economy is to factor in the costs upfront for sustainable disposal (not just removal) of technologies that are difficult to re-use or recycle and overtly include this cost in tenders for projects. The carbon tax was recently introduced to address this type of cost for coal and gas. Policy makers also have the power to positively encourage technologies where sustainability is already proven, using tools such as preferential tax treatment or other incentives.",South Africa,2019.09
