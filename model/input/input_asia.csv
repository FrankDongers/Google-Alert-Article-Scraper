37,Will Indian Cities Start Paying for Bus Tickets With Plastic Bottles? Quite Possible!,"We live in a world which is mostly concentrated on make, use, and dispose. This, loosely referred to as linear economy, ensures that we walk towards an impending mass destruction of the planet where the natural habitats would be choking with plastic and other toxic industrial waste very soon.

However, all may not be lost after all. While many organisations follow the destructive path of a linear economy, growing awareness regarding the environment has led to the development of a concept called 'circular economy'.

Broadly speaking, a 'circular economy' model ensures that Earth's continually repleting natural resources are put to minimal use to sustain them for future generations It is not only limited to daily-use recycling products but goes deeper by attempting to ensure that organisations recreate products which can make their recycling easier or unnecessary. This model of economy would not only ensure less consumption of non-renewable resources but ensure their sustainability for future generations.

On Wednesday, Chairman of the Mahindra group, Anand Mahindra shared a video from the World Economic Forum which detailed the accounts of four cities that let the public pay for public transport with plastic waste.

Beijing allows commuters to pay for the metro ticket with plastic bottles at a special ticket machine. In an Indonesian city, buses accept payment through plastic bottles and not cash. In Surabaya, again in Indonesia, passengers pay with recycling and get two hours of travel. In Istanbul, meanwhile, people can exchange their plastic waste for credit on their metro cards which can be used on different forms of public transport. Sydney has high-tech reverse vending machines where recycling gets you rewards like movie tickets or bus tickets.

Talking about recycling laying the foundation for a circular economy, Mahindra wondered which Indian city would be the first to take a similar initiative, tagging Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Andhra Pradesh CM N. Chandrababu Naidu, asking them whether they would implement this model in Indore and Amravati respectively.



Thanking the chairman for his suggestion, CM Shivraj informed that the state of Madhya Pradesh does have several plastic bottle recycling machines, however, his (Mahindra) suggestion was a good idea and the CM promised to take this up in a future meeting.

Several other users too hailed the idea and even offered their suggestions.",India,2018.09
102,Full steam for circular parks plan,"Although a framework for the circular economy has yet to be finalised by the government, the Industry Ministry is keen on the plan that creates the Resource Recovery Parks as industrial estates for the circular economy.

Industry Minister Uttama Savanayana said the ministry will promote the Resource Recovery Parks on 1,000-rai plots managed by the state-run Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand (IEAT).

""The parks will be located in six regions across the country, and the IEAT will take charge of this project to determine the direction of the circular economy in the state industrial parks,"" Mr Uttama said. ""We will conclude specific directions soon.""

A circular economy is a regenerative system in which resource inputs and waste, emissions and energy leakage are minimised by slowing, closing and narrowing energy and material loops. This can be achieved through long-lasting design, maintenance, repair, reuse, remanufacturing, refurbishing, recycling and upcycling.

The government is promoting and supporting advanced technological development of 11 targeted industries -- cars; smart electronics; affluent, medical and wellness tourism; agriculture and biotechnology; food; robotics for industry; logistics and aviation; biofuels and biochemicals; digital; medical services; and defence.

The circular economy concept will soon be in the 12th targeted industry plan, but it has to receive cabinet approval first.

Mr Uttama said the IEAT will cooperate with the Industrial Works Department to utilise waste to supply the new industrial estates.

Many state agencies are working on the circular economy concept, such as the Office of Industrial Economics and the Board of Investment, to come up with a roadmap, strategy and investment incentives for the project.

Mr Uttama said the ministry has ordered the IEAT to set up a small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) and Industry Transformation Centre (SMEs-ITC Centre) to support and promote SMEs and startups in 13 provincial areas.

""The IEAT will also support 450 communities, covering 180,000 people surrounding industrial estates to create new products from waste for commercial purposes,"" Mr Uttama said.

Separately, the ministry plans to revise the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand Act of 1979 to adjust some sections to accommodate the upcoming changes, the process for which is under consultation with the Office of the Council of State.

Somchint Pilouk, IEAT's governor, said the terms of reference (ToR) for the third phase of the Map Ta Phut seaport, worth 47.9 billion baht, will be proposed to the cabinet meeting for acknowledgment and approval on Oct 30.

The ToR will be issued to interested companies at the beginning of November.

""This megaproject has drawn interest from PTT Plc, Italian-Thai Development Plc and Ch.Karnchang Plc,"" Ms Somchint said.

Taiwan’s CTCI Foundation, in association with Taiwan Institute for Sustainable Energy and Center for Corporate Sustainability, produced the event, which revolved around four major themes, including developing green technology for a circular economy and promoting green economy business models.

Chairman Eugene Chien (簡又新) thanked the organizers and foreign guests for making their way to Taipei in order to attend the conference. He went on to highlight Taiwan’s substantive progress in waste reduction over the past 30 years.

Representative of the Netherlands Trade & Investment Office, Guy Wittich, noted that Taiwan has made huge strides towards facilitating a circular economy over the past few years. He commented, however, that the government also ought to put both incentives and legal restrictions in place to ensure big industry gets in line with Taiwan’s goals.

The representative noted that the Netherlands is looking to implement legislation to restrict the use of new materials in production. He suggested that Taiwan think more about working multilaterally with other states to implement circular economy strategy. He further expressed hope that Dutch experts in the field can be in attendance next year.",Taiwan,2018.10
188,The circular economy: a solution to climate c...,"Attendees of the 2018 International Conference on Solutions for a Circular Economy Attendees of the 2018 International Conference on Solutions for a Circular Economy (Taiwan News photo)

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — At the 2018 International Conference on Integrated and Innovative Solutions for a Circular Economy in Taipei today, several specialists offered their expertise on how we can move towards implementing a fully circular economy.

The term “circular economy” is relatively self-descriptive. A traditional (linear) economy follows a singular path from production through usage to disposal and has been the default market driver in the developed world for hundreds of years. A circular economy aims to create a cycle whereby used goods and materials are put back into production or usage, thereby slowing, closing and narrowing material and energy loops.

UK charity The Ellen MacArthur Foundation provides the most renowned definition of the term: “an industrial economy that is restorative or regenerative by intention and design.”

According to a landmark UN report published earlier this month, we have only 12 years to change our behavior in order to limit a climate change catastrophe. 12 years is the estimated time it will take for global temperatures to rise by 1.5 C, above which Antarctic ice sheets will reach a tipping point and begin to cause “unstoppable multi-meter sea level rises”, drastically increasing coastal flooding risks and potentially subjecting millions to climate-related poverty.

While many reports remain pessimistic, some experts believe we are still not at a complete loss, and making drastic changes in our lifestyle and production habits now can prevent disaster. According to specialists at today’s international conference, fully adopting a circular economy is exactly the change we need to make.

The process of moving towards a sustainable future requires making changes on both a personal and global level.

Seoul University’s Professor Hyunook Kim detailed the immense efforts the Korean government has gone through to encourage its citizens to take up more sustainable recycling and waste disposal practices. Authorities have implemented strict regulations that include washing waste containers before recycling them, with transgressors fined up to US$300.

Of course, Taiwan has itself successfully introduced pragmatic responses to waste management problems over the past 20 years. But today, Professor Jiří Jaromír Klemeš of Brno University of Technology, Czech Republic, warned that currently, too much focus is put on recycling rather than reusing.

Recycling provides a solution but does not eradicate the root cause of waste. The academic reminded that recycling glass bottles rather than reusing them wastes an enormous amount of energy. Incinerators require huge energy inputs to function, and much of this currently comes from non-renewable sources.

People all over the world still need to undergo huge psychological and sociological changes, he further commented. Professor Klemeš laments that increasing GDP each year remains a central target in countries that already have enough to provide for their citizens. Higher GDPs encourage more wasteful consumption; more meat, bigger cars and bigger houses.

Individuals cannot be held entirely responsible for their consumption habits, though. The biggest driver of wasteful consumption is the capitalist market.

More must be done by national authorities to ensure industries are not encouraging negligent behavior. This includes everything from mitigating the absurd overpackaging of supermarket products to regulating the mass-production of electronics with no tangible way to dismantle, reuse or recycle their component parts.

Science and technology also have their roles to play in encouraging regenerative and restorative practices, Director of Argonne National Laboratory Dr. Norman D. Peterson expressed in his presentation.

In the U.S., 40% of total energy demands come from residential and commercial buildings. Peterson explained that buildings can be made “smarter” via integrating self-healing materials and cyber-physical intelligence systems with sensors to prevent inefficient equipment usage and energy waste. Such technology can even be retrofitted into existing buildings in a cost-effective manner.

Circular development projects must remember not to be exclusive, however. Patrick Schröder of the Institute of Development Studies at Sussex University (UK) insisted that discussions of circular development must include social and ethical concerns. Businesses need to place additional considerations on the needs of low and middle-income countries.

Labor automation, for example, can provide effective opportunities to reduce waste created by traditional manufacturing methods. But this transformation may also block development pathways in low and middle-income countries through “premature deindustrialization”.

When countries lose their manufacturing jobs before they become wealthy, workers can shift from highly productive industries to small-scale operations like shopkeeping in order to continue making a living. Governments and industries must work together to ensure proper infrastructure is in place to prevent this.

These considerations are especially important when looking forward to the future. Over the past 70 years, population demographics have shifted rapidly in Asia. Many countries in the region have followed traditional industrial development paths to become what we now consider “developed” nations.

The next region set for a drastic population boom is Africa, according to Professor Klemeš. However, the world simply cannot afford for the region to follow the same development path as its predecessors.

Discovering, financing and implementing circular solutions should not be the burden of African nations, however. The Western world and many Asian countries had the privilege of utilizing their vast non-renewable energy sources to support their industrial development.

For Africa, this is not an option anymore, and so it is imperative that states work multilaterally with each other and industries to ensure viable options for circular development are available to everyone.

The biggest takeaway from today’s conference was that it is not too late to save the earth. Dramatically adjusting production methods and consumption habits can have a significant enough impact to halt the forces of climate change.

While encouraging citizens to eat less meat, buy fewer clothes, and reuse and recycle more will have a significant impact, the problem is much bigger. Mutual trust, understanding and cooperation is needed between the state and private sector to fully implement a circular economy.

Industry and governments must work in tandem to ensure sustainable production practices are adhered to, and newly developing economies are not left in the dark.",Taiwan,2018.10
203,Royal DSM recognised for efforts in sustainability in Top Green Companies in Asia award,"Royal DSM, a global science-based company active in nutrition, health and sustainable living, has been awarded the Top Green Companies in Asia Award at the 2018 Asia Corporate Excellence & Sustainability (ACES) Awards.

The awards recognise successful companies and individuals in Asia in the key areas of leadership and corporate social responsibility, the company said in a press statement on October 12, 2018.

“We are a science based company that is purpose led, seeking ways to qualitatively change the lives of people for the better,” said Pieter Nuboer, Vice President, Animal Nutrition and Health, and President, DSM Nutritional Products, Asia Pacific.

“Bringing sustainable applications of science to consumers at large is at the heart of our purpose and is truly embedded in our DNA. This recognition today, as we continue to grow our impact in Asia, is particularly welcome.”

In presenting the award, judges highlighted DSM as a purpose-led company whose business operations yield positive impact on the environment, community and society.

For 14 years, DSM was ranked among the global leaders in the materials industry group of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. In 2018, the company took a spot on Fortune Magazine’s ‘Change the World’ List for the third consecutive year, among 57 companies that induced positive social impact through activities that are part of their core business strategy. DSM was also named on Forbes’s list of The World’s Most Sustainable Companies in 2017.

To promote good nutrition among its employees, DSM serves lunch meals that include fortified rice kernels enhanced with essential micronutrients to its factory workers at its Malaysia Premix Plant. In Singapore, these fortified rice kernels are also distributed by DSM through social enterprise 45RICE, to help address nutritional challenges of migrant workers.

222,Going full circle: Why recycling isn't enough,"Next week, more than 1,000 people from across sectors will gather in Yokohama to discuss how to capitalize on the economic, social, and environmental benefits of a circular economy. This gathering, the World Circular Economy Forum, is unique because it brings together key players in business and industry — not just policymakers and academics — to spark the creation of practical solutions that are both good for the environment and good for business.

The circular economy concept is gaining popularity as a means to achieve more sustainable cities and societies. The world is projected to be home to 10 billion people by the middle of this century. That’s 2.5 billion more than today, when we are already straining available natural resources. What’s more, the world’s cities now generate roughly 2 billion tons of solid waste and this is forecast to grow by 70 percent in 2050.

This paints a frighteningly unsustainable and untenable picture of the future. So, what is a circular economy and how can it help?

The traditional economy of consumption is linear: we “take” natural resources to “make” things for our use, and then “trash” the leftovers. A circular economy focuses on reducing the “take” and the “trash” by optimizing the use of materials already removed from nature.

Most efforts to achieve a circular economy — including in Japan — have so far focused primarily on the “trash” part of the circle, through recycling and waste management efforts. While this is important, it’s only half of what is needed. The other, equally important half must focus on the “take”: reducing the amount of materials that we remove from nature in the first place.

From a natural resources perspective, the biggest problem with the traditional model is our ability to take from nature with no limits. As long as we can continue to extract more oil, and make more plastic (as one example), we will continue to do so.

Humans typically don’t take things seriously until we face limits. The only way to ensure a successful circular economy, therefore, will be to introduce strict legal boundaries to limit the exploitation of our finite natural resources. While we are adept at misusing our freedoms, we are also good at finding innovative alternatives when limits are introduced.

Take Singapore, for example. It is one of the most water-stressed countries in the world — facing extreme limits in the amount of water available for consumption and use. To overcome this, it implemented the NEWater project to effectively capture and treat wastewater for reuse as drinking water.

Rwanda, the Netherlands, and the United States also offer compelling examples of how societies adapt well to imposed limits.

When Rwanda banned the use of plastic bags in 2008, a new industry manufacturing biodegradable bags bloomed and flourished. Ten years later, the country is now the leading biodegradable bag manufacturer in the region. When the Dutch government announced plans in 2017 to virtually ban all petrol- and diesel-powered cars by 2030, electrical vehicle sales surged. And when Seattle became the first major U.S. city to ban single-use plastic straws, demand soared for compostable and reusable straws.

“Circular economy” is now a buzzword catching attention in the international community, but we still have a long way to go to understand the full meaning of the concept. Efforts to recycle and reuse materials should continue unabated, but more attention must be focused on reducing the initial “take” by introducing strict legal boundaries.

Societies around the world have already proven that these limits will be met with innovation and ingenuity and will result in a more sustainable future for all.

One hopes the upcoming Word Circular Economy Forum in Yokohama will provide a platform to strengthen the concept and implementation of a truly circular economy by shedding light on the full circle.

225,Creating the virtuous circle,"A sustainable economic model based on recycling, remanufacturing and reuse is gaining adherents around the globe and in Thailand.

While a growing population and robust economic growth rate are desired by many, the consequences of such drastic developments can take a toll on society and the environment, as seen through rising pollution, rampant poverty and resource scarcity.

With the future edging closer as an unsustainable black hole, a model is being developed to provide mankind with a glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel.

A circular economy is a regenerative system in which resource inputs and waste, emissions and energy leakage are minimised by slowing, closing and narrowing energy and material loops. This can be achieved through long-lasting design, maintenance, repair, reuse, remanufacturing, refurbishing, recycling and upcycling.

A circular economy differs from a linear economy, which has a ""take, make, dispose"" model of production.

This economic concept can solve natural resource problems and improve the environment and social sustainability, said Industry Minister Uttama Savanayana.

Under the S-curve policy, the circular economy will be applied to 11 targeted industries, as the ministry believes that the model can bring about economic sustainability in the long run, in line with global trends.

Nattapol Rangsitpol, director-general of the Office of Industrial Economics (OIE), said the circular economy will increase competitiveness and efficiency and add value to Thailand's industrial sector.

The circular economy for Thailand will focus on reducing raw materials, strengthening durability at operational plants, upgrading technology and creating innovation for higher efficiency.

""With reused and recycled products instead of using new resources, every industrial operator should comply with the government's circular economy because of the benefits to society and the environment,"" Mr Nattapol said.

Circular economies can deliver financial growth while being environmentally and socially responsible. For instance, they can dramatically cut carbon emissions, said Venkatachalam Anbumozhi, senior energy economist at the Economic Research Institute for Asean and East Asia (Eria).

Eria has analysed circular opportunities in cities and particularly in the manufacturing, agriculture and forestry sectors across Asia.

According to Eria, the adoption of circular economy principles could lead to economic growth of US$324 billion and create 1.5 million jobs in those cities and sectors in Asia over the next 25 years.

Germany is among the leaders of the concept. The waste management industry in the country generated about 200,000 jobs in 2016, with money circulating in the economic system worth more than €40 billion, according to think tanks.

China has also increased the use and recycling of waste products, with its promotion of rubber tyre recycling an outstanding example, Eria said. In the light of increased waste from the rapidly expanding transport sector, the Chinese government in 2008 provided a VAT exemption to all businesses that retreaded old tyres or produced rubber powder from used tyres.

With such positive prospects, the Industry Ministry last month announced a promotion of newly targeted industries as part of the circular economy initiative.

Mr Uttama said the government is concerned about how industrial development will have an impact on society and the environment; therefore the government wants to promote the circular economy concept as a guideline for the private sector to follow.

The ministry has ordered the OIE to come up with a strategy and roadmap for the circular economy, together with requesting Board of Investment (BoI) cooperation on designing a package of investment privileges.

""The ministry expects the roadmap and strategy to be completed within October,"" Mr Uttama said. ""Once they receive government approval, the cabinet will assess the plans before concluding the final approval.""

The circular economy is a concept that can potentially help solve problems associated with scarcity of natural resources, subsequently inducing social and environmental sustainability.

At present, the government is promoting and supporting advanced technological development of 11 targeted industries: cars; smart electronics; affluent, medical and wellness tourism; agriculture and biotechnology; food; robotics for industry; logistics and aviation; biofuels and biochemicals; digital; medical services; and defence.

The circular economy concept has been known throughout the private sector for at least three years, embraced by leading businesses such as Siam Cement Group, Indorama Ventures and PTT.

Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak said state agencies and the private sector alike should pay more attention to the circular economy because environmental concerns have become a global issue affecting citizens all over the world.

According to Mr Somkid, the government has already tasked the Industry Ministry and the BoI with studying investment privileges for projects involved with environmental protection and social development, in compliance with the 20-year National Strategy (2018-38) and ongoing social and economic reforms.

Under the 20-year plan, the government aims to narrow the widening income disparity gap to 15 times from the current 20. The plan particularly focuses on the richest 10% and poorest 10% in Thailand.

""I have already instructed the BoI to study investment privileges for projects involved with environment protection and social development,"" Mr Somkid said. ""But more importantly, the circular economy and environmental concern should be instilled not only in businesses, but also younger generations and Thai society as a whole.""

State policies and incentives, however, usually take quite a long time to jump-start, Mr Somkid said, citing how the digital economy initiative has taken about three years to attract interest from the public and businesses.

It will be much better if Thai society learns to protect and conserve environmental well-being, he said.

Besides reducing the use of new raw materials in production plants and product recycling, upgrading technology to create new innovations for maximising efficiency is part of the circular economy concept.

Richard Jones, vice-president and head of investor relations at IVL, a maker of polyester and plastic packaging material, said the circular economy is a model to build economic, natural and social capital.

The concept is based on three principles: waste and pollution control; keeping products and materials in use; and regenerating the natural system.

""IVL is ready to support the government policy that wants to promote the circular economy in the 11 targeted industries in Thailand,"" Mr Jones said. ""The company believes that it will be a success in the future because the government can push forward this initiative faster than the private sector.

""The company has moved forward towards becoming a global leader in manufacturing 100% recyclable polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles and other sustainable materials.""

At present, IVL has operations in 29 countries worldwide, with 85 petrochemical plants in the Asia-Pacific region, the US and Europe, along with 11 research and development centres. The company reported total revenue of US$8.4 billion in 2017.

The globally diversified portfolio of IVL manufacturing plants accounts for the company's total production capacity of 14.5 million tonnes per year.

With concerns over rising plastic waste, IVL has built the first of its recycling facilities in Nakhon Pathom province, a greenfield project with a capacity of 29,000 tonnes per year.

The facility is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reusing plastic waste and recycling used PET bottles for the production of polyester fibres and filaments.

The recycled products from this site also serve end markets for packaging, fabrics, fillings and non-woven textiles and industrial products.

At present, IVL has large-scale capacity to recycle 350,000 tonnes of PET bottles per year in Europe.

""Thailand's PET recycle plant exports PET recycle products to Europe because it has a strong demand-driven growth in the European market,"" Mr Jones said. ""On the other hand, the domestic market still has no demand in the commercial market.""

But Thailand has more opportunities for PET recycling and adopting the circular economy concept, he said.

""We hope Thailand can be a leading exporter for PET recycling and can facilitate commercial sales in Thailand as well,"" Mr Jones said. ""Thailand has a strong position in food and tourism, so these sectors can expand demand for PET recycling products.""

One snag: selling recycled PET products to food and drink companies in Thailand is illegal under Department of Industrial Works regulations, as the department does not approve such products for use as packaging.

""It is a conflict between the law and circular PET recycling products,"" Mr Jones said. ""The government should solve this problem.""

Another Thai petrochemical giant is conducting a feasibility study of building a plant for recycling PET bottles in an attempt to push forward the circular economy concept.

""We are seeking a business partner who is interested in investing in a circular economy business,"" said Warawan Tippawanich, senior vice-president for corporate affairs at PTT Global Chemical Plc (PTTGC).

At present, the company is turning used PET bottles into textile products and even making T-shirts from discarded bottles.

A tonne of PET bottles can yield roughly 5,000 T-shirts, according to Ms Warawan.

""PTTGC has partnered with local people and a provincial administration in Koh Samet in Rayong province, where the company has a petrochemical production plant,"" she said. ""PET bottles used around the island and dumped in the sea are collected to produce T-shirts, which we give to charity and sports groups.""

PTTGC plans to expand its model to other areas to collect used PET bottles and plastic waste to supply the recycling plant in the future.

Thammasak Jittimaporn, vice-chairman of the Thailand Management Association, said businesses should move towards achieving the UN General Assembly's sustainable development goals.

Businesses should share ideas and reveal key insights on how to apply technology and innovation to develop approaches helping to maintain sustainable global development, Mr Thammasak said.

The circular economy is a global trend and has been known among Thai businesses for a few years, he said, and the concept of applying zero waste and circular economy for businesses and industries appeals to the private sector.",Thailand,2018.10
232,E-Waste Day: 82% of India's e-waste is personal devices,"The first International E-Waste Day is being celebrated across 20 countries by 40 different organisations worldwide to raise awareness on e-waste issues, collection, recycling

It is estimated that 50 million tonne of e-waste will be generated globally in 2018. Half of this is personal devices such as computers, screens, smartphones, tablets and TVs, with the remainder being larger household appliances and heating and cooling equipment. Out of this, only 20 per cent of global e-waste is recycled each year, which means that 40 million tonnes of e-waste is either placed in landfill, burned or illegally traded and treated in a sub-standard way. This is despite 66 per cent of the world’s population being covered by e-waste legislation.

Many identify consumers as the key to better management of e-waste. This initiative aims to encourage consumers to correctly dispose their e-waste, with increased reuse and recycling rates and adopt sustainable consumer habits to move towards a circular economy.

In India, the lack of an updated inventory of e-waste generated makes it difficult to quantify the e-waste recycled and disposed. According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s comprehensive inventory from 2005, India was to generate 0.8 million tonne of e-waste by 2010.

However, a few independent studies suggest that the generation of e-waste could be much higher. The Global E-Waste Monitor, 2017 published by the United Nations University estimated that India generates about 2 million metric tonnes of e-waste (2016) annually. Nearly 82 per cent of this is personal devices.

India is ranked 5th in the world among top e-waste producing countries-USA, China, Japan and Germany. “The large increase (in total e-waste generation of the world) was mainly attributed to India,” said the report. An ASSOCHAM-KPMG study, Electronic Waste Management in India identified computer equipment account for almost 70 per cent of e-waste, followed by telecommunication equipment-phones (12 per cent), electrical equipment (8 per cent) and medical equipment (7 per cent) with remaining from household e-waste.

This increase in quantity of e-waste is because of increased consumption but also obsolescence. Users discard old computers, mobiles and other equipment much faster than before. According to a study in May 2017, the volume of waste is growing at an estimated 21 per cent annually. This report predicts that by 2020, e-waste from old computers in India will increase by 500 per cent; from discarded mobile phones will be about 18 times higher; from televisions will be 1.5 to 2 times higher; from discarded refrigerators will be double; than their respective 2007 levels.

On 1 October 2016, the newly launched E-waste (Management) Rules 2016 replaced the existing E-waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2011. The concept of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) mandated producers of electrical and electronic equipment to register and specified targets to collect back e-waste generated and to ensure that it is channelised to authorized recyclers. In March 2018, the E-waste (Management) Amended Rules reduced the target to 10 per cent for 2016-17 (as against 20 per cent), 20 per cent for 2017-18 (remains same). This target progressively goes up to 70 per cent in the seventh year.

The penalty and punishment for non-compliance were the same as sections 15, 16 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The sections specify an imprisonment term that may extend to five years or a fine which may extend to Rs 1 lakh would be the penalty for non-compliance.

EPR authorisation has been provided to 726 producers by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) as on 12 October 2018. The authorisation, which is valid for a period of five years from the date of issue, specifies the collection targets for the specified time (five years). However, the CPCB website reports the target achieved or any penalty imposed for noncompliance.The random checking provision provided by the rules are not utilised for, in addition, no independent mechanism in place to check or verify the claims made in authorisations. The robust rules are flailed by slack implementation.

The problem of e-waste has been spoken about in some levels, but not at a large enough scale to make a considerable impact, especially in the unorganised sector. E-waste if stored and not dismantled is not hazardous in nature. The problem lies in improper handling. Unfortunately, India is still ill-equipped in skilled labour to handle e-waste recycling. Only 1.5 per cent of e-waste generated in India gets recycled. Zero awareness about e-waste and its recycling, as well as the role of the unorganised sector are the added challenges to the problem.The base metals which can be reused are lost and results soil contamination due to unorganised and crude dismantling.

A consumer of an electric or electronic device is not apprised of the end of value chain of the product. No information is provided along with the product packing about the e-collection centre for the product sold. The responsibility of the consumers is not specified along with the product. The deposit refund scheme (DRS) that aids the recycling of the product is not available in India.

“Considering the India’s e-waste generation estimates and the lax of capacity with the urban local bodies, the future doesn’t look bright. The rules mandate an individual to drop the e-waste at an authorised collector, but do not provide any incentive against it. This forces e-waste to end up with informal sector and loses track on further recycling,” says Sonia Garga, Project Manager, Sahaas Zero Waste, a startup that converts waste into resources.",India,2018.10
233,Harsh Vardhan says plant made in Dehradun will convert e-waste into bio fuel,"Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan said Saturday a plant to convert plastic waste into bio-diesel will soon be made operational at the Indian Institute of Petroleum (IIP) in Dehradun.

He was speaking at the International E-Waste Day event organised by the International Finance Corporation (IFC).

""The plant has been set up at Dehradun and it will be operational by January end. The facility, which will be run on a pilot basis, is capable of converting plastic waste into bio-diesel. The model will then be replicated across the country,"" Vardhan said.

The plant has the capacity to convert one tonne of plastic waste into 800 litres biofuel which will be of highest quality and it can be used in any diesel automotive vehicle, according to a government official.

Vardhan said the whole country was concerned about the problem of e-waste and the government had amended the existing rules to ensure better management of e-waste and bio-medical waste through revised targets.

As per the Global E-Waste Monitor 2017 Report of United National University, the world generation of e-waste in 2016 was 44.7 million metric tonnes and the annual generation of e-waste in India was 2 million metric tonnes.

""Therefore, the contribution of India to the worldwide generation of e-waste is 4.47 per cent. We are neck deep into the problem and we have already have got the rules amended in 2018 based on discussions with the industry and other stakeholders.

""On behalf of our prime minister, we can promise to the whole world that like many other fields in the environment... we will certainly try to do our best on e-waste front,"" he said.

He also urged those present at the event to build a social movement around 'Green Good Deeds'- an initiative of the Environment Ministry and make it successful like the 'Pulse Polio' campaign.

The ministry has drawn up a list of over 500 deeds to motivate and involve the masses in environment protection. It mainly focuses on altering the behaviour to make it nature-friendly, he said.

On the occasion, Japan's Ambassador to India Kenji Hiramatsu, ""I congratulate IFC on the successful implementation of its India E-waste Advisory Project, and I am pleased to inform that Government of Japan has been supporting this project through the Comprehensive Japan Trust Fund since 2014.

""I hope that this project would continue to contribute to the implementation of the E-waste policy in India,"" he said.

He also spoke about the importance of promoting a circular economy to achieve the goal of a sustainable society.

E-waste is the world's fastest growing waste stream and India is the fourth largest e-waste producer. At present around 95 per cent of the waste is processed by the informal sector, using practices harmful to their health and the environment.

Half of the e-waste generated globally is from personal devices such as computers, screens, smartphones, tablets and televisions, with the remainder being larger household appliances and heating and cooling equipment.",India,2018.10
235,"Interview: Sino-Dutch partnership gains new momentum, says Chinese ambassador - Xinhua | English.news.cn","THE HAGUE, Oct. 13 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming official visit by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang to the Netherlands will inject new impetus into the comprehensive cooperative partnership between the two countries, Chinese Ambassador to the Netherlands Wu Ken has said.

It's the first time that Li is paying an official visit to the Netherlands as Chinese premier. The last time a Chinese premier visited the country was 14 years ago.

""The two governments will further strengthen dialogue and integrate development strategies to foster new growth points for cooperation,"" Wu told Xinhua in a recent interview, saying it will certainly bring opportunities and instill new energy into Sino-Dutch relations.

In 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping chose the Netherlands as the first stop of his first European tour since taking office. Xi's visit has laid a solid foundation for the Sino-Dutch comprehensive cooperative partnership that stresses openness and pragmatism, and marked a historic high in bilateral relations, Wu said.

The ambassador said China is currently the second-largest trading partner of the Netherlands outside the European Union (EU) and the Netherlands is China's third-largest trading partner within the EU. In 2017, their bilateral trade volume hit 78.6 billion U.S. dollars, setting a new record in history.

The Netherlands' direct investment in China reached 2.1 billion dollars in 2017, taking a lead within the EU, while Chinese investment in the Netherlands was also at the top within the EU bloc with 22 billion dollars by the end of 2017.

The Netherlands now hosts some 10,000 Chinese students and three Confucius Institutes, and receives over 350,000 Chinese tourists every year.

Citing a popular saying among Chinese netizens, Wu said Sino-Dutch cooperation is ""fully charged with positive energy.""

He said Sino-Dutch relations are at an all-time high, enjoying the geographic benefits of being linked with the ancient Maritime Silk Road, and seeing the aspirations of the governments, enterprises and peoples of both countries to enhance cooperation and exchanges.

The willingness of the European country to participate in the Belt and Road construction is particularly impressive, said Wu.

As a ""gateway to Europe"" and an important hub on the Belt and Road, the Netherlands has had its Eurasian connectivity further extended in recent years thanks to the continuous growth of Asian trade volume at the Port of Rotterdam, direct flights linking Amsterdam and seven Chinese cities and railway cargo expresses linking Rotterdam-Tilburg-Chengdu.

""What we have achieved demonstrates the potential of opportunity and benefit with the development of the Belt and Road. We can do more, especially in industry and technology cooperation, in e-commerce, in circular economy and in third-party markets,"" said Wu.

The Chinese diplomat viewed the cooperation in science and technology as well as innovation as particularly promising.

""Let's combine 'Dutch design' and 'Made in China.' We can upgrade the cooperation in new energy, new material, biomedicine, environmental protection, smart city, etc. We can explore joint industrial parks or incubators, joint industrial investment, trading in technology or joint training, for example,"" he said.

""E-commerce also presents huge potential as online consumption is growing rapidly in the Netherlands and leading Chinese companies in this field are very interested in entering the Dutch market. Making the Netherlands a European e-commerce center will strongly support the growth of bilateral trade,"" Wu added.

On cooperation in circular economy, Wu said he expects new growth points.

""The Dutch are strong in green growth; we Chinese are eager for a greener life. Cooperation in this field will offer not only a bigger market for Dutch enterprises, and a better life for the Chinese people, but also best practices for the sustainability of the whole world,"" he said.",China,2018.10
242,Italy has what it takes to become leader in circular economy: report - Xinhua | English.news.cn,"ROME, Oct. 12 (Xinhua) -- Italy has what it takes to become a leader in the circular economy sector, according to a report presented here Friday by CENSIS social and economic think tank.

A circular economy is based on a model that reduces and/or eliminates waste, recycles used materials, and places value on the longevity of consumer products, making them last as long as possible, according to Italian news agency AGI, which is owned by Italian oil and gas giant ENI and which co-wrote the report with CENSIS.

The report was presented at the 6th edition of the three-day European Maker Faire, which kicked off Friday in Rome.

The Maker Faire describes itself as a showcase ""for inventions and innovation open to all forms of applied creativity... from new technologies to traditional 'know how' and handicraft."" Sectors include design, electronics, robotics, 3-D printing, health and quality of life, art, drones, energy, sustainability, and open sources.

Speaking at the inauguration of the Maker Faire, ENI CEO Claudio Descalzi called on Italian entrepreneurs to jump in to the circular economy by providing his multinational company with industrial waste that can be used to generate energy.

""We don't have direct access to waste,"" Descalzi said in a televised speech. ""There has to be a chain of business providers that select the waste -- whether organic or inorganic -- and then sell it to us.""

""This will add further upside to the circular economy,"" Descalzi told participants.

""There are hundreds of entrepreneurs here whose core business is transformation, recycling, and innovation. Today, ENI officially begins working with these issues, and wants to work with start-ups ... to create this new chain of circular production that can bring ENI, in a country such as Italy with no raw materials, to exploit the energy that can be obtained from waste.""

Italy is the lowest consumer of raw materials in Europe, with 8.5 tonnes per capita compared to a European average of 13.5 tonnes per capita, and it is among the best at extracting value from resources used: 3.34 euros per kilo of resources, against a European average of 2.2 euros per kilo, according to the CENSIS-AGI report.

Italy also scores high in terms of waste recycling: of 129 million tonnes of industrial waste generated per year, just 21 percent goes to landfills, compared to a European average of 49 percent. It also recycles 76.9 percent of its treated industrial waste (against Europe's 36.2 percent).

The recycling industry in Italy involves 10,500 companies that employ about 133,000 people, and produces an estimated 12.6 billion euros in added value, or 1 percent of national gross domestic product (GDP), according to the report.",China,2018.10

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) – Taiwanese circular economy design company Miniwiz (小智研發) is nominated for the U.K.’s Beazley Designs of the Year 2018 awards, for the company’s solar-powered recycling plant that transforms plastic bottles into housing tiles.

Miniwiz’s plastic upcycling plant called “Trashpresso” was nominated in the “product” category for its repurposing of plastic bottles into housing tiles, using only the power of the sun.

The Trashpresso project is the world’s first mobile recycling station and has been on the road since April 2017, featuring at events in China, Italy and the U.K. The project hopes to promote the circular economy and to inspire people through new approaches to recycling, according to its official website.

Trashpresso breaks down, purifies, and reshapes what would otherwise be plastic waste in a fashion which creates minimal waste, and is wholly powered by solar panels. Trashpresso can produce a wide-range of products including building modules, consumer goods, and furniture.

Trashpresso’s hexagon housing tile caught the eye of the judging panel of the Beazley Designs of the Year.

Each hexagon tile is made of either five plastic bottles, or 50 caps and ringlets.

Miniwiz was founded by Taiwanese structural engineer and architect Arthur Huang (黃謙智) in 2005, to develop environmentally friendly design and solutions based on the circular economy.

Huang told CNA that he focused his energy on environmentally friendly design for the last 15 years, and there are still many things to do in the future.

Huang suggested the speed of environmental reform in Taiwan is good, and that Taiwan is full of talented people in this space.

The Beazley Designs of the Year are curated by the Design Museum in London, which features architectural, fashion, graphic, and industrial design. This year’s design awards have nominated 87 projects across six categories.

More than 60 finalists will be showcased at the museum from Sept. 11 2018 to Jan. 6 2019, and the winners will be announced on Nov. 15.",Taiwan,2018.10
328,Kapok | Not so fantastic anymore,"One of my fellow columnists with the Times has made the fight against the abusive usage of plastic an all-out effort, very often taking a very personal tone. Contrary to the Belgium song, plastic is not that fantastic anymore and we should actually be considering totally banning it from our life. If Plastic Free July is such a great initiative, it is so not only because it strikingly demonstrates that we can “easily” do without the convenience of organic polymers — cheap, malleable and resistant, and yet awfully and irremediably polluting — but that recycling is not enough and what needs to change is our social and economic behavior at large.

In a ground-breaking study published in Sciences Advances in July 2017, a group of researchers was able to estimate that humanity had produced some 6,3 billion metric tons of plastic waste since 1950, and that only 9% of these had effectively been recycled, 12% incinerated, and no less than a staggering 79% accumulated in landfills or the natural environment. By 2025, the cumulative recycling rate should amount to 20%, and projecting the current global waste management trends, even though we will be able to recycle some 44% of our plastic waste by 2050, by then we will have also accumulated some 12 billion metric tons of discarded plastic waste scattered in the midst of mother nature!

The image of a straw stuck in the nose of a turtle might provide a terrific imagination grabber targeted at five-year-olds and their hurried parents — our era oscillates between the empathy for the cute and the indifference to barbarity — but as a more politicized journalist recently remarked: “Coca Cola produces on its own some 128 billion plastic bottles per year! When put one on top of the other, these bottles amount to one hundred times the distance from the Earth to the Moon…” Even though some countries are doing better than others — Norway already recycles 43.4% of its plastic waste — it is indisputable that the ability to recycle everything we manufacture is everything but a chimeric dream. Sorry for all the new evangelists of circular economy, but the future lies in reducing the amount of filth we are dropping on the green planet!

I was thus very proud when on October 2 the French National Assembly approved the law banning single-usage plastic “cutlery, meat picks, box covers, trays, ice-cream pots, salad cups, boxes and stirrers” by January 1 2020. This list complements the cotton sticks and single usage plastic glasses, cups and plates which were already destined to be axed by that date. Fifty micron thick plastic bags had already been removed from cashiers as well as fruits and vegetables stalls respectively in 2016 and 2017. But then, France only recycles 22.2% of its plastic waste and one could argue that being an advanced economy, it had had plenty of time to pollute without really caring.

However, I just came back from India, and guess what? Twenty-five out the country’s twenty-nine states have already put in place various bans on the manufacture, supply, storage and use of plastics! India’s Environment Minister has already announced that by 2022, his country would “eliminate all single use plastics.” In Mumbai, 225 municipal civil servants dressed in purple have been tracking offenders to the law since June 2018, and if this does not sound almighty in a city of 21 million dwellers, those confronted to fines ranging from Rs5,000 (half a median monthly salary) to Rs25,000 for recidivists seem to be taking the scheme seriously, be them manufacturers, distributors or consumers. In Goa, the manufacturing of 50 micron and thinner plastic bags has actually been prohibited by law since 2016, and even political parties have been made responsible for managing the waste generated by their campaign activities!

In Macao, civic groups are mobilizing and taking stock of the filthy wasteful habits registered in the SAR, but why would the territory be left to the goodwill of a few casinos, even with the best of intentions? Is a gold-plated plastic landfill our only horizon?",Macao,2018.10
330,"SCG Hosts “SD Day 2018”, Inspiring Sustainable Resource Usage and Driving Circular Economy Network in Rayong","The COVID-19 crisis has triggered a tidal wave of disruption with massive economic impact, setting off a chain reaction that hits businesses reliant on international customers, including tourism business operators, importers and exporters, and even community enterprises. Staying adaptable, always looking for new opportunities, and trying new things – these might be the key that enables retailers and community enterprises to handle the disruption brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic sustainably. In Rayong, it appears that local communities and community enterprises are well aware of this fact and are making adjustments to overcome this crisis. To support local communities in their transition to “online retail,” Chemicals Business, SCG, has opened up a virtual marketplace on Facebook named “Rayong Shop Hi,” where local vendors can try their hand at online e-commerce – a new experience for most of them – and sell local goodies in their own style. Chemicals Business, SCG has also given them suggestions on social media posts and delivery services. Because the community members have been quick to adopt the new technology that gives them additional sales channels as well as strictly maintain physical distancing and hygiene, they have successfully turned the situation around to thrive in the new normal era and get through this crisis sustainably. Moving Online Is a Lifeline, Not an Alternative E-commerce has enabled community members to make posts and sell their products online anytime, offering great flexibility for both customers and vendors. Also, because they do not have to maintain a physical store, they can save on rent. These advantages have drawn sellers across Rayong to “Rayong Shop Hi,” a marketplace where they can sell local products under the close guidance of Chemicals Business, SCG team. Lampoei “Gob” Waewsieng, Chairman of Suchada Beach Folk Fishing Community Enterprise in Noen Phra Sub-district, Muang District, Rayong, and Chairman of the Aquaculture Promoters Group, said that his community enterprise, which had also expanded from fisheries to processed seafood products, such as dried and seasoned beltfish, sillago bones, and deep-fried beltfish, is among the many that have adapted in response to the crisis. “When COVID-19 broke out, at first we could not sell to other provinces and had to find ways to overcome this crisis. The SCG team advised us to sell our products on the Facebook Page ‘Rayong Shop Hi.’ It was interesting, so I decided to join the group. SCG taught us how to write social media posts, set prices, deliver products and helped us find other distribution channels. Because we did everything we could, our sales went up by 30,000-35,000 baht per month from our usual 20,000 baht per month. The feedback has been amazing. Also, to extend the shelf life of our products, we have introduced nitrogen flushing to the packaging process. As a result, our products can last 2-3 months.” Delivery Services: Boosting Convenience for Customers Lawan Yungyune, Chairman of Tulip Housewife Group Community Enterprise in Noen Phayom Community, Rayong, said that thanks to SCG’s support and guidance, the group’s Eight Immortals Chinese Pastries successfully earned the Thai FDA’s approval. However, their business was severely affected by the serious COVID-19 outbreak in March. “When the COVID-19 outbreak first began, we could not sell our pastries at all. Our sales went from over a hundred thousand to zero baht. The good thing was that we had orchards, so we started selling fruits instead. However, we could not send them to markets either as they were all closed down during the first phase of the lockdown. Because customers did not come to us, we had to go to them. So, I decided to join ‘Rayong Shop Hi’ to sell our mangosteens, Mon Thong durians, rambutans, lanzones, and santols. The SCG team also recommended to us SCG Express, an express small-parcel delivery service provider that could deliver fruits over long distances.” Keeping the Guard Up: Enforcing Strict Safety and Hygiene Measures Hygiene and physical distancing are first and foremost in any services during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that applies to online selling as well. When hit by the coronavirus outbreak, Thanyaphat “Chompooh” Saengprasert, member of Ban Bon Community in Map Ta Phut, Rayong, originally a mangosteen exporter, was forced to sell her fruits to local people instead. “We all have to adapt. As customers grew more reluctant to leave their houses because of COVID-19,we shifted online and started looking for Facebook pages where we could sell our products. That was when the SCG Team recommended ‘Rayong Shop Hi’ to us. Because we saw posts by local people, we jumped in and started pushing our fruits, too. That opened up an opportunity for us to expand our domestic market to make up for the lost export volume and improved our sales. Also, hygiene is our top priority. Our delivery staff must always wear a mask while on duty and maintain physical distance by asking customers to leave cash in front of their homes and hanging their orders on the front door. This is to assure our customers of the hygiene.” These are only a few examples of how sellers and community enterprises in Rayong are adapting to a new way of selling their products. In this new landscape, the ability to access and learn how to use technology is crucial, and business owners must work to ensure excellent management of their delivery services as well as hygiene and safety. As a result, every day will be a new learning experience until everyone can mutually achieve a new harmony and develop a new sustainable way of life.

335,Industry Ministry's innovation centre fast-tracked,"The Industry Ministry is speeding up its planned investment innovation promotion centre, expecting to support future investment flows under the flagship Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) scheme.

According to Industry Minister Uttama Savanayana, the centre is positioned as the first innovation centre in Southeast Asia in the region's largest special economic zone.

The centre has been renamed from the innovation space that Mr Uttama initiated in the past few months. It will be located in Chon Buri, one of the three host provinces of the corridor.

The centre will provide information and investment details about the EEC.

""We aim to facilitate and support existing and new investors worldwide, and the centre is also following the government's 4.0 initiative,"" Mr Uttama said. ""We have such a high expectation that new technology and innovation will improve the country's industry, investment and economy in the long run.""

He said the ministry is in discussions with many related state agencies about the centre's framework.

Mr Uttama said he expects the framework to be completed soon, but further details such as budget have yet to be disclosed.

In addition, Mr Uttama said the ministry is working on a circular economy roadmap, to be concluded this month.

""We are speeding this circular economy project, and the ministry is in talks with private companies and the UN Industrial Development Organization (Unido) for the roadmap development,"" he said. ""The ministry expects to propose this roadmap to the cabinet for acknowledgement and approval in the same month.""

Unido has a duty to promote industrial development for poverty reduction, inclusive globalisation and environmental sustainability.

Founded in 1966, Unido has 173 member states and is headquartered in Vienna.

Thailand is participating with Unido to develop the circular economy framework in Thailand, as the organisation has many experts on the circular model, which also fits well with the government's smart city policy.

""Unido is in talks with the EEC Office about the development framework, such as transport, logistics, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), waste management, re-treatment and energy,"" Mr Uttama said.

Furthermore, Thailand assumes the Asean chairmanship next year, and as such the government will have an important duty for the country to drive the region forward to achieve the utmost benefits for Thais and peoples across the region.

The government and Unido plan to improve Asean's SME efficiency to the industry 4.0 stage. Thailand will organise the symposium on Asean SME 4.0 for the first time.

Li Yong, Unido's director-general, said the organisation has 65 resource-efficient cleaner production centres worldwide to help support businesses in increasing their efficiency, cost reductions and environmental friendliness.

""We will team up with Thailand for many partnership projects such as innovation, technology and eco-innovation to promote eco-industry in the country,"" Mr Li said.",Thailand,2018.10
382,Ionic liquids offer new solution to plastic recycling - Xinhua | English.news.cn,"BEIJING, Nov. 30 (Xinhua) -- From plastic water bottles along the River Thames in the UK to plastic wrappings after China's ""double 11"" shopping spree, the problem of ""white pollution"" keeps ballooning.

Thanks to a salt in liquid state ""ionic liquids,"" Chinese researchers from Ionic Liquids Clean Process Team (ILC), Institute of Process Engineering (IPE) under Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), have developed a new recycling technology to break polyester (PET) plastics down into their most basic molecules, to perpetually remake the plastic waste as its own raw material.

PET is the fourth-most-produced polymer in the world. It is widely used in daily life, in drinking bottles, carpet fibers, printable circuits, polyester fabrics and the like.

Although reducing usage and improving waste systems can put a dent in the plastics entering the environment, the rate of production is tremendous compared to its degradability.

Most recycled plastics are simply broken into pellets that are then remolded to make new plastic products of lesser quality.

The pollution caused by some traditional recycling methods is high while the efficiency is low, IPE Principal Investigator Lu Xingmei told Xinhua.

Ionic liquids have ions that refuse to stack neatly into crystals like table salt and make them exist as liquid. They stand out in the green chemistry movement because they rarely evaporate, so cannot be inhaled and do not form smog.

""Using ionic liquids as catalysts, we split the long polymer chains of PET plastics into constituent parts, increasing the final degradability to 100 percent in the lab and cutting the use of water in the recycling process by more than 75 percent,"" she said.

The Chinese researchers are discussing with British company Green Lizard Technologies plans to build a 10,000-tonne capacity PET plastic recycling facility in Britain.

Zhang Suojiang, director of ILC and director of IPE, believes commercializing the new technology will promote the promising future of the circular economy.

Dismantling plastics to their chemical parts provides building blocks to remake plastic products of equally high quality. Theoretically, it could lead to an infinite recycle, said Zhang.

It's still cheaper to burn plastic waste and or to throw it in landfills. The Chinese researchers are planning to make their new chemical recycling technology more economical.",China,2018.11

431,"German environmental minister announces ""trend reversal"" to reduce plastic waste - Xinhua | English.news.cn","BERLIN, Nov. 26 (Xinhua) -- Germany's environmental minister Svenja Schulze seeks to reduce plastic waste in Germany while promoting the use of recycling, a plan presented by the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) on Monday shows.

""With these measures, we are initiating a trend reversal in the use of plastics,"" said the environmental minister during the presentation of the governmental plan.

""We produce far too much plastic,"" said Schulze, arguing that this consumption behavior would be exported to emerging and developing countries with serious consequences especially for the marine environment.

The so-called five-point plan seeks, among other things, to ""avoid unnecessary products and packaging"".

The German government is supporting a European-wide ban on disposable plastic articles such as plastic dishware, which is to be adopted this year.

The German government also plans to introduce further financial incentives to promote the use of ecological packaging. According to Schulze, companies that use packaging that is recyclable or made from recycled materials will have to pay less charges.

According to an earlier report by the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA), Germans produced 18.16 million tons of plastic packaging in 2016, averaging 220 kg per capita, which is more than that of any other country in the European Union. Two years ago, numerous retailers in Germany jointly agreed to stop offering plastic bags free of charge which halved the amount of plastic bags used in Germany.

On Jan. 1, 2019, a new packaging law will come into effect in Germany. The law will increase the obligatory recycling rate for plastics from currently 36 percent to 58.8 percent. In 2022, this quota is scheduled to be further raised to 63 percent. In addition, the recycling quotas in Germany for other packaging materials such as paper, glass and metals are to be increased gradually.

The recycling rate of packaging materials varies greatly depending on the materials used.

According to UBA, 70 percent of packaging waste in Germany was recycled last year. With recycling rates around 90 percent, glass, aluminum, paper and steel are much more likely to find their way into the circular economy than plastics which are recycled at a rate of 49.7 percent. With a rate of 25 percent, wood products are the least recycled.

According to the German environmental ministry, the introduction of the new law will put Germany ahead of the EU's ""new ambitious recycling quotas"", which stipulate a recycling rate of 55 percent of household waste from 2025 onwards.",China,2018.11

This announcement follows a five-week public consultation process, where 92 per cent of submitters supported the proposed mandatory phase-out.

""The clear majority of people who responded to the consultation supported a nationwide phase-out of single-use plastic bags, and many called on the Government to act quickly to make this change,"" said Eugenie Sage.

""Government has carefully considered the full range of views put forward, and it's now time to take action as a step towards addressing plastic pollution.

""Single-use plastic bags often end up polluting our precious coastal and marine environments and cause serious harm to marine mammals, sea-birds and other marine life.

""Many retailers and individuals have already stopped using single-use plastic bags and recent research shows 50 per cent of New Zealanders now say they always bring reusable bags when shopping.

""This change will be difficult for some people, and I acknowledge the impact on retailers, as well as local manufacturers and importers of plastic bags. For this reason, and to meet World Trade Organisation requirements, the phase-out will have a six month implementation period, despite calls for a shorter timeframe.

""Plastic waste is polluting our land, lakes and rivers, sea coast and oceans. Single-use plastic is a big part of the problem, with plastic bags among the most common items found in beach clean-ups in New Zealand.

477,Taiwan races to meet Paris goals,"AVERAGE temperatures in Taiwan over the past two years have been the highest in 100 years. Since 2017, rainfall has dropped markedly, affecting Taiwan’s hydroelectricity generation. These recent developments are having a considerable impact and pose a significant threat.

Other parts of the world have witnessed similar trends. During the 2018 summer season, many countries across the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North America, and North Africa have experienced record-breaking heatwaves and deadly wildfires that seriously jeopardise health, agriculture, ecosystems and infrastructure.

To implement the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and achieve its goals, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in addition to faithfully conducting important projects, consultations, and negotiations, has also invited parties from various fields to join the Talanoa Dialogue, so as to take full advantage of the collective wisdom of humankind in formulating workable solutions to climate change.

As a member of the global village, and in line with the Paris Agreement, Taiwan has actively encouraged all stakeholders to do their part and strengthen efforts towards reducing carbon emissions.

Taiwan has passed the Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act, under which five-year carbon reduction targets have been formulated. Taiwan has also created the National Climate Change Action Guidelines and implemented the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Action Plan, which targets six major sectors: energy, manufacturing, transport, residential and commercial development, agriculture, and environmental management. Taiwan seeks to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 to less than 50% of 2005 levels.

Almost 90% of Taiwan’s annual greenhouse gas emissions come from fuel combustion. The government is striving to increase the share of renewable sources in overall energy generation to 20% by 2025, and raise the share of energy produced with natural gas up to 50%. Earlier in 2018, Taiwan’s Air Pollution Control Act was amended, with stronger measures to curtail air pollution and accelerate Taiwan’s energy transition.

Taiwan’s energy policies are being promoted in consideration of four core aspects: energy security, green economy, environmental sustainability, and social fairness.

Furthermore, Taiwan is working on an energy transformation white paper and encouraging public participation and input during this process. It is also implementing key action plans under the Energy Development Guidelines, so as to make a decisive shift towards sustainable energy development.

According to research by the Global Footprint Network, human consumption of natural resources is outpacing the ability of the planet’s ecosystems to regenerate resources by a factor of 1.7. In fact, in 2018, Earth Overshoot Day fell on Aug 1, which was earlier than ever before.

To find a proper balance between economic development and environmental protection, Taiwan is promoting the circular economy as part of the Five Plus Two Innovative Industries programme. There is a widespread international consensus that the circular economy plays a vital role in achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement.

Taiwan has already made significant progress over the past two decades in recycling and reusing resources. In fact, in 2017, Taiwan’s resource recovery rate was 52.5%, a ratio surpassed only by Germany and Austria.

The recycling rate of plastic bottles in Taiwan in 2017 was 95%. And during the 2018 FIFA World Cup, about half of the 32 teams in the tournament wore jerseys produced with recycled bottles from Taiwan.

Taiwan is more than willing to share its technology and experience with the international community.

Having benefited tremendously from industrialisation, Taiwan is now fully committed to playing a key role in saving the planet and its precious ecosystems.

Taiwan is ready and willing to share its knowledge and experience in environmental management, disaster prevention and warning systems, energy efficiency enhancement technology, and application of innovative technology.

Climate change is a matter of our planet’s survival, and should not be reduced to a political issue. Taiwan has long been unfairly disregarded by and isolated from the United Nations system. This has not discouraged us.

In a professional, pragmatic, and constructive manner, Taiwan will seek meaningful participation in international organisations and events, and fulfil its responsibilities as a member of the international community. Let Taiwan join the world, and let the world embrace Taiwan.",Malaysia,2018.11
513,New Zealand joins declaration on biodiversity - Xinhua | English.news.cn,"WELLINGTON, Nov. 17 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand is joining its voice and influence with others in the international community to better protect biodiversity by joining the Sharm El-Sheikh Declaration.

Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage joined other political leaders at the event to discuss global biodiversity at the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) High Level Segment in Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt on Thursday.

""This declaration comes at a pivotal point for nature,"" Sage said, adding despite significant efforts, global biodiversity continues to decline.

New Zealand has started to develop a new national biodiversity strategy, she said.

""With many of New Zealand's native plants and wildlife found nowhere else in the world, we have an international responsibility to safeguard them for their own sake, and for present and future generations,"" the minister said.

The declaration focuses on the importance of mainstreaming biodiversity across relevant sectors of the economy, with a particular emphasis on energy and mining, infrastructure, and manufacturing and processing, as well as health.

""It was important to New Zealand that the declaration acknowledges the importance of circular economy principles to ensure less waste is created and more reuse is possible,"" said Sage.

The meeting of the parties to the Convention, which continues over the next two weeks, will establish a pathway towards the adoption in 2020 of a new global biodiversity plan.",China,2018.11
535,"‘Circular economy’ can be achieved, says Jeffrey Cheah","KUALA LUMPUR: The circular economy in Asia, which is the best chance in reversing the causes of climate change and achieving environment-focused goals, is achievable with the right innovation and invention, said Sunway University chancellor and Sunway Group founder and chairman Tan Sri Jeffrey Cheah.

The circular economy is a regenerative system where resource input, waste, and leakage are minimised through maximising usage, as well as recovering and regenerating products and materials at the end of each service life.

“We are living in an age where technology is transforming the world.

“We can already see the effects of technology on the global economy, geopolitics and society.

“I believe that it is now more important than ever not just to raise awareness about sustainability but to also implement policies that promote the sustainable development agenda,” he said at Sustainability Summit Asia 2018 yesterday.

The full-day summit themed ‘Going Full Circle’ opened with a dialogue on policy framework for sustainable development goals adoption in Asia before outlining the need to drive mainstream conversation among policymakers, businesses, as well as citizens to embrace long-term initiatives that will lead to positive effect in economic goals while leaving a better planet for future generations.

During the summit, delegates addressed the need for public, private partnership to align interests and significantly step up its development efforts across sectors to find multilateral solutions to overcome transboundary challenges.

Meanwhile, Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change Minister Yeo Bee Yin, in her closing keynote, highlighted the importance of replacing, alongside the 3Rs of reuse, reduce, and recycle.

“We need to replace plastic packaging with biodegradable and compostable alternatives.

“We want to control plastic waste but what we lack right now is education.

“Hence, as part of the government’s zero-single use plastic roadmap by 2030, our ministry (Mestecc) is focusing on a thought provoking media campaign to change the mindsets of the people (on the need to control plastic waste),” she said.

542,Waste management and circular economy,"Metals are of the 24x7 indispensable requirements in human life. In absence of metals, the country cannot think about its infrastructural growth and self-reliance on the economic front as well. This is also true for us and responsible for the slow infrastructural growth of Pakistan. Unfortunately, in the last 70 years of timeframe, the country’s demands for metals could not be fulfilled at the rate it was required to do. On contrary to this, the scenario for metals production and demand is totally different in the neighbouring countries and it directly reflects on their growth story. It is a fact that although we have several mineral deposits, either they are unaccounted and/or, yet to be exploited. Therefore, this is a time to take the wake-up call. The entire world, including those, have the ample primary reserves of valuable and critical metals, is moving for the circular economy. Having no barrier for the primary reserves of minerals by the recycling of secondary and/or, end-of-life or say, waste materials at the end of the non-producing country is one of the prime advantages of the circular economy. By moving towards it, Pakistan can really do well to mitigate the supply-risk of essential metals in the infrastructure development of the country.

Not only the economic but also at the societal-front, the move can help a lot to us. The generation of industrial, electrical and electronic waste and household waste containing the metal body, wires, handles, goods etc. other than the municipal waste in huge volume is globally recognised problem. Even after the Basel convention, the trans-boundary movement from developed countries to Pakistan did not stop. Pakistan has become the favourite destination for their waste dumping. Which is not a good sign in a long-term, if not properly handled. The situation in Karachi and nearby dumping and dismantling areas for such wastes are the prominent examples, where the public health condition has been severely affected and the condition of soil and water is also going to be adverse. It is a matter of grave concern in the country where approximately 5 million annual deaths are alone due to the waste-related diseases.

For a country struggling on the economic front to be self-reliance and up-gradation of infrastructure facilities to provide the people a better life, it is the high time to take a call on changing its waste to the wealth. The global transition from waste disposal to the circular economy guided waste management can also be experienced in Pakistan. Even the leaders like the European Union, Japan, and the United States are serious about their limited resources and step-by-step introducing the ethos of the circular economy. For an example of metal recycling, approximately 8.2 Mt of aluminium and its alloy were produced in the year 2000 as the recycled product that was accounted for 33% of the total primary production of aluminium. It was 93% in the US, 59% in France, and 89% in Germany, while 186-folds higher in Japan than the primary production of aluminium. If calculated in terms of energy saving, each ton of primary aluminium consumes 213 x 106 kJ (17 x 103 kWh electricity) energy, which is only 5.48 x 106 kJ if recovered by recycling. The huge saving in energy successfully cut down the production cost of aluminium. It also reduces the water consumption by 10.5 t for each ton of aluminium production and controls the 92% emission of CO2 to the environment. In totality, the circular economy will be profitable if we combined it with the relatively cheap labour cost in the country. This change in the scenario can be of greater extent when the circular economy for the other base metals essentially used in infrastructure development like iron, steel, copper, and zinc will be included in practice to boost the main economy of the country.

Henceforth, the efficient measures associated with circular economics for metal recycling from the waste materials are needed to be taken. It includes, certainly not limited to, the taxation for waste generation, penalty for landfill disposal of metal-bearing waste, extended producer responsibility including the payback projects for treating the hazardous metals, levy on primary raw materials, taxation on specific products like those generating the hazardous metal-bearing waste during manufacturing process, and subsidy for formal recycling of metals etc. Nevertheless, the most distinctive transition needs to be changed is that waste or, end-of-life metals are not regarded to be as a ‘‘waste’’ any more but taken as a potential “resource” in the country.

563,ELECTIONS: Kaohsiung hopefuls focus on economy in TV presentation - Taipei Times,"KMT mayoral candidate Han Kuo-yu said he would make the city a ‘youthful’ and ‘rich town,’ while DPP hopeful Chen Chi-mai cited his term as acting mayor

Economic issues dominated a live TV “platform presentation” by the two main candidates in the Kaohsiung mayoral race yesterday.

Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Chen Chi-mai (陳其邁) said that Kaohsiung, the largest city in southern Taiwan, should try to strengthen its economy.

Developing tourism is one way to do so, he said.

Chen said he would improve Kaohsiung’s economy by developing the city as an Asian transportation hub, given its advantageous geographic location.

He said he would develop the high-tech industry in the city by building a semiconductor cluster and a technology corridor, while also encouraging an upgrade of the old economy sector so that it would become more competitive.

Chen also said he would also focus on green energy and a circular economy.

Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) candidate Han Kuo-yu (韓國瑜) said that Kaohsiung, once a jewel in Taiwan’s crown, is a sleeping giant whose economy has slowed down over the past two decades.

The time has come for the giant to awaken, Han said.

Kaohsiung has an advantage in aviation and sea transportation, as well as promising fishing and agricultural industries, Han said, adding that it should build on those strengths.

However, many people in Kaohsiung have lost hope due to long-term economic stagnation, while the city’s population is shrinking, he said.

The city needs a new mayor to lead its economic revival, so the giant can rise up again, Han said.

Kaohsiung also needs a new leader to solve the problems that have caused the economic slowdown and to make it more attractive to investors, he said, adding that the biggest challenge for the next mayor would be to make Kaohsiung great again.

“I will lead Kaohsiung into the future as a youthful town, a rich town,” Han said. “People coming to Kaohsiung will say it is a huge city, fun to visit and even easier to make money in.”

In response to Shu Te University dean Chen Ching-yao (陳清燿), who asked how he intends to implement his platform, Chen Chi-mai cited his three-month term as acting mayor of then-Kaohsiung City in 2005 as evidence of his efficiency.

During his term, Chen said he demonstrated his ability to stand firm, to execute policies and to negotiate when he facilitated the city government’s retention of piers by staging talks between Taiwan International Ports Corp’s Kaohsiung branch, the Taiwan Railways Administration and the Ministry of National Defense.

However, Han said it was more important to cultivate trust among people.

If a majority of residents is angry and distrustful of the government, no policy, regardless how good or well-intentioned, could be pushed through, Han said.

The presentation also included independent candidates Chu Mei-feng (璩美鳳) and Su Ying-kuei (蘇盈貴), who lag far behind Chen and Han in opinion polls.",Taiwan,2018.11
570,GSBS ends in Germany with call for spreading happiness thr...,"Wolfsburg (Germany), Nov 9 (UNB) - The 9th Global Social Business Summit (GSBS) ended here on Friday seeking genuine efforts to address key global challenges and build a future that will spread happiness around the world through desired transformation.

Experts from the private sector, civil society, governments and academia - around 800 participants from 55 countries - shared their ideas on how together a new civilization can be built giving everybody a better life and better future.

They focused on plastic and circular economy, mobility, solidarity, sports and social business and food and its value during the two-day Summit with a hope to see big smiles around.

The prominent speakers explored ideas of how mobility and social business can create a better future for disadvantaged groups and improve people's life in a sustainable way of transportation.

Circular economy got special focus at the Summit as the concept recognises the importance of the economy needing to work effectively at all scales - for large and small businesses, for organisations and individuals, globally and locally.

The speakers stressed that transitioning to a circular economy represents a systemic shift that builds long-term resilience, generates business and economic opportunities, and provides environmental and societal benefits.

Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Prof Muhammad Yunus and his creative adviser Hans Reitz organised the annual event and the leading conference on social business with the support of Volkswagen and Autostadt.

During a session on Friday, Prof Yunus said it will be a circular economy instead of wasteful economy as they were discussing on building a new civilization.

Expressing the hope over finding solution to any crisis, he said, ""Every crisis has an opportunity.""

Prof Yunus laid emphasis on taking best advantage of opportunity that every crisis brings.

He advised Volkswagen Group to convert itself into a social business or at least 'B Corp' to have better image forgetting the past. ""Forget about the past.""

The German car giant came under criticism when it admitted cheating emission tests in the United States three years back.

Certified ""B Corporations"" are a kind of business balancing purpose and profit. They are legally required to consider the impact of their day-to-day policies and practices on their workers, customers, suppliers, community and the environment.

The European ""B Corp"" movement, officially launched in 2015 with 60 companies, has now grown to 500+ B Corps and is leading the way in Europe.

Adviser to Prof Yunus Nurjahan Begum said women and children are suffering in this world though they do not deserve this miserable life. ""To me, a new civilization means a world where nobody will suffer but will lead a happy life.""

She said she wants to see a world which is free from poverty. ""And of course, a world without any boundary.""

Hans Reitz said plastic does not belong to the nature and they need a fundamental system change to address the problem. “What we need is a circular economy.”

The speakers in two days also shared dreams about the future of mobility, saying all are coming closer to a new era of mobility which will create an ecosystem of connected ways of transportation – for persons and for goods.

They hoped that the future of mobility will be more sustainable, will create less traffic in large cities and will be less ownership-orientated by individuals.

Parliamentary State Secretary to the Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development Dr Maria Flachsbarth of Germany, Executive Director of Yunus Centre Lamiya Morshed, Member of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG, Human Resources and Organization Gunnar Kilian, former NASA Astronaut Ron Garan, CEO Autostadt Roland Clement, CEO of Grameen Creative Lab, Head of GSBS Hans Reitz, Co-Founder and Co-Executive Director of Sing for Hope Monica Yunus, Co-Founder and Co-Executive Director of Sing for Hope Camille Zamora, President and Founder of Jean Bernou Consulting Jean Bernou, Peter Schwarzen­bauer, Impact Investor and Social Entrepreneur Ruben Vardanyan and Board of Management Volkswagen AG, Integrity and Legal Affairs Hiltrud Werner among others, spoke at various sessions of the GSBS 2018.

Prior to the main Summit, the Social Business Academia Conference (SBAC) was held on Tuesday and Wednesday at the Autostadt, the headquarters of Volkswagen.

Prof Yunus, while opening the Social Business Academia Conference on Tuesday, said the academics are the navigators. ""They’re the pilots who’re navigating everyone in the direction we should go as a global society. If we continue on the current path, we’ll head towards disaster with wealth concentration and environmental degradation,"" he said.

He said academics have to find a way to get to a new destination which is sustainable for all of them and social business is one way to do that.

The Social Business Academia Conference was jointly organised by Yunus Centre and the Grameen Creative Lab with the help of the Scientific and Organising Committee of SBAC.

SBAC is a platform for networking of the growing network of Yunus Social Business Centres at universities around the world to share their experiences and future plans.

There are currently 64 YSBCs in 28 countries.

At the SBAC, 37 papers were selected from among 52 submitted papers.

Nineteen of them were presented at the SBAC covering issues like SDGs, health, education and training, technology, marketing, financing social business, wealth concentration and other issues.",Bangladesh,2018.11

The facility is planned for Rayong Industrial Estate in Map Ta Phut.

President and chief executive Supattanapong Punmeechaow said it will be the largest capacity for single-use plastic in Thailand.

""This move is part of PTTGC's long-term strategy that aims to terminate the production of single-use plastic resin at its petrochemical complex within the next five years,"" he said. ""PTTGC produces 150,000 tonnes of single-use plastic resin per year, mostly for bottles, straws and bags.""

Mr Supattanapong said the project is part of PTTGC's circular economy plan, which aims to cut plastic waste in Thailand.

The project is conducting an investment study for a plastic recycling plant that meets international standards.

Details such as appropriate technology, potential business partners, waste management, collection and the business model will be disclosed in early 2019.

""Thailand has lots of single-use plastic waste in both landfills and offshore areas without any management, so we want to deal with this problem,"" Mr Supattanapong said.

The resin to be reproduced will feed into high-graded plastic moulding such as building materials, home decor, textiles, garments and auto parts.

PTTGC aims to reduce single-use plastic to zero in the next five years and focus on bioplastics to reproduce packaging products.

""PTTGC will move into eco-friendlier businesses such as bioplastics production at the biochemical complex in Nakhon Sawan province,"" Mr Supattanapong said.

627,First circular building in Taiwan unveiled at...,"The Holland Pavilion is opened at the Taichung World Flora Exposition on Nov. 3 (Source: NTIO) The Holland Pavilion is opened at the Taichung World Flora Exposition on Nov. 3 (Source: NTIO)

TAICHUNG (Taiwan News) — The Holland Pavilion, the first circular building in Taiwan and a tangible symbol of Taiwan-Netherlands cooperation, was officially unveiled at the Taichung World Flora Exposition Saturday.

“The Holland Pavilion is a perfect testament to successful substantive exchanges between Taiwan and the Netherlands,” said Vice President Chen Chien-jen (陳建仁) at the opening ceremony.

“Through this international event, Taiwan and the Netherlands will pursue deeper cooperation in the circular economy and develop even stronger bilateral relations,” added the vice president.

The pavilion serves as tangible proof of the close partnership between the Dutch and Taiwanese governments, private enterprises as well as academic institutions. 46 organizations and individuals joined in the project to build the two-floor pavilion in which all equipment is rented instead of purchased and the materials used for the construction have been guaranteed that they can be recycled and reused in the future.

For example, the structure of the building is wood provided by Taiwan Sugar Corporation (TSC). After the end of the flora exposition in April next year, the pavilion will be dismantled and the wood and other materials will be redesigned and reused to build a new construction at TSC’s Yumei Tourism Sugar Factory in the Houli District of Taichung.

Taichung Mayor Lin Chia-lung (林佳龍) described the pavilion as a “cornerstone” for cooperation between Taiwan and the Netherlands.

Recounting his first visit to Mayor Franc Weerwind of Almere City in the Netherlands in 2016, Lin said the trip opened a window for the two cities to work together in such fields as the hosting of flora expositions and promoting circular economy.

Lin also signed a letter of intent with Weerwind, with the presence of Vice President Chen and Guy Wittich, head of the Netherlands Trade and Investment Office in Taipei (NTIO), as a commitment that Taichung City will take part in the Floriade, a once-in-ten-years international horticultural exposition which will be hosted by Almere City in 2022.

“Our expos will not be a one-time exhibition, but with our Flora Expos, we will leave sustainability, green, and culture in our cities,” said Lin.

Weerwind, who came to Taichung for the second time with an even bigger economic delegation than the previous visit in the hope of seeking more partners in Taichung, said he anticipates the trip to Taichung should provide inspiration and ideas that can be used for his city and the Netherlands.

“Many circular construction projects have started both in Taichung and in the Netherlands,” said Wittich, pointing to the field as having great economic potentials as 40% of all global urban waste is derived from construction.

“But it will take all stakeholders to cooperate to make it work, and many more exchanges and partnerships in our business models and technologies,” added Wittich.

Apart from the letter of the intent, both the mayor of Taichung and Almere, joined by other participants, also signed a joint declaration, “Circular Now!”, showing their commitment to partnering to promote the circular economy.

628,Groups sign commitment at flora expo - Taipei Times,"The declaration was inked at the Holland Pavilion, which the vice president said is proof of successful exchanges between Taiwan and the Netherlands

Forty-four industrial, academic and government organizations from Taiwan and the Netherlands yesterday signed a joint declaration to demonstrate their commitment to building a circular economy, as they welcomed visitors to Taiwan’s first circular-economy construction at the Houli Forest Expo Site of the Taichung World Flora Exposition, which opened yesterday.

The declaration, titled “Circular, Now!” was inked at the Holland Pavilion, which is 10.3m tall and is the only non-permanent two-story building in the World Garden Competition area. The area contains the works of 31 nations from Europe, the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania.

Built with the goal of leaving zero waste, the Holland Pavilion was built by bolting steel structures together. Nails were replaced with dowels and the pavilion is equipped with energy-conserving pneumatic vacuum elevators.

Its wooden floors, doors and furniture came from old sugar warehouses built by Taiwan Sugar Corp (Taisugar) in Kaohsiung in 1949.

The Netherlands Trade and Investment Office in Taipei said that after the expo ends in April next year, the pavilion will be the first circular building in the world to be dismantled and reconstructed again, at Taisugar’s Yuemei Tourism Sugar Factory.

“The circular economy is all about cooperation and pioneering new circular business models and technologies, and that is exactly what you have demonstrated here,” Dutch Representative to Taiwan Guy Wittich said.

Wittich said 40 percent of global urban waste comes from demolished buildings, which is why he hopes more stakeholders in Taiwan and the Netherlands can cooperate and engage in exchanges and partnerships on circular construction projects.

Lauding the Holland Pavilion as a perfect testament to successful substantive exchanges between Taiwan and the Netherlands, Vice President Chen Chien-jen (陳建仁) said the circular economy and green energy are among the major focuses of the government’s industrial innovation program.

At the ceremony, Taichung Mayor Lin Chia-lung (林佳龍) also inked a letter of intent with Almere Mayor Franc Weerwind to participate in Floriade Expo 2022, which is to be held in Almere, the Netherlands.

Another highlight of the world garden area is an installation by Germany, titled “Floral Frame of Time,” which features a walkable cube made of 233 bamboo sticks.

It is based on the famous “Red Cube” by Farkas Molnar, a Hungarian architect and proponent of Bauhaus, a renowned German art school established in 1919.

Although Molnar did not translate his design into an actual building at the time, the hope is that his ideas will to come to life almost 100 years after they were designed via the installation, which is adorned with paintings by German artists and 600 fragrant Taiwanese herbs, the installation’s lead artist Stephan Murer said.

Two pre-recorded poems composed by Taiwanese poet Lee Chang-ching (李長青), as well as one by German writer and poet Karsten Steinmetz, are played inside the cube twice an hour.

Across from the German installation is a project called “Branches” by Spanish architect Miquel Batlle, who used large branches from about 50 dead trees found near construction sites to create a cone-shaped wooden vault.

Asked why he chose dead trees instead of living ones for his creation, Batlle said the trees he used were mostly chopped down to make way for construction projects and he wanted to send a message to the public that trees and buildings can coexist peacefully.

Another popular installation in the area is a project by Kazakhstan’s Silk Road Horticulture Association, which built a “Central Asian Garden” consisting of elements from both Eastern and Western civilizations to demonstrate Central Asia’s role as a gateway between Europe and Asia.

The project’s use of gold Roman columns and display of blue-painted statues of mythological figures add an exotic sense of mystery to the garden.

According to the Taichung City Government’s Education Bureau, participants’ works were evaluated once before the expo’s opening and will be judged again during the six-month exhibition period.

The winners are to receive their awards at the expo’s closing ceremony in April, the bureau said.",Taiwan,2018.11
677,"Interview: China, EU's interests have been closely intertwined: ambassador - Xinhua | English.news.cn","BRUSSELS, Dec. 29 (Xinhua) -- Despite some ""growing pains"", the relations between China and the European Union (EU) have made important progress in 2018, and the interests of the two sides have been closely intertwined, Ambassador Zhang Ming, head of the Chinese Mission to the EU, told Xinhua in a recent exclusive interview.

In the year of 2018, which marks the 15th anniversary of the establishment of the China-EU Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, the relations between the two sides have maintained a steady growth momentum, with scope of cooperation being expanded and interests further integrated, among others, Zhang said.

In the past year, the 20th China-EU leaders' meeting was successfully held. Leaders of many European countries, including Britain, France and Germany, together with about 10 commissioners of the European Commission and more than 50 members of the European Parliament have visited China.

""Such frequent high-level exchanges have enhanced mutual trust and injected new political impetus into the development of China-EU relations,"" Zhang noted.

In the economic and trade sector, bilateral trade volume has grown rapidly to a new height this year. The two sides also exchanged offers of bilateral investment treaty, agreed to end the negotiation of the Agreement on Geographical Indications in a timely manner, and signed new cooperation agreements on circular economy, blue partnership and customs cooperation.

China-EU relations are bearing more significance on the global level, Zhang added. ""China and the EU have more common words in supporting multilateralism and improving global governance; They also issued a joint statement on climate change while maintaining close communication on such global and regional hot issues as the Iranian nuclear and Syria.""

In addition, China and the EU have deepened their cooperation on the Belt and Road initiative, Zhang said. With a growing positive voice within the Union, the EU's recognition and understanding of the initiative are more objective thanks to their deepened political consensus and more fruitful cooperation.

During the 20th China-EU leaders' meeting and the 12th Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) summit, China and the EU reached important consensus on synergizing connectivity between the Belt and Road initiative and the EU Strategy on Connecting Europe and Asia. Many Chinese and European companies have cooperated in third-party markets including Asia and Africa to carry out major projects in infrastructure, energy, environmental protection and finance.

The pragmatic results of China and the EU in 2018 are inseparable from the positive attitude of the EU in developing cooperation with China. The EU's objective voice toward China is rising. And with a greater expectation, the EU is more active in making strategic plan for the development of bilateral relations, Zhang noted.

""China appreciates the EU's positive stance on developing bilateral relations and is willing to meet the EU halfway, hoping that the Union could match its words to deeds, respect China's core interests and major concerns, and develop bilateral relations in a fair, equitable, open and win-win manner,"" Zhang said.

Meanwhile, the year 2019 is important to both sides as it marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the European Parliament election.

""Amid rising protectionism and unilateralism on the global arena, China and the EU have a greater responsibility to promote bilateral relations, enhance mutually beneficial cooperation for the good of the two peoples while continuously adhering to multilateralism, so as to deal with the uncertainty of the global situation with stable bilateral relations,"" said the ambassador.

""The interests of China and the EU have been closely intertwined, but the potential for cooperation needs to be further explored,"" Zhang said.

For now, EU's investment in China accounts for 4 percent of its total external investment stock, while China's investment to the EU only takes up 2 percent of the latter's foreign investment, according to the ambassador.

""There is still pretty much room left to expand bilateral cooperation,"" he said.

Talking about the differences between China and the EU on some specific issues, Zhang said that given their different history, culture, national conditions and developing levels, it is normal to have different views.

China and the EU have a solid foundation of political mutual trust, long-standing economic complementarities. As long as the two sides uphold the spirit of mutual respect, working together for mutually beneficial results, the ""growing pains"" will eventually be solved, Zhang said.",China,2018.12
681,"China, EU's interests have been closely intertwined: ambassador - Global Times","Despite some ""growing pains"", the relations between China and the European Union (EU) have made important progress in 2018, and the interests of the two sides have been closely intertwined, Ambassador Zhang Ming, head of the Chinese Mission to the EU, told Xinhua in a recent exclusive interview.In the year of 2018, which marks the 15th anniversary of the establishment of the China-EU Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, the relations between the two sides have maintained a steady growth momentum, with scope of cooperation being expanded and interests further integrated, among others, Zhang said.In the past year, the 20th China-EU leaders' meeting was successfully held. Leaders of many European countries, including Britain, France and Germany, together with about 10 commissioners of the European Commission and more than 50 members of the European Parliament have visited China.""Such frequent high-level exchanges have enhanced mutual trust and injected new political impetus into the development of China-EU relations ,"" Zhang noted.In the economic and trade sector, bilateral trade volume has grown rapidly to a new height this year. The two sides also exchanged offers of bilateral investment treaty, agreed to end the negotiation of the Agreement on Geographical Indications in a timely manner, and signed new cooperation agreements on circular economy, blue partnership and customs cooperation.China-EU relations are bearing more significance on the global level, Zhang added. ""China and the EU have more common words in supporting multilateralism and improving global governance; They also issued a joint statement on climate change while maintaining close communication on such global and regional hot issues as the Iranian nuclear and Syria.""In addition, China and the EU have deepened their cooperation on the Belt and Road initiative, Zhang said. With a growing positive voice within the Union, the EU's recognition and understanding of the initiative are more objective thanks to their deepened political consensus and more fruitful cooperation.During the 20th China-EU leaders' meeting and the 12th Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) summit, China and the EU reached important consensus on synergizing connectivity between the Belt and Road initiative and the EU Strategy on Connecting Europe and Asia. Many Chinese and European companies have cooperated in third-party markets including Asia and Africa to carry out major projects in infrastructure, energy, environmental protection and finance.The pragmatic results of China and the EU in 2018 are inseparable from the positive attitude of the EU in developing cooperation with China. The EU's objective voice toward China is rising. And with a greater expectation, the EU is more active in making strategic plan for the development of bilateral relations, Zhang noted.""China appreciates the EU's positive stance on developing bilateral relations and is willing to meet the EU halfway, hoping that the Union could match its words to deeds, respect China's core interests and major concerns, and develop bilateral relations in a fair, equitable, open and win-win manner,"" Zhang said.Meanwhile, the year 2019 is important to both sides as it marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the European Parliament election.""Amid rising protectionism and unilateralism on the global arena, China and the EU have a greater responsibility to promote bilateral relations, enhance mutually beneficial cooperation for the good of the two peoples while continuously adhering to multilateralism, so as to deal with the uncertainty of the global situation with stable bilateral relations,"" said the ambassador.""The interests of China and the EU have been closely intertwined, but the potential for cooperation needs to be further explored,"" Zhang said.For now, EU's investment in China accounts for 4 percent of its total external investment stock, while China's investment to the EU only takes up 2 percent of the latter's foreign investment, according to the ambassador.""There is still pretty much room left to expand bilateral cooperation,"" he said.Talking about the differences between China and the EU on some specific issues, Zhang said that given their different history, culture, national conditions and developing levels, it is normal to have different views.China and the EU have a solid foundation of political mutual trust, long-standing economic complementarities.

695,"News Analysis: ""Green"" priorities go local in Italy with plans to transform ex-power plants - China.org.cn","You are here:

ROME, Dec. 27 (Xinhua) -- Italy's slow-moving transition away from traditional fuel resources is speeding up on a local level as the process begins to convert a handful of power stations into low environmental-impact facilities with innovative new uses.

The country's former state energy monopoly, Enel, is spearheading the project, which is starting out on two out-of-use plants -- Portoscuso, a former oil-fired plant on the island of Sardinia, and Campomarino, a gas turbine plant in the southern region of Molise.

Enel has identified two-dozen total projects across the country that are in some stage of transition. One is a former mining project and the other 23 ex-power plants.

In a statement, Enel called the larger transformation initiative -- dubbed the ""Futur-e"" strategy -- the company's ""most important and ambitious circular economy project.""

The phrase ""circular economy"" is shorthand for a system that minimizes waste by making systems more efficient, reusing as much as possible, and recycling byproducts.

The idea is not new: The Tate Modern museum in London, the Caixa Forum Cultural Center in Madrid, and Lisbon's Tejo Electricity Museum are all housed in what were once urban power stations.

But what is unusual about the projects in Italy, according to Edoardo Zanchini, national vice-president for the largest Italian environmental lobby group Legambiente, is that most of the 23 plants Enel is seeking for transition are comparatively isolated or in under-developed areas -- in contrast to the projects in Britain, Spain, and Portugal, which are located on valuable real-estate in each country's capital.

""It's an ambitious initiative,"" Zanchini told Xinhua. ""Of the 24 separate projects, some are organized better than others. But together they will result in a major environmental step forward for Italy.""

Portoscuso and Campomarino are the furthest along of the 24 projects, with companies or other entities vying to head the transformation plans required to submit a formal submission of interest early in 2019. Ten more are plants that are approaching a similar phase of development.

Each proposal will be evaluated by specially appointed commissions made up of local stakeholders, academics, analysts and representatives from Enel. Tenders will be judged based on specific needs of the surrounding community, the innovativeness of the proposal, adherence to the guidelines of the ""circular economy"" as well as the long term social, economic and environmental sustainability of the ideas.

Enel officials said the former power plants could be transformed into a wide array of other uses, including low environmental-impact smart villages, recreation sites, shopping areas and Internet technology centers.

Francesco Ferrante, a former senator and co-founder of Green Italia, an advocacy group, told Xinhua the usefulness of the projects goes beyond the specific benefits of individual projects.

""There are obvious environmental benefits of making better use of each plant,"" Ferrante said. ""But there is also very important symbolic value, showing that Italy and a major utility like Enel are taking environmental priorities seriously."" Enditem",China,2018.12

PVH, the company that owns Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein and Speedo, signed not one but three major initiatives this year in a bid to reduce the waste generated by its fashion brands and the industry in general.

The group joined the Global Fashion Agenda (GFA), a non-profit initiative that aims to boost sustainability levels within the fashion business, teamed up with Fashion For Good (FFG), an organisation that supports startups in becoming more sustainable, and became a core partner and member of the Advisory Board of The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which works with businesses, government and academia to accelerate and promote a transition to a circular economy.

Denim brand Guess has had a troubled year, but its focus on sustainability remained strong, with the launch of a circular fashion recycling program dubbed ‘Resourced’.

The concept offers US shoppers in-store discounts when they donate used clothing, in an effort to give secondhand pieces new life, and reduce textile waste. The company plans to roll it out globally by 2020.

Gap Inc – which counts Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic on its books – pledged this year to save 10 billion liters of water by the end of 2020.

The fashion conglomerate aims to economise on water resources by focusing on product innovation and improving efficiency at its fabric mills and laundries, and hopes that the initiative will help affected communities achieve better access to clean water and sanitation.

This month, the luxury fashion and lifestyle conglomerate Kering announced the launch of the ‘Sustainable Innovation Award’ – a new fashion prize in China.

Launched in partnership with the innovation platform Plug and Play, the award will single out innovative startups and technologies in Greater China that are offering a positive environmental and social impact by focusing on raw materials, green supply chain concepts and the circular economy, in an attempt to encourage sustainably-minded fashion processes.

Three winners will receive mentorship and networking opportunities to develop their concepts.

Or for that matter, a cheela made of drumstick leaves by another group might give you nutrition, taste and aesthetic pleasure. So many farmers and entrepreneurs have brought different traditional and new dishes. Painting dry cotton balls in different colours is a children idea from dendhuki. You can visit Sattvik tomorrow and also on 25th to partake satvik food, ingredients, crafts are on display by 50 women groups supported by Ministry of Women and Child Development from Jammu and Krishna, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Uttarakhand, Bihar and so any more places.

Children are enjoying the innovation maze designed by GIAN team. Children have to find their way out and when they get lost, they find a new innovation. Should not we all get lost some time if that helps us discover innovations. There is a photo shoot site nearby on a designer cycle rickshaw and also a children creativity spot near GIAN maze. Come and get lost.

It in addition to this, we have tried to add more meaningful cultural activities this time including a poetry session chaired by Shri Raghuveer Chaudhary, a distinguished Jianpeeth awardee. Sessions by eminent doctors on preventive health including by ayurvedic experts, physiotherapist, orthopaedic experts, diabetic specialists etc., are also there.

There were several policy advocacy sessions on behalf of organic farmers and start-ups. Some of the suggestions we made are: a) there should be open access space in every city for farmers to sell their organic produce directly to consumers; b) just as start-ups, generally from urban areas, have been given five years of relief from a lot of procedural requirements, organic farmers should also be allowed for at least ten years to sell their products without too many restrictions and requirements; c) farmers income cannot be increased without reducing costs. One way is to reduce the cost of inputs by using herbal pesticides and growth promoters. SRISTI has perhaps the only lab dedicated to develop such products and test their efficacy. We need many more such well-equipped labs in the country to promote sustainable agriculture; d) dissemination of sustainable practices through kisan call centre must become obligatory. AT this stage they just promote chemical including some which are banned in many other countries; e) the start-ups should share their failures and set back to help budding entrepreneurs in charting their future path; f) not many states have included the stories of innovators from and for grassroots in the textbooks and curriculum; how will a culture of innovation evolve in the true terms, g) the support from regulatory agencies need a lot of strengthening. The motorcycle based and now chahsis based santi, multipurpose agri machine sis still not eligible for to approval and thus is illegal in the strict sense of the terms Every year Gujarat itself has a sale of about ten thousand santis, all illegal but all legitimate. On one had government has a policy of promoting circular economy but on the other, it will not approve solutions using second-hand parts.

I hope we will hear from many of you in coming two days more suggestions to make the eco-system for promoting women based enterprises, organic agriculture, farmer-consumer interface and promotion of innovations for and from grassroots. We will pursue many more ideas at the fourth International conference by the Honey Bee Network on Creativity and Innovation at IIMA January 28-30, 2019.

753,Taipei-Shanghai forum opens today in Taipei - Taipei Times,"Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je and Mainland Affairs Council Minister Chen Ming-tong each said discussing economics would help avoid disputes

The twin-city forum between Taipei and Shanghai opens today in Taipei, focusing on economic issues with the circular economy as its theme, Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je (柯文哲) said yesterday.

Held annually by the cities since 2010, the two-day forum has sparked controversy because of China’s suppression of Taiwan in the international community, but Ko said that as long as economics, rather than politics, remained the center of discussion, there were unlikely to be any disputes.

Ko was responding to comments by Mainland Affairs Council Minister Chen Ming-tong (陳明通), who had earlier yesterday said he hoped the forum would not stir up any political turmoil.

Chen said inter-city exchanges across the Taiwan Strait were in line with the council’s policies and he looked forward to seeing the forum proceed smoothly and yield positive results.

Ko agreed, saying that the forum should pay more attention to economic affairs “so that the event generates fewer disputes and proceeds more smoothly.”

Shanghai Vice Mayor Zhou Bo (周波) arrived at Taipei International Airport (Songshan airport) at about 11:30am leading a 135-member delegation.

They were confronted outside the airport by pro-independence protesters holding up banners that read: “Taiwan, China: one country on each side,” and shouting slogans.

However, they were confined to an “opinion expression zone” set up by police.

The Taipei Police Department dispatched about 600 police officers to the airport for crowd control.

Chilly Chen (陳峻涵), office director of the 908 Taiwan Republic Campaign, was dragged out of the airport by police.

Given the nature of the forum, Zhou should limit his discussion to exchanges between the two cities, Chilly Chen said.

“Do not think about doing ‘united front’ [work] here,” he added.

Zhou is participating in the forum on behalf of Shanghai Mayor Ying Yong (應勇), who was unable to attend because of scheduling conflicts.

The Shanghai official told those awaiting his arrival that the forum is the most important mechanism for exchanges across the Strait, and that he expected those in his delegation to make new friends and gain new knowledge.

Shanghai has launched a plan to position itself as a global financial, shipping and technology hub by 2035, Zhou said, adding that he was looking forward to sharing with Taipei counterparts experiences in urban development.

Keynote speeches about the circular economy are to be presented by Taipei Department of Urban Development Commissioner Lin Jou-min (林洲民) and Shanghai Municipal Development and Reform Commission Vice Director Zhou Qiang (周強), the Taipei City Government said.

Cultural development, urban renovation and environmental protection would also be covered, the city government said, adding that the two cities would sign three memorandums of understanding on cooperation.

After his arrival yesterday, Zhou visited power management solution provider Delta Electronics Inc (台達電), one of Taiwan’s biggest high-tech companies.

The city government last night hosted a banquet to welcome the Shanghai delegation.",Taiwan,2018.12
783,Citibank Taiwan wins Best Social Responsibility Award for good banking and finance practices - Taipei Times,"Citibank Taiwan wins Best Social Responsibility Award for good banking and finance practices

Citibank Taiwan is honored to have been presented with the Best Social Responsibility Award at the Taiwan Banking and Finance Best Practice Awards — known as the Oscars of the financial sector — which was hosted by the Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance in Taipei on Friday.

Having worked in the region for more than half a century, Citibank Taiwan not only wishes to be the best for our clients, but also wishes to embody this spirit when promoting corporate social responsibility for the company.

Citibank Taiwan’s promotion of corporate social responsibility would be made manifest in four fields: connection, inspiration, trust and innovation, Citibank Taiwan chairman Paulus Mok (莫兆鴻) said.

When it comes to corporate social responsibility, Citibank Taiwan no only seeks to surpass charity, but also anticipates to be the mover of social progression, Mok said.

As a leading figure in the financial sector, Citibank Taiwan aspires to take corporate social responsibility standards to a global level. With the UN’s 17 sustainable development goals (SDG) in mind, Citibank Taiwan attained 11 of them from 2016 to last year. This allows local companies to connect with the international community in the development of corporate social responsibility.

Citibank Taiwan has not only answered a call from the Executive Yuan’s Environmental Protection Administration to develop a circular economy and to cut down on plastics, but has also promoted the Financial Supervisory Commission’s Financial Inclusion System by offering financial management education, a strength of the bank.

With the administration and non-governmental organizations (NGO), including the Chi Sing Eco-conservation Foundation, the Taiwan Toy Library Association, the Taiwan Environmental Protection Union and the Homemakers United Foundation, Citibank Taiwan is dedicated to promoting a circular economy.

Adhering to the ideal of “reduce, recycle and reuse,” Citibank Taiwan employees, along with NGO partners, schools and the public, it can attain the goal of reducing plastic production.

Citibank Taiwan is also working closely with NGO partners to foster correct ideas of finance for young people through talks, workshops and consultation meetings.

With Citibank Taiwan’s Pathways to Progress program — one of many the bank has embarked on to foster vocational capabilities among young people — the company hopes to provide fresh graduates not only with a vision for the future, but also foster capabilities to help them become upstanding members of society.",Taiwan,2018.12
791,Urban Mining Has The Potential To Unlock India’s E-Waste Economy,"India’s consumer electronics market is one of the biggest in the world. While this augurs well for the state of the economy, it also leads to a huge amount of EEE – electronic and electrical equipment that gets discarded, better known as e-waste. With external factors such as hyped up Black Friday sales and government led Make in India policies leading to further device proliferation, e-waste levels are only going to rise further. Reports say that India will touch 3 million tons of e-waste by the end of 2018, and this is only the beginning.

The evolution of components used in these products is a fascinating field of study. However, devices are getting smaller and this hyperconvergence is leading to more minerals and components being packed closer together. Everything from the display to the circuit boards are made of precious metals. A single mobile phone contains all kinds of minerals such as Palladium, Copper, Silver, Gold and more – all of which have a huge aftersales market that is overlooked if people don’t dispose of their e-waste properly. Traditionally, people have discarded their e-waste through ‘kabaadi-walas’, a highly unorganized sector that involves dangerous manual labor and ineffective safety standards.

This is where urban mining comes into the picture. Urban mining is being called sustainability’s latest battleground, and in emerging countries such as India, this can play a huge role in environmental sustainability. Urban mining details the reclamation of secondary resources from urban waste and obsolete materials. In China, for instance, urban mining is providing a solution to the country’s resource crisis to meet its manufacturing needs and reduce its resource shortage. There’s no reason why such a solution cannot be successfully applied in India as well.

When it comes to the salvage of resources and precious metals, urban mining has immense potential. Research shows that $21 billion worth of materials can be saved through effective urban mining. The strategic implementation of urban mining plans can turn a city into a source for raw materials such as Iron, Copper, Aluminum, Lead and more. Not only can these minerals be used for further industries and processes, they can also be removed from the ground to prevent water and air contamination that leads to long-term health ailments.

But this can only be possible if e-waste is disposed in the right manner and reaches the right parties who know how to extract these minerals. Just how urban mining is providing a solution to China’s resource crisis, it can help India overcome its mineral resource shortage and reduce dependence on foreign imports to meet its manufacturing needs. With so many electronic devices in use throughout the country, we already have a readymade substitute for reducing the nation’s import bill, lowering the environmental burden and encouraging the ‘circular economy’.

A report from IIM Bangalore talks about the implications of urban mining in the context of building sustainable cities in India. Since the objective of urban mining is essentially safeguarding the environment and promoting resource conservation, its relevance in India cannot be underestimated. India is one of the largest consumers of materials in the world, and this demand can be substantially met by following the philosophy of reuse, reduce and recycle when it comes to e-waste and the materials within it.

E-waste thus represents a multi billion-dollar industry for the country, so long as e-waste is placed in the right channels. Urban mining represents a great opportunity for everyone to come together and make a lasting impact. As the collective goal of the nation is to enhance resource recovery and promote efficient consumption, end-to-end urban mining projects hold the key to a sustainable future. Effectively done, it can help shift the country away from import-heavy policies and reduce negative impacts on the environment caused by precious metals that are causing more damage than we can imagine. Thus, it is our collective responsibility to propagate the concept of urban mining in the country.",India,2018.12

844,"Italy making improvement in trash treatment, but still lags behind neighbors - Xinhua | English.news.cn","ROME, Dec. 11 (Xinhua) -- Italy continues to trail the European Union (EU) as a whole on waste treatment, though the country is closing the gap with its European neighbors, according to a recent key report released by the technical and research branch of Italy's Ministry of Environment.

The Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research -- best known by its Italian initials, ISPRA -- told lawmakers on Monday that while Italy has made strides toward what is known as the ""circular economy"", there was still much to do.

The ""circular economy"" seeks reducing the amount of waste products create, making products last longer before being discarded, and then recycling the waste that is created to produce new goods or energy without extracting new natural resources.

Italy has been among the European Union's laggards when it came to effectiveness in reducing and effectively disposing of waste. The ISPRA report indicated that is beginning to change.

ISPRA's 27th annual report on urban waste was its most comprehensive yet, measuring waste production and disposal in urban areas in all 20 Italian regions all set out in a report totaling more than 600 pages.

Overall, urban waste production in Italy has more or less plateaued in recent years: oscillating over the last five years from a low of 29.52 million metric tons of waste to a high of 30.11 million tons. The total for 2017 -- the latest year covered by the report -- was 29.59 million, a decline of 1.7 percent compared to the previous year and virtually identical as in 2013.

That decline was more or less consistent across the country, with just four of 20 regions showing an increase in waste production between 2016 and 2017.

On a per-capita basis, Italy produced a total of 497 kilograms of waste per resident per year, only slightly higher than the average for the European Union as a whole.

But when it comes to disposing of that waste in low- impact ways, the data told a different tale: 55.5 percent of the waste in Italy is separated by categories, up slightly compared to the previous year, well below EU averages.

""All the regions have taken a step forward and for the first time the amount of differentiated waste totals more than 55 percent,"" Stefano Laporta, ISPRA president, said Monday. ""But there is no room to be complacent.""

Salvatore Micillo, undersecretary with the Ministry of Environment, and Stefano Vignaroli, president of parliament's Commission on the Circular Economy, also spoke at the presentation of the ISPRA report, making similar remarks.

Organic waste in Italy totaled 6.6 million tons, an increase of just 1.6 percent compared to 2016, the smallest year-on-year increase since 2010. The amount of incinerated waste totaled 5.3 million tons, down around 2.5 percent compared to the previous year, but also higher than European averages. The recovery of packaging waste was around 78 percent in 2017, stable compared to 2016.",China,2018.12
861,Thai water sports company wants to take back its historical emissions,"Feeling remorseful about the environmental impact of his company, Svein Rasmussen is on a mission to make amends for all the emissions it has produced in 25 years of operations.

The Norwegian national began offsetting his company’s annual emissions through a mangrove tree planting project in Thor Heyerdahl Climate Park in Myanmar four years ago, he told Eco-Business in a recent interview about Starboard, his Bangkok-based business that produces water sports equipment such as paddleboards and windsurfers.

“We’re reducing between 15 and 20 per cent of our emissions, but reductions are incremental and will not get us to zero carbon. But when you plant mangrove trees, that’s when you get momentous change,” Rasmussen said.

Mangrove trees, which grow in coastal areas in saltwater, have been found to remove up to five times as much carbon dioxide from the air as rainforest trees, storing it in their leaves, branches and in the soil.

Starboard has been planting mangroves to offset an amount of carbon dioxide 10 times the size of its annual footprint, with the ultimate aim of taking back every kilogram of carbon it has ever released. It has planted 140,000 trees in the park so far.

“It’s hard to go back in time, so all we can do is estimate our footprint from the last 25 years and plant enough trees to see that it is taken care of,” explained Rasmussen.

The company last month mooted the idea of a plastic bag fee at an Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting in Bangkok, and organises clean-ups of waterways in Bangkok. “Oceans are filling up so quickly that we don’t have time for the usual [slow] evolution of policies,” he stressed. “We want to connect with any major influencing party, from the military to the chamber of commerce, to fast track the evolution of plastic regulations.”

At the same time, the company is getting its house in order when it comes to plastic use. Starboard joined the Plastic Disclosure Project by the non-profit Ocean Recovery Alliance, under which companies measure the amount of plastic they use and aim to reduce it in the long term. Starboard ran a plastic audit last year.

“When we did the calculations, it dawned on me that most of the boards and products that we make come from fossil fuels,” he told Eco-Business. “The paint, the mat on top of the paddleboard, the resins—all of it.”

Ninety per cent of the raw materials the company used in production were derived from these finite resources. “That means 90 per cent of our profits come from fossil fuels even though we don’t use single-use packaging. I felt very guilty,” said the Norwegian-born water sports enthusiast.

This drove Starboard to look for ways to reduce its plastic use and carbon footprint, and enable other organisations to do the same.

Last year Starboard launched what it calls the world’s first Plastic Offset Programme in partner with the Ocean Recovery Alliance, encouraging other firms to take a hard look at and improve their plastic use.

The company assigned a financial value to the social and environmental cost of using plastic, and channeled that money into a fund for research and development and supported non-government organisations that combat ocean plastic.

“We have created a fund based on the plastic used in our products, which we will invest back into projects that protect the ocean—our greatest resource and the big blue playground for paddlers and windsurfers worldwide,” said Rasmussen in a statement.

Starboard also searched for better ways to manufacture its products and reuse plastic. Even if an item is made of durable plastic, companies need to consider how these can be disposed of at the end of their lifespan, Rasmussen said.

“We need to look at how we can reduce the amount of plastic that goes into a product, how the plastic can come from recycled or bio sources, and what is an acceptable end of life system for it,” he elaborated.

Plastic has come under the spotlight in the last two years as the social and environmental impacts of the miracle material of the 20th century became increasingly clear to the general public.

Microplastics, formed when plastic waste is carried out to sea and broken up into smaller pieces, is consumed by sea life that forms part of the human food chain. The tiny bits of plastic were recently found in human excrement for the first time.

Plastic pollution is also killing marine life including, most recently, a sperm whale that was found washed up on a beach in Indonesia with more than 1,000 pieces of plastic in its stomach.

Earlier this year Starboard announced that it had begun manufacturing parts of its products with plastic salvaged from discarded fishing nets, leading to a 14.4 per cent drop in the company’s emissions through a partnership with DSM.

The Dutch multinational works with coastal communities in India who collect, clean and process the nets so they can be converted back into plastic material called Akulon Repurposed that is sold to manufacturers for production.

Around 2,000 tonnes of nets are collected and recycled each year through DSM’s programme, which has created jobs for 300 individuals in low-income coastal communities, said Matt Gray, commercial director for Asia Pacific at DSM Engineering Plastics.

It’s a drop in the ocean compared to the 640,000 tonnes of nets that make up 10 per cent of all plastic waste in the sea. Explaining the focus on fishing nets, Gray told Eco-Business that fishing nets are a good source of plastic because they are made of nylon, a material that DSM already makes.

“It’s a true circular economy. We use nylon-based fishing nets and fishing lines, and we’re pulling the material back out of the environment,” he said.

Fishing nets are also easy to clean and recycle, while general plastic waste is easily contaminated and therefore unusable, he added. “It is necessary to capture as much value from waste streams as possible, which is an idea that’s central to the concept of a circular economy.”

The Akulon Repurposed feedstock DSM produces may be reinforced with glass - depending on how the feedstock is intended to be used - to ensure that the materials perform to the same levels as new plastic, and already outdoes other forms of recycled nylon available in the market, said Gray.

Besides using upcycled plastic, Starboard replaced 33 per cent of the fossil fuel-based resin it needs with a recyclable, plant-based bioresin that resulted in a 20.7 per cent reduction in carbon emissions. The manufacturer’s plastic usage totalled 317.96 tonnes in 2017, which fell to 298.5 tonnes by 2018.

Does Rasmussen foresee a world that could be completely plastic free?

“Let’s put it like this—plastic will always be there, but in a more useful way, like prosthetic limbs. It is silly to use such a fantastic material for single-use items,” he said.

Rasmussen added: “We also need to think about [recycling waste] differently. DSM is are doing what we’ve needed to do for a long time, namely retrieve the waste in nature today and find an economic model that works.”",Singapore,2018.12
863,IMF wants Pakistan to tackle circular debt: Questions failure to fully implement last strategy to,"ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) in consultation with other multilateral creditors has asked Pakistan to come up with a comprehensive strategy for tackling Rs1.3 trillion circular debt on short, medium and long-term basis.

The Fund has also asked as to why the last strategy for ending circular debt could not be fully implemented after completion of the programme in November 2016. “Reversal of policies and lackluster attitude on reform path has played havoc with the country’s economy,” the IMF and Pakistan team agreed during the parleys and then both sides evolved a consensus for preparing a new strategy to stop unbearable losses for the cash-bleeding power sector.

“The total amount of circular debt has gone around Rs1.3 trillion and the government is preparing a comprehensive strategy to tackle both stocks and flows of circular debt,” top official sources confirmed to The News on Saturday. The stocks of circular dent stood at Rs582 billion and flow at Rs690 billion and this amount is increasing every month. This amount of circular debt, they said, might have gone on higher side because this loss was piling up on a monthly basis.

“We are preparing a strategy which will be firmed up within one and a half months,” said top official sources. Now the strategy, they said, was focusing on tackling finding ways for subsidy provided to the AJK government on power as well as to Balochistan on tube wells.

The IMF team that visited Pakistan in November last seriously took up the issue of circular debt and argued that the policy of tackling circular debt was reversed in the aftermath of completion of the last Fund program as it stood at just around Rs350 billion which had now peaked to around Rs1.3 trillion. “The reversal of policies on many fronts is the main cause of existing quagmire which Pakistan’s economy is witnessing currently,” the IMF team assessed and endorsed by Ministry of Finance during the parleys. The loose fiscal policy had also put pressures on external front of economy but the overvalued exchange rate proved disastrous for the economy. On circular debt, the IMF assessed that the strategy to tackle circular debt lost its steam resulting into piling up of this monster again after November 2016. “Now Pakistan will have to undertake a comprehensive package, including rationalisation of tariff, plugging leakages, allowing Nepra to notify and implement determined tariff automatically and improving governance structure to overcome woes of cash bleeding power sector,” the IMF prescription given to Pakistan suggests.

When contacted, one top official of Power Division said the government had instructed them to prepare a strategy on this front and this task was underway not on the demand of the IMF but the government considered it in the best interest of the sector to implement all actions required to avoid piling up of circular debt up to such an extent in future.

The IMF sources said Pakistan will have to undertake short, medium and long-term policies to improve its economy.

They said parleys would continue between the two sides to strike consensus at staff level agreement, as it is the only way for presenting Pakistan’s case before the Fund executive board in months ahead.",Pakistan,2018.12

867,EU urged to commit significant increase in climate commitments by 2020,"As the first week of the crucial UN climate summit ended this weekend, businesses, investors, local authorities, trade unions and NGOs on Sunday called upon the European Union to commit to significantly increase the current climate commitments by 2020, in order to secure a successful outcome of the summit.

Stakeholders standing together as the Coalition for Higher Ambition urged the EU governments attending the 24th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as COP24, to respond to the landmark 1.5 degrees Celsius Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report with urgency and also scaled up ambition.

The first week of the talks delivered limited progress on technical issues, but most decisions that are expected from this COP, including a commitment to strengthen all countries' climate pledges by 2020, are left to the ministers, who will be attending the summit this coming week.

To stimulate progress of the talks, the EU needs to do its best to convince all countries to support such a commitment, including by pledging to substantially increase its own climate targets.

With its new draft long-term strategy calling for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, the EU brought new ambition to the negotiating table, but it is the increase of the short-term emission cuts by 2030 that will make or break our response to the climate crisis.

Wendel Trio, Director of Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe, told IANS in a statement: ""The first week of the climate summit was full of bad news on emissions reaching all-time highs and targets not matching the demands of science.""

""It is clear that governments are not keeping the promises they made three years ago when the Paris Agreement was signed. The second week of the COP is the last chance to correct the course.

""We urge EU leaders to show leadership and ambition, and commit to increase the EU's 2030 target even beyond the 55 per cent reduction some member states and the European Parliament are calling for,"" Trio added.

Yann Francoise, Head of climate, energy and circular economy strategies in Paris, said: ""Achieving Paris agreement is already a priority of numerous EU cities. The city of Paris adopted in last March its new Climate Actions Plan to be carbon neutral by 2050 for a fair, inclusive and resilient city.""

""To achieve this ambition, all policies local, regional, national and European should be aligned. The EU should increase its ambition. Thirty years is a short period to achieve this transition which claims social justice initiatives as the same level than mitigation and adaptation solutions. Cities act, have solutions, cities are ready to work together.""

Mir Roca Montserrat, Confederal Secretary of European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC), said: ""Scientists and citizens marching in the streets are reminding us that the climate clock is ticking. The ETUC supports the objective of a net-zero emissions EU in 2050, but reaching that objective requires much more ambitious milestones for 2030 and 2040.""

Achieving net zero emissions by 2050 is a viable target for the overall EU economy and a source of opportunities for value and job creation, added Miguel Angel Munoz, head of climate policies.

Experts say the priority outcome at the COP24, which will conclude on December 14, will be the finalisation of the ""Paris rulebook"", a Bible for transparent implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement -- the first global treaty to reduce emissions by all rich and poor nations.

The COP24 negotiations, which will see participation of more than 20,000 people from nearly 200 countries, are going to be held in the backdrop of grim news on climate change from three UN bodies.

India, one of the participants, has committed itself to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions intensity of gross domestic product (EIGDP) by 33-35 per cent below the 2005 levels by 2030, according to UN

EIGDP is the amount of greenhouse gas emissions created by a unit of GDP.

Indian Minister Harsh Vardhan, who was attending the summit, said the high level of greenhouse gas emission was a major concern and reaffirmed that India would play a ""positive, constructive and balanced role"" in the climate summit.

He said India is working hard for achieving the 175 GW target for installed Renewable Energy capacity by 2022.",India,2018.12
885,Climathon event empowers students to take control of their future,"Students and academics from across Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University have joined forces to participate in the global 24-hour Climathon event with the aim of finding new ways to tackle environmental challenges in Suzhou.

The XJTLU team joined participants from 113 cities in 67 countries around the world who took part in the hackathon-style event, which encouraged ordinary citizens to contribute to sustainable development in their own cities.

Approximately 50 XJTLU students were divided into 12 groups, each tasked with finding the solution to a specific question related to either Human Behaviour and Circular Economy within a 24-hour time period.

In the Circular Economy category, a group who developed the ‘Cleanathon’ – a product capable of filtering out microfibers produced during the laundry process – took out both the first prize and the popularity prize in the category.

The group, which comprised Eva Carocci from the BEng Industrial Design programme, Adit Rastogi from the BA Marketing programme, Xiaoyang Zhou from the BEng Architecture programme and Wenqing Gao from the BSc Financial Mathematics programme, came up with the design to address the issue of unfiltered microfibres polluting the ocean.

“The design of Cleanathon is based on the existing Cora Ball, which can collect and filter one third of the microfibres produced during the laundry process,” said Adit.

“Our goal is to promote Cleanathon to hotels and residential neighbourhoods so that the technology can have a larger market and therefore play an important role in protecting our oceans and our own health.”

Fellow student Eva said she believed the key to the group’s success was teamwork.

“We all come from different departments, and our areas of expertise really complemented each other,” said Eva.

A group who developed an app designed to help XJTLU staff and students exchange and trade unused items was the winning team in the Human Behaviour category.

The group consisted of Naomi Riteco from the MSc Media and Communication programme, Daniel Francis from the MSc Financial Mathematics programme, Xingyan Wang from the BSc Biological Sciences programme and Ziye Xia from the BA Human Resource Management programme.

Dr Barbara Wong, from the Department of Industrial Design, was the team leader and one of the key organisers of the event. She said Climathon required a combination of innovation and insight of the users and environmental problems to find the real problem and an effective solution.

“Climathon participants need a range of different skills – creativity and design thinking, basic prototyping skills, the ability to communicate well and a real sense of team spirit,” said Dr Wong.

“The critical element of the Climathon is that it looks at innovative ideas and business viability, as well as environmental solutions. The groups need to make thorough considerations about the feasibility and business model to guarantee its sustainability.”

The XJTLU students benefited from a range of mentors, who were also the organisers, from the University during the Climathon event, including Dr Ellen Touchstone from the International Business School Suzhou, Dr. Marco Cimillo from the Department of Architecture, Dr Paola Pellegrin from the Department of Urban Planning and Design, and Dr Zheng Feei Ma from the Department of Health and Environmental Sciences.

The event was supported by five departments in XJTLU, including the Department of Industrial Design, Department of Urban Planning and Design, Department of Health and Environmental Sciences, Department of Architecture, and the International Business School Suzhou. Two student clubs – the XJTLU Design Association and Oikos Suzhou – played a key role in the organisation of the event including undertaking promotion activities, recruitment and material preparations.

56,Zero-waste economy blooms in the city,"BENGALURU: Garbage produced in thousands of tonnes, overflow the road sides of Bengaluru. The title of ‘Garden City’ is tarnished with the reek of garbage in the air. But in the midst of this stink and doom, a new trend has emerged as a breath of fresh air among the environmentally conscious. Many residents are switching to a zero-waste lifestyle where no trash makes it’s way to landfills. This minimal means of living requires decomposable, eco-friendly substitutes for everyday products. City Express speaks to owners of sustainable companies to understand the trend.

“It is not just about selling products. It is about encouraging an earth-friendly lifestyle,” says Sahar Mansoor, CEO and founder of Bare Necessities. Her company is first in the country to produce high quality, zero waste products such as compostable toothbrushes, lip balms, detergents, reusable straws.

They also provide consultation services to go zero waste for businesses as well as for personal and corporate events. Save Globe India uses raw-materials like bamboo, jute, coconut coir, rice husk, ridge gourd and other sources from nature to manufacture their products.

“We saw how plastic ruins nature, so we began our mission to educate people by conducting campaigns for corporates and apartments, on the availability of natural products that come from nature and go back to nature without costing our planet,” says Harika, co-founder of the company. Celebrations should not become a burden on the planet, says Pooja Dixit. Her company Spill Savers is the first of its kind in the city to rent out reusable cutlery for small events with an aim to reduce the number of disposables going to landfills. Since last year, Boondh – a social enterprise that provides menstrual cup for affordable prices, claims to have reduced 1,68,000 kg of non-biodegradable menstrual waste.

Awareness is the driving force for these startups. “All around Bengaluru, residents have taken the initiative to set up cutlery banks so that there is easier access to renting. We have a WhatsApp group of 13 people from various parts of the city for this cause,” says Dixit. A government enforced ban on plastic disposables compels citizens to switch to alternative, zero waste services. Companies too use such approaches to optimise operations and as a corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy. Save Globe India supplies cloth bags, food containers, and cutlery to major corporates like CCD, TAJ Group of Hotels, Sheraton, ISKON, and WWF.

Lack of automation is a major challenge and results in limited production capacity. Harika explains, “The more automated the production process is, the more the carbon footprint”. The ubiquity of plastic makes it difficult to find alternatives. Not every plastic product can be replaced. For Spill Savers the challenge lies in logistics. “There are two trips while renting, one for the drop and another for the pickup. With Bengaluru traffic and transportation charges, sometimes the transportation cost is more than the rental cost,” explains Dixit.

Expanding the consumer base for zero-waste products will impel corporate giants to enter the market. “At the teething stages of the zero-waste menstruation economy, we hope with similar stakeholders to attempt to reach at least five per cent of India’s menstruating population in the next five years,” says Bharti from Boondh. The enterprises are less product oriented and more driven by social purpose. Mansoor says, “Bare Necessities seeks to change the narrative on waste in India.

In the future, we hope to become a place for policy analysts to work with local government on policy recommendations to manage our waste better, to reduce our waste. A place for behavioural economics, ecologists, researchers and consumers alike to build the ecosystem towards a circular economy.”",India,2018.12
65,Harnessing the Fourth Industrial Revolution for the Circular Economy: Consumer Electronics and Plastics Packaging,"In collaboration with Accenture Strategy, the World Economic Forum is excited to announce the publication of a new whitepaper on the 24th of January, at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos.

The whitepaper is published as part of the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE), a public‑private collaboration mechanism and project accelerator dedicated to bringing about the circular economy at speed and scale.

The whitepaper examines the plastics packaging and consumer electronicsindustries. It looks at how Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies are used today, and what could be possible in the near future to manage our resources better. The report illustrates 19 Fourth Industrial Revolution solutions that can be applied to accelerate the circular transition in the plastics packaging and consumer electronics sectors. These range from the Internet of Materials and AI‑based design tools through to hyper‑intelligent sorting and disassemblysupported by machine vision and robotics.

We are immensely excited by the ideas that have surfaced in this research, but realize we have only scratched the surface. It is our hope that leaders will be inspired to build on these beginnings and explore the technologies and scale the solutions that will overcome the challenges in these two material streams to build a more circular system and unlock the $4.5 trillion opportunity of the circular economy.

122,Env & health at increasing risk from growing weight of e-waste,"Env & health at increasing risk from growing weight of e-waste

United Nations, Jan 26 (UNI) Around 50 million tonnes of electronic waste, or e-waste, is being thrown away each year, according to a new joint United Nations report – which exceeds the combined weight of all the commercial airliners ever made, or alternatively, enough Eiffel Towers to fill the whole of Manhattan.

To highlight the rising challenge posed by mountains of discarded electronics worldwide, seven UN entities came together to launch the report at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday, in a bid to offer some solutions to a behemoth-sized problem that is making the world sicker and adding to environmental degradation.

The joint report, entitled, “A New Circular Vision for Electronics – Time for a Global Reboot”, calls for a new vision for e-waste based on the “circular economy” concept, whereby a regenerative system can minimise waste and energy leakage.

“E-waste is a growing global challenge that poses a serious threat to the environment and human health worldwide”, said Stephan Sicars, Director of the Department of Environment at the UN Industrial Development Organization. “To minimise this threat, UNIDO works with various UN agencies and other partners on a range of e-waste projects, all of which are underpinned by a circular economy approach”.

According to the report, a deliberative process must be instilled to change the system – one that collaborates with major brands, small and medium-sized enterprises, academia, trade unions and civil society.

Considerable work is already under way to harness a circular economy. For example, the Nigerian Government, the Global Environment Facility and UN Environment announced a $2 million investment to formalize an e-waste recycling industry in Nigeria. The new investment will leverage over $13 million in additional financing from the private sector. 

“Thousands of tonnes of e-waste is disposed of by the world’s poorest workers in the worst of conditions, putting their health and lives at risk”, maintained Guy Ryder, Director-General, International Labour Organisation (ILO). “We need better e-waste strategies and green standards as well as closer collaboration between governments, employers and unions to make the circular economy work for both people and planet.”

Despite growing e-waste, “A New Circular Vision” points to the importance of technologies from the so-called Internet of Things – a network of devices that contain electronics and the connectivity that allows them to exchange data – through to cloud computing advances, which can all result in smarter recycling and tracking of e-waste.

“A circular economy brings with it tremendous environmental and economic benefits for us all” said Joyce Msuya, Acting Executive Director, UN Environment Programme (UN Environment). “Our planet’s survival will depend on how well we retain the value of products within the system by extending their life.”

The report supports the work of the E-waste Coalition, which includes International Labour Organisation (ILO); International Telecommunication Union (ITU); United Nations Environment Programme (UN Environment); United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO); United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR); United Nations University (UNU) and Secretariats of the Basel and Stockholm Conventions.

124,Coca-Cola India launches grape based sparkling drink Colour in TN,"Beverages major Coca-Cola India on Friday expanded its Minute Maid product range by launching a grape fruit based sparkling drink branded as Colour, said a top company official.

People in Tamil Nadu towns and villages used to call soft drink 'Colour'. Coca-Cola India has branded its new grape juice sparkler as 'Colour' to resonate with the local lingo.

He also said the company would launch a new product in Andhra Pradesh that would be branded under a similar philosophy.

""The new grape juice based Colour is launched here and will be focused on Tamilian population within India. The product is part of our strategy of expanding our fruit based beverages,"" T.Krishnakumar, President, Coca-Cola India and South West Asia, told reporters here.

He said the company apart from focusing on its core products -carbonated drinks - also concentrates on launching products preferred in regional markets and also on expanding the 'fruit circular economy' - launching fruit based drinks made with domestically grown fruits.

""The black grapes for the drink are sourced from grape farmers in South India,"" Krishnakumar said.

He did not agree that the new brand 'Colour' under the broader Minute Maid brand would reduce the latter's brand equity. Minute Maid brand is known as a fruit based beverage brand.

""We are expanding the products under the Minute Maid brand. The new product has 12 per cent grape juice content,"" Krishnakumar said.

According to Srideep Kesavan, Director-Juices, Coca-Cola India and South West Asia, research showed that grape juice was a fast moving product at fruit juice stalls in Tamil Nadu.

Queried about cutting down on the sugar content in the company's beverages, Krishnakumar said it will come down soon and a start has been made with the grape sparkler Colour with 9.5 grams of sugar.

On the value of fruit pulp/products that Coca-Cola India would source under its 'fruit circular economy' he said the company had committed that a sum of Rs.5,000 crore would be spent on that head by 2023 and the company is in line with that commitment.",India,2019.01
125,FNB News - Mondelez International joins Loop initiative to reduce packaging waste | FNB News,"Mondelez International recently joined the Loop initiative, which was founded by recycling leader TerraCycle and aims to tackle packaging waste with a first-of-its-kind subscription-based shopping model for distributing consumer goods to homes in reusable containers.

162,WEF recognises EC as champion in circular economy,"Davos, Jan 23 (UNI) The European Commission (EC) has been awarded the 2019 Circular Economy Prize by the World Economic Forum and the Forum of Young Global Leaders as recognition of the work done to accelerate the transition towards a circular economy that protects the environment and reduces greenhouse gas emissions while delivering opportunities for jobs, growth and investment.

The EC was awarded the prize on Monday evening in Davos.

In 2015, the EC had established a unique comprehensive strategy, the Circular Economy Package, aiming to close the resource loop by introducing measures covering the whole lifecycle of products and materials – from production and consumption to management of waste and its re-use as secondary raw materials in the economy. 

The suggested measures also tackle climate change with energy savings and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and include the first-ever European Strategy for Plastics. 

The Commission has delivered more than 90pc of the 54 planned actions. A circular economy is part of the modernisation and transformation needed for the EU to become the world's first major economy to go climate neutral by 2050, as per the long-term strategy put forward by the Commission in November 2018. 

Furthermore, the Commission is currently reflecting on which steps are now needed to make Europe ever more sustainable.

203,Giving food waste a new lease of life,"Growing tomato plants in a rooftop garden at One Tampines Hub. The true tipping point comes when food and retail enterprises across the board make food waste management a business priority that is built-in - both physically in business operation frameworks and strategically in business plans.

THE world is gradually transitioning from a linear to a circular economy, as we move towards a new economic model of collaborative consumption.

Along with this paradigm shift, the ""take-make-waste"" linear consumption model of traditional industries is quickly falling out of favour with the proponents of a new circular economy globally wherein the traditional dynamics of supply and demand are fundamentally transformed. For good reason, a change is necessary. The world now produces in excess of a billion tonnes of garbage every year, much of which goes into landfill and incineration if not exported and recycled.

Ensuring that industries make their output restorative in design is now crucial to sustaining economic growth without putting our environment in jeopardy.

With the festive season around the corner, it is perhaps timely to discuss the often-overlooked issue of food waste management. In a waste audit conducted in 2017, the National Environment Agency (NEA) found that more than half of food waste generated by Singapore households could have been avoided if people adopted a more prudent approach towards managing their food.

According to the United Nations, some 1.3 billion tonnes of food produced in the world is wasted every year. In Singapore alone, food waste has risen 40 per cent over the past 10 years, from 568,000 tonnes disposed by households and the food industry in 2008 to around 809,800 tonnes in 2017. This made up 23 per cent of total waste disposed of in Singapore in 2017, with only 16 per cent recycled.

The good news is food waste management can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally, because the treatment of food waste, unlike metals or plastics, is much less complex, as there are no special treatments required to process food waste.

In fact, effective food waste management is a fundamental aspect behind the circular economy of food. The idea is that taking food waste through a value-extracting biodegradation process, which closes nutrient loops and regenerates the biosphere by increasing the amount of nutrients recycled, gives life to new generations of plants and animals in an ecological food chain.

While there is a variety of food waste management solutions in the market to choose from, common barriers such as the limited space and availability of recycling facilities, transportation costs associated with moving waste, and the complexities of collecting and segregating food waste, have largely inhibited the wider adoption of waste management today.

For every food company that is responsibly maximising the utility cycles of its produce and reducing its environmental wastage, there exist many others which are making a wasteland out of their unused output.

On a global level, this is a major concern as the United Nations has made halving per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer level, and reducing food losses along production and supply chains, by 2030 as its key development goals of ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns.

In Singapore, reducing food waste is part of our core initiatives towards a zero-waste nation, a key focus area of our Sustainable Singapore Blueprint.

There are multiple factors that we need to consider in order to eliminate food waste, from minimising food wastage at source from agriculture and optimising supply chain management to transforming the consumer mindset.

The true tipping point comes when food and retail enterprises across the board make food waste management a business priority that is built-in - both physically in business operation frameworks and strategically in business plans.

To this end, it is heartening to see that many retail establishments in Singapore have started to incorporate food waste management into their daily operations.

For example, local grocery chain NTUC FairPrice in 2014 developed a food waste reduction framework to engage community and partners through enhancing internal processes, public education, and partnerships such as its partnership with Food from the Heart. It has also developed a Food Waste Index in Singapore to track and sustain food waste reduction efforts, which helped to raise greater public awareness of food waste.

Using another approach of recycling food waste, two hawker centres in Ang Mo Kio and Tiong Bahru have also piloted a food waste recycling system that converts food waste into either compost/fertiliser or non-potable water for general washing and cleaning.

Aside from retail establishments, real estate developers and facility managers can also play a crucial role in influencing the adoption of sustainability measures by the occupants of their developments.

For instance, landlords are now introducing the concept of a ""green lease"", which incorporates various sustainability measurements into tenancy agreements and collectively boosting the green performance of the building. Building owners are working with tenants on the waste segregation requiring space planning and training of tenant staff for effective waste segregation.

When it comes to food waste management, a developer can make a significant difference in helping tenants manage food waste from the get-go. For instance, businesses and building managers may find it difficult to manage food waste due to logistical problems such as a lack of space to house waste management equipment. This may be addressed if a food waste processing system was incorporated into a building infrastructure at its design stage.

In fact, shopping malls such as Parkway Parade and Jem have in recent years adopted on-site waste management systems such as composting or anaerobic biodigesters that convert the food waste into compost for landscaping purposes or water for non-potable use.

Commercial and industrial premises such as hotels, F&B outlets, schools and even government buildings have recognised the need to reduce their environmental impact, and many of them are already utilising similar on-site food waste management solutions and practices.

No doubt more can be done by real estate developers and property managers to evaluate their approaches to waste management and lead from the ground up.

Short of limiting public consumption, resource regeneration is the nexus between a circular economy and a zero-waste nation. To this end, initiatives have already begun to educate and create awareness about sustainable living that can be adopted in stages, particularly in homes, schools, workplaces and F&B establishments where food waste is most common.

Ultimately, to advance towards a resource-efficient circular economy, governments, businesses and consumers can collaborate to make a concerted effort towards extending the utility cycle of our excess output and giving waste a new lease of life. Only then can we recreate our industrial ecology in a truly sustainable way that works for, and not against, our environment to become a zero-waste nation.

280,Do you have a solution to the biggest challenge in human history?,"It is the biggest challenge humanity has ever faced: how can we reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere to avoid the most catastrophic effects of global warming?

According to a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we have just over a decade to do so. Citing this report, Professor Michael Maniates, the head of environmental studies at Yale-NUS College told a 100-strong audience in Singapore on Thursday: “We are approaching the carbon cliff.”

“We need to radically reduce our emissions. We shouldn’t kid ourselves, it’s going to be difficult. We need to find solutions that are aggressive, targeted and can spread,” said Maniates at the launch of The Liveability Challenge, a global competition to find solutions to the world’s toughest problems.

Finding ways to almost half emissions by 2030, which the IPCC report says is required, is the objective of the initiative, a Temasek Foundation Ecosperity-supported programme that is offering up to S$1 million (US$734,000) in funding for ideas that change the way we produce and consume energy and resources.

Other finalists will also get the opportunity to win a fundraising campaign worth up to S$500,000, a place on an incubator programme, and a mentorship opportunity with Circular Economy Club, a network of professionals who work in the circular economy space.

The Liveability Challenge Grand Finale, where finalists will pitch to a panel of judges, will take place on 7 June during Ecosperity Week in Singapore.

A solution that sucks, in a good way

This is the second year of the Challenge, which was won in 2018 by Singapore firm RWDC Industries with a drinking straw made from waste cooking oil.

Winning the Challenge has generated the capital and interest from corporate investors and customers RWDC needed to move the straws from idea to reality. Speaking to Eco-Business on the sidelines of the event last week, Zhaotan Xiao, RWDC’s Asia Pacific president, said the timing of his company’s idea was key to its success.

“We picked the right product to make at the right time. The world suddenly moved to ban straws as a reaction against single-use plastic. Companies were scrambling for solutions, and we could give them one quickly and easily,” he said of the straw made from polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), a material that takes just three months to decompose in normal conditions.

RWDC made a prototype of the biodegradable straw in November, and is working with corporates to put the straws into production in the United States. But first it needs approval from the Food and Drug Administration that the product is safe to use commercially at scale.

Xiao expects the straws to be in commercial-scale production by this time next year.

The time it takes to produce the solutions needed to meet the IPCC’s 12-year deadline is a concern for Martin Lim, co-founder of Electrify, Southeast Asia’s first e-commerce platform for electricity that launched last July, who spoke at the event.

Lim told Eco-Business: “If you invest in technology today, it’s won’t come to market tomorrow. You’ve got to develop it, trial it, get it passed regulators. It maybe four years until it’s commercially viable.”

Even online retail giant Amazon took 10 years to establish itself, and sustainability solutions are usually physical inventions that take longer to produce and distribute than pure digital products, he said.

“We can change, we have to change. But we’re not going to reverse climate change. We’ve passed that point. We’re not going to make it. The timing is just wrong,” said Lim.

However, he added that business solutions “will save the world.”

“We don’t have superheroes to bail us out. Individuals galvanising a movement can only go so far. So what’s going to change the world? Business. Why? Because of incentives,” he said, pointing to how feed-in tariffs have kick-started solar energy markets in Asia.

“If I paid you to consume less power, you would do it. If I paid you to consume more solar energy, you would do it,” he said.

To bring about a dramatic reduction in emissions, will systems such as agriculture, and manufacturing need to be completely re-engineered? “Should we be propping up an existing system or do we creatively destruct it,” asked Jiehui Kia, principal strategist at sustainability non-profit Forum for the Future.

The Liveability Challenge contenders need to show a clear vision for how their solutions have the potential to not just solve a problem, but transform an entire system, Kia said. Using RWDC’s biodegradable straw as an example, she said solutions were needed that “go beyond the straw, to transform how packaging works.”

She pointed at the palm oil sector as one industry that could be transformed by using waste biomass to generate electricity, although currently doing so is highly inefficient. “If we could find a solution to turning biomass into electricity that is as efficient as diesel, we could transform not only palm oil but other sectors such as manufacturing,” she said.

While the focus of The Liveability Challenge is on technology, it should not be the only focus in a world of growing inequality and social tension, Maniates commented in his keynote speech.

“A fortress world is looking increasingly likely, where the rich hide behind walls and the poor are left to fend for themselves,” said Maniates as he pondered a future ravaged by extreme weather. “With an increase in climate refugees, people are getting more grumpy with one another.”

“Will the future give us 1,000 Donald Trumps or 1,000 Desmond Tutus? Will we have a 1,000 Mother Theresas or 1,000 Adolf Hitlers?” he wondered.

With the growing prospect of conflict as climate tensions rise, he said it was critical to find solutions that “have attributes that nurture qualities that allow us to rise to the challenges ahead.”

In times of crisis, humans tend to turn inwards and become more susceptible to fear and hate, so solutions are needed that can nurture compassion, empathy and connection, said Maniates, citing the playground movement as an example of how fractured communities were brought together during the industrial revolution in the US in the late 19th century.

“We know that when people work together in community they are more willing to sacrifice more for the future. Technology helps us solve a physical problem, but it can also make us better human beings by working together.”

Referencing Maniates’s comments, Jessica Cheam, managing editor of Eco-Business added: “The Liveability Challenge is also a playground — for sustainability ideas and solutions to grow and scale, and to match investors and raise capital to make these solutions a reality.”

“Together with all our partners, we are very excited to be launching this year’s edition of the Challenge and look forward to receiving ideas from all over the world,” she said.

The Liveability Challenge was officially launched on 10th January and welcomes submissions until 5 April in the areas of energy and circular economy.

283,Netherlands to seek further collaboration wit...,"TAICHUNG (Taiwan News) — For the year of 2019, the Dutch representative office in Taiwan anticipates further collaboration with both Taiwan’s central and municipal governments on the fields of circular economy, high technology, as well as cultural affairs.

Speaking at the Holland Pavilion, built by the Netherlands Trade and Investment Office in Taipei (NTIO) in partnership with 44 public and private entities in Taiwan and the Netherlands for the Taichung International Flora Exposition, the Dutch representative to Taiwan, Guy Wittich, said he will visit local governments on the island in the following months in hope of promoting the concept and applications of circular economy.

The Netherlands has been focused on the development of circular economy over the years. Wittich believes that the technology sector and various industries in Taiwan are already equipped with knowledge and techniques necessary for developing circular economy, and hence the Netherlands anticipates more cooperation with the nation.

On the other hand, Wittich encouraged the Taiwan government to be more open-minded and actively engaged in policy-making in favor of promoting circular economy.

In addition to working with central and municipal governments, the Netherlands this year will send delegations to take part in InnoVEX and SEMICON events hosted in Taipei, as part of its efforts to seek potential partnerships with Taiwan in start-ups, smart city, and semi-conductor industries.

Speaking of the Holland Pavilion, Wittich said it is estimated that 1.4 million visitors have visited this first circular building in Taiwan, about 70 percent of the total visitors that have toured the Houli Forest Expo Site.

The Dutch representative office is planning to host a week-long event during the Lunar New Year’s holidays at the Holland Pavilion, where a new wave of visitors will be able to see the Netherlands’ national flower, tulip, blossoming in central Taiwan.

314,India should unlock the economic potential of waste recycling,"The rag picking urchins and the women from self help groups have so far been the beneficiaries of the waste recycling business in India, earning almost half the money that constitutes the value of the waste. Resource, is what people in the waste to wealth sector would like to call what goes out of the trash cans in homes, industrial units, organisaitons and public spaces.

But soon all that may change and the space, and all the wealth therein, may well be taken by the entrepreneurial class.



According to Sujeet Samaddar, Senior Consultant (Industry) in government think tank NITI Aayog, 3 million direct jobs, 12 to 15 million indirect jobs and Rs 700 million worth of materials could be unlocked in India by recycling waste. It may sound like music to the ears of Prime Minister Narendra Modi who will soon have to spell out what his government has done to create jobs.



The government think tank believes that there is plenty of opportunity for entrepreneurs as recycling had become a viable and sustainable business.



The NITI Aayog, in fact, will be coming out with its paper and policies on recycling waste in the second half of February. If we are to read between the lines of what Sammaddar said, the government may well declare recycling a part of industry within the infrastructure space.



While the whole recycling efforts on a large scale appears to be aimed at saving the earth, policy makers are also looking at it as a way to create jobs and unlock the value of waste. Studies in the field have discussed not only the solid waste management ecosystem, policy and regulatory framework, but also the business models and opportunities that will present themselves in the short term.



The expectation is that technology, including blockchain and artificial intelligence, will drive the recycling business, which may not need manual segregation. In fact, the government believes that the technology to handle mixed waste is already available in the form of plants that can convert any kind of waste—including construction and demolition debris—to wealth. If such plants are found less efficient, there are facilities to conduct research and improve them to suit India's unique needs.



Not only was there lots of headspace in the recycling business, enabling policies were also there in place, if the government is to be believed. And the buzz word is circular-economy, no landfills.



Waste paper basket is a misnomer to be taught to kids, it is resource basket. And landfills of today could be tourist spots and recreational areas, and even golf courses .



The participants at the national conference on “Managing Urban Waste: Solid waste, Plastic waste, Electronic waste"", organised by ASSOCHAM, were gungho as their contention that waste by itself was a resource found resonance in government. There was also expectation that what will follow are tax holidays and tax breaks, concessional rates of interest, capital depreciation etc.



Even as the speakers on the dais were oozing confidence and thought of a clean India, free of litter, was no more than two or three years away, those in the business did not seem to share the same spirit. As one of them put it, “We are moving there...but the journey is a very long one”.",India,2019.01
345,India's Cow Crisis Part 2: Threat of decline looms over livestock economy after 35 years’ growth,"The circular economy of cattle has ruptured, threatening livelihoods of India’s poorest. The value output of the livestock economy is Rs 9.18 lakh crore, managed mostly by small and marginal farmers

It is almost a year since Rahamdin Khan hasn’t got any good sleep. A resident of Khoabas, a bucolic village of 500 households at the foothills of Aravalli mountain range in Rajasthan’s Alwar district, Rahamdin witnessed a cruel turn in his fate some four years ago.

Except his traditional attire of white kurta and paijama, his life has undergone a change that he stutters to explain. A careful look around his home unmasks it. There are goats and buffalos but no more the cattle that once dictated the gross domestic product of his economy.

For centuries, villages like his in Rajasthan have eked out a fairly sustaining economy. In this part of the country, food crops are secondary economy.

In 2017, while he was on his way to a local cattle fare, a group of cow vigilantes thrashed Rahamdin and took away two milking cows along with calves. Bruised, battered and humiliated Rahamdin decided to abandon all his cattle. With that he withdrew from his primary livelihood.

“From the nurturers of a sound cattle economy, we are now looked at as enemies of the cow. Worse, we have been branded cow smugglers,” he says staring blankly at the floor.

The episode was followed by police raids. Many dairy farmers like Rahamdin were jailed after being charged with laws regulating cruelties against animals. “I was arrested twice between 2014 and 17,” he say sand hints that he had to cough up about Rs 40,000 to be free.

The lingering threat of violence made him quit cattle rearing in 2018. “A strange restlessness has gripped me since I discarded the 65 cattle I had,” he says.

“For us, it is a natural economy that singularly defined our prosperity. Can’t imagine prosperity without it,” says Rahamdin, who was once considered prosperous. Now he can be classified a farmer below the poverty line.

His consistent complain is he was left behind by “those” to fend off poverty and hunger. Residents know who “those” people are but never name them. “I don’t get sleep without cattle,” signs off Rahamdin.

Like him, the village’s other residents have started quitting cattle-rearing due to the rising threat of violence over cattle movement and stringent anti-cow trade laws that have been imposed in the state.

Cattle have simply vanished from the village’s landscape. At best, a few households keep some buffaloes or goats. It is like an economic plague taking its victims one at a time, eventually sweeping away everybody.

In Rajasthan, raids by cow vigilantes have been regular, often violent. The police registered 389 cases in 2017 alone under the Rajasthan Bovine Animal (Prohibition of Slaughter and Regulation of Temporary Migration or Export) Act, 1995. The state government amended this Act in 2015 to enable seizure of vehicle engaged in illegally carrying of cattle and arrest of smugglers. The numbers of cases was 474 in 2016 and 543 in 2015.

The state has witnessed lynchings by cow vigilantes over mere doubts of cow smuggling or slaughtering. In August 2018, the Supreme Court took note of a lynching in Alwar the previous month and directed the principal secretary of the state’s home department to furnish details of the action taken.

Not just Rajasthan; there has been a spike in cattle-related violence in recent years across northern India.

There have been 78 incidents of cow related violence in India since 2010, 50 of which were in northern states, Bhumi Adhikar Andolan reported. Interestingly, 97 per cent of the attacks were reported since 2014, according to the association of civil society groups across the country.

In these incidents, 29 persons were lynched. Most victims were those who have traditionally survived on the cattle/livestock-related economy. However, the Union government has denied in Parliament the existence of any such data as the states are supposed to do so.

As raids on cattle trade/movement become the new normal, villages are fast facing economic trouble and the cow is inching towards being a pariah breed. Khoabas village typifies this change.

Grazing lands there, limited to hilltops, have been fenced off for an Army project. Residents now take their cattle 10 kilometres away, along the national highway, in search of pasture. Most vigilante raids happen during such trips, making cattle-rearing virtually unsustainable as stall-feeding is prohibitively expensive due to ever-increasing fodder prices.

“I had to let go of 40 animals. I now have only two of them as a token,” says Khoabas resident Abadal Khan. Like Rahamdin he was once prosperous. He is now a daily wage labourer at a construction site in Alwar city. “Neither can I sell my cattle, nor can I keep them,” he says.

Like him, Baddan Khan has stopped rearing cattle, abandoned 50 cows, and is now a contractor for the public distribution scheme for foodgrain.

For Subba Khan of Sahuwas village, some 45 kilometres from Alwar city, the problem is of a different dimension. On October 3, 2017, the police allegedly colluded with cow vigilantes to seize 51 of his cattle grazing on the Aravalis and arrested his son Imran for “cow smuggling”. The Kishangarh Bas police station didn’t file any case, but left the cattle with the nearby Sri Krishna Gaushala—cow shelter.

“I pleaded with the caretaker of the gaushala to free the milking cows whose calves needed to be fed,” says Subba. “Neither the police nor the gaushala paid any heed. I bought five litres of milk to feed them, but in vain. After a week, 20 calves died of starvation,” he adds.

The shelter then demanded Rs 2 lakh from him for feeding the cattle, Subba alleges. It took a long trail through official corridors and a demand by some human rights activists and lawyers to finally get the cows released and an official certificate that he was not involved in smuggling.

“Eight cows died off within a week of that” says Subba. “I lost around Rs 3 lakh in the whole process. I have not overcome my loss,” says the farmer who once traded in around 300 litres of milk daily. Now the volume is a mere 30-40 litres.

Subba has shown exceptional courage in sticking to cattle-rearing. In his village, 25 households have withdrawn from the profession. Most of them have migrated to work on daily wages in Alwar, Jaipur or Delhi.

“I don’t know any other profession,” says Subba, whose elder brother is among those who has migrated.

Disruptions at the micro-level are gradually showing macro impacts. The volume of cattle traded has dropped up to 90 per cent at the various animal fairs in the state, official data shows.

At the popular Pushkar Mela, only 161 cattle were brought in 2017, of which a mere eight were sold, in 2017. In 2012, more than 4,000 cattle were brought and half of them were traded. At fairs across the state, only 500 cattle were sold in 2018 among 2,000 that were brought—a steep fall from 37,000 traded of 54,000 in 2012-13.

The cattle economy is a perfect example of the circular economy of the country’s poorest. Cows are called productive till they milk—from the age of three to 10. But they live up to 25-30 years, when they are economically unproductive.

Most owners then sell their cows. It can be assumed that the buyers slaughter them. The income from this is then ploughed back into buying new cattle, thus self-sustaining an economy that supports the poorest the most.

According to Kirit Parikh, a member of the erstwhile Planning Commission, the number of cows in the unproductive age is 1-3 per cent of total cows. Among male cows, those aged above 10 form just 2 per cent of the total male cow population. Male cattle are also sold by farmers.

A cow in its life time passes through at least four to five farming households, helping in improving the breed of cattle.

This explains how farmers strike a balance between productive and non-productive cattle. The livestock sector is bigger than the crop sector, though both are clubbed together as the agriculture sector.

“Livestock is the best insurance against agrarian distress as the sector is the source of sustained income and generates income more frequently than the crop sector,” said the government-appointed Committee On Doubling Farmers’ Income. In fact this committee pointed out that for the last 35 years, the livestock sub-sector under agriculture never reported negative growth.

Now, there is a puncture in this circular economy.

Many milk collectors from villages in Alwar and nearby districts vouch for a dip in milk production. Sahabuddin, a milk collector of Ghajaud village, now just earns half of what he used to in the last two years.

“I employed five persons to collect around 800 liters of milk every day from five villages three years ago. Now, the volume is a quarter of that,” says Sahabuddin. Hesitantly, he offers the reason: “People now have fewer cows.” Now, it’s only him, collecting milk, a profession practiced by 5-10 in every village just three years ago, villagers say.

It could be a scary warning for India’s dairy industry, pegged at Rs 5.5 lakh crore in 2015, engaging 73 million small and marginal dairy farmers.

“The government should understand fast and step back from regressive laws that hamper dairy growth,” says RS Khanna, chairman of Kwality Limited, a Delhi-based dairy company.

According to the government’s own documents, livestock drives agricultural growth: the share of livestock has gradually risen and that of crops declined among the gross value added to agriculture.

The Economic Survey of India 2018 report shows that share of crops declined to 60 per cent in 2015-16 from 65 per cent in 2011-12. In the same period, the share of livestock increased from 22 per cent to 26 per cent.

A Central Statistics Office report pegs livestock value output at Rs 917,910 crore at current prices in 2016-17. Two-thirds of that value—Rs 614,387 crore—is of milk, only a tad below the value of foodgrain (cereals and pulses) of Rs 652,787 crore. In fact, in 2014-15, the output value of milk surpassed the value of foodgrain.

The livestock economy is at a crossroads. Its nature started shifting from “agriculture and transportation” to “milk yield” after farms became increasingly mechanised in the early 1970s. In the past four decades, machines have eliminated draught breeds from fields. The National Sample Survey Office data reveals that the number of livestock in rural areas has reduced by 18 per cent – from 169 million to 135 million (1971-2012).

With the concept of intensive farming, with help from machines, draught cattle became unproductive and useless, and the focus shifted to high-yielding cow breeds. During 2007-2012, the number of milch breeds increased by over 28 per cent.

But now there is a growing threat to this sector as well.

351,Rising circular debt can devastate economy: PEW,"The Pakistan Economy Watch (PEW) on Sunday said circular debt is quietly rising to an extent that it has become a threat which can devastate the economy.

The infamous debt has marched across Rs1400 billion but a serious effort to tackle the issue is yet to be seen, it said.

The issue of circular debt should be resolved on war-footing lest it becomes a tsunami for the troubled economy, said Dr Murtaza Mughal, President PEW.

He said that the circular debt was Rs922 billion in November which has now climbed to over Rsw1400 billion while the reason behind fast escalation cannot be ascertained at the government level.

Dr Murtaza Mughal said that concerned authorities are not interested in containing power theft, reducing losses and improving recoveries but they prefer to hide the facts from the government despite knowing the threat it poses to the economy.

The government should develop a foolproof system for monitoring the debt, determine its reasons and take steps to overcome it.

Those who think that burdening masses is the only way out are wrong as it is increasing poverty and hitting industrial and agricultural production while making exports uncompetitive in the international market.

It may be noted that this debt arises out of high electricity losses and inability of power companies to recover all the bills which leave power sector unable to discharge obligations towards fuel suppliers and banks.",Pakistan,2019.01

376,All the tools for tackling climate issue are at hand,"Climate change is the defining global challenge of our time. It is real, and it is happening now.

The past three years have been the warmest on record-one of many signs of climate change, which poses exceptional challenges on a global scale. More worrisome, climate change is running faster than our actions to stop the current global warming trajectory of 3 C.

The recent Special Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that natural disasters will increase in frequency and severity, including floods and storms, with resulting declines in food security and prosperity.

Competition over scarce resources-such as water-could lead to more conflicts. Around the world, we can already see how devastating such situations can be.

For example, on a recent visit to Nigeria, my home country, I saw firsthand the impact that climate change and environmental mismanagement can have. Lake Chad, the beating heart of life in the region I grew up in, has shrunk by more than 90 percent since the 1960s, leading to increased competition over scarce resources. As a result, the economy has suffered, leading to massive declines in livelihoods. This has, in turn, helped create a fertile ground for extremist groups such as Boko Haram.

The violence caused by such conflicts hits the most vulnerable the hardest. Communities in the region have had to deal with political, economic and environmental challenges for years. Without accelerated climate action, we will see increases in the number and intensity of such conflicts.

This brings us to another point, which is that we will need innovative solutions for climate action at all levels-in universities, homes, cities and businesses.

The good news is that we are not starting from scratch. We have all the mechanisms we need to tackle climate change.

Nations of the world pledged to collectively address climate change in the early 1990s through the establishment of the UN Framework Convention on Climate

Change and, most recently, through the signing of the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Goals 13 to 15.

By signing the Climate Convention and the Paris Agreement, nations of the world committed to lowering their emissions and creating a more sustainable and resilient future through Nationally Determined Contributions.

The potential of the Paris Agreement, however, has yet to be fully unleashed by implementing the NDCs.

Based on the emissions reductions that countries have pledged so far, we are still on a trajectory to reach at least 3 C of global warming. And that would lead to nothing less than global destabilization, with disastrous and irreversible consequences.

China is not exempt from the impacts of climate change.

Rising sea levels are already threatening coastlines in China, for example in cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangzhou. If sea levels rise by 1 meter, more than 92,000 square kilometers of China's coast could be flooded. This could potentially displace 67 million people. Almost two-thirds of the ice in Asia's glaciers could vanish if average global temperatures rise beyond 1.5 C by the end of the century.

The good news is that countries such as China are clearly on board for strong leadership. For example, within the past five years, China has deployed more solar and wind capacity than any other country in the world. It is-also the largest clean energy investor in the world-spending some $130 billion on renewable energy in recent years.

The development of electric vehicles is particularly inspiring in China. More than 50 percent of electric vehicles in the world are sold in the country. China is also supporting infrastructure development in other countries. This offers the opportunity to leapfrog outdated technologies and ensure that newly built infrastructure is sustainable in the long term.

China has also pioneered an increasingly prominent policy through promoting a model of the circular economy, going beyond the current linear pattern of take-make-dispose.

In conclusion, there is no more urgent time to solve climate change, and we have all the tools we need to create a new reality. In particular, I call on all young people to take a stand and advocate for more ambitious climate action and sustainable living. Let us join hands and use this as an opportunity to strive for a healthy, prosperous and sustainable future for all.",China,2019.01
384,Why doesn't Nespresso close the loop on aluminium?,"Nestlé-owned coffee giant Nespresso, famed for its single-serve, disposable coffee capsules and commercials starring George Clooney, signed a deal in November with metal mining company Rio Tinto to use “responsibly sourced” aluminium.

Both companies joined forces to make all of Nespresso’s aluminium coffee capsules greener by 2020, by manufacturing them with only 100 per cent sustainable aluminium that has been given the ethical seal of approval by the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI).

Daniel Weston, general counsel and head of Nespresso’s creating shared value group, called this the world’s first responsible aluminium deal.

The iconic disposable capsules will be made from ASI-certified aluminium that has passed independent third-party auditing, covering a range of criteria including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, minimisation of waste effluents, protection of biodiversity, and the upholding of workers’ labour rights.

“For Nespresso, recycling wasn’t enough—it was also important to look at how aluminium was produced in the first place,” said Rio Tinto in a statement.

But Nespresso’s aluminium initiative raises the question: why is the company using mined aluminium to produce coffee capsules when 100 per cent recycled aluminium is the truly sustainable option?

Aluminium is one of the most environmentally-friendly packaging materials—the lightweight metal can be recycled an infinite number of times without any loss of quality; three-quarters of all aluminium ever smelted remains in use. The ease and profitability of recycling aluminium is so great—aluminium can scrap is worth US$1,186 per ton—that the aluminium recycling industry is expected to hit a market size of around US$434 billion by 2023.

Furthermore, the environmental toll of recycled aluminium is only a fraction of producing new aluminium—the former consumes 92 per cent less energy and belches 95 per cent less carbon emissions than the latter.

While recycling aluminium should be the logical—and greener—step forward for Nespresso, coffee capsules are notoriously hard to recycle.

Made of a mixture of plastic and other materials, coffee pods are so small that most recycling facilities are unable to process them. Most end up in landfills, where they take 150–500 years to break down.

While Nespresso runs a global recycling programme in 44 countries for its coffee capsules, customers in Singapore can only drop them off at limited collection points, or with the courier who delivers their next order of coffee.

In response to an enquiry from Eco-Business, Nespresso claimed that one in four of their capsules are recycled globally. Its website also indicates that their coffee capsules are “infinitely recyclable”.

However, Nespresso said that only 13 per cent of its Vertuo range capsules were made using recycled aluminium. Despite enquiries, the company failed to mention whether the other two ranges of capsules, Original and Nespresso Professional Range, use recycled aluminium too.

When asked why the firm is not using recycled aluminium to manufacture their capsules, Nespresso claimed their capsules require a “specific alloy of aluminium”—alloy 8011 that is not found in recycled aluminium and one of the only sources are recycled Nespresso capsules.

But Professor Seeram Ramakrishna, chair of the Circular Economy Taskforce at the National University of Singapore, disagrees that the alloy is not as rare as Nespresso claims. Aluminium alloy 8011 is a “malleable wrought alloy”, which can be “supplied by other companies too”, he said.

“It is a hard-nosed business decision,” said Ramakrishna on Nespresso’s decision to choose mined aluminium over recycled aluminium. He elaborated that it takes much effort on the part of companies to adopt a business model fully in line with the circular economy, which is where all materials used in production are reused or restored to decrease the need for virgin material.

Choosing responsibly sourced aluminium might be easier for Nespresso than using 100 per cent recycled aluminium. “For circular model paths, Nespresso needs to partner with other companies along the whole supply and value chain, [all of which] require more resources and different skillsets,” he said.

Although more companies are starting to adopt the circular economy approach—sportswear giant Adidas recycled ocean plastics to manufacture shoes, and tech company Dell harvests gold from the motherboards of end-of-life Dell computers to create a new line of jewellery—the circular economy model should not be confused with increased recycling.

“A fully circular model means zero waste generation over the entire life cycle of the products while embracing renewable energies for all intermediary steps in the entire supply chain,” said Ramakrishna. “Increased recycling is only a simplified partial solution when compared to the circular model.”",Singapore,2019.01
459,New recycling plan taps energy fund,"The government has agreed to use the remaining cash from the Energy Conservation Fund to support a new recycling plan for discarded solar panels and vehicle batteries, in line with the goal of creating a circular economy.

The Industry, Energy and Transport ministries will host the project after officials met last Thursday.

""Thailand is encouraging people and companies to use renewable power and drive electric vehicles, but it has yet to plan for a retreatment and management programme for this kind of industrial waste,"" said Pasu Loharjun, permanent secretary of the Industry Ministry.

He said the three ministries agreed to cooperate to begin the plan soon.

""We are collecting related data to draw up the retreatment and management plan, while the 2-billion-baht fund will finance the project,"" he said.

Mr Pasu declined to go into detail about the budget for spending from the fund.

""Currently, Thailand generates roughly 30 million tonnes of general and hazardous waste per year,"" he said. ""Some 3 million tonnes of this volume is hazardous waste that could be managed by landfill facilities, so the government aims to turn these landfill locations into energy resources.""

Mr Pasu said senior officials from the three ministries also talked about the 20-year National Strategy and expressed interest in promoting electric vehicles, energy storage systems and a national power grid to rapidly mobilise the country's energy and industrial sectors.

With the promotion of such schemes, they predict many tonnes of waste from solar panels and vehicle batteries in the near future.

Moreover, Mr Pasu said the government will accelerate the fourth phase of the national petrochemical development plan after the third one started in 2004 and ended in 2018.

Map Ta Phut in Rayong has been developed as the premier petrochemical cluster for Thailand and a global petrochemical hub for the past several decades.

""The petrochemical cluster has been put on the list of targeted industries and located in the flagship Eastern Economic Corridor,"" Mr Pasu said. ""There are many related petrochemical facilities in Rayong, such as the liquefied natural gas (LNG) receiving terminal with a capacity of 10 million tonnes a year.""

In addition, the Industry Ministry has asked the Energy Ministry to coordinate data from its energy information technology centre as it aims to monitor the power consumption of manufacturing plants nationwide.",Thailand,2019.02
473,Investors encouraged to enter scrap vehicle sector,"Private and foreign investors are being encouraged to enter the scrap motor vehicle business to fuel competition in China's huge market, officials at the Ministry of Commerce said on Friday.

The newly amended rules on the recycling of junk vehicles, approved by the State Council last month, remove barriers to private and foreign capital, Vice-Minister of Commerce Wang Bingnan said at a news conference of the State Council Information Office.

""In practice, the number of recycling enterprises was strictly controlled, with some areas having only one, which created a monopoly and restricted private capital,"" Wang said, noting that the new rules eliminate the limits.

China had around 327 million motor vehicles at the end of last year, including 240 million automobiles, according to the traffic management bureau of the Ministry of Public Security.

Zheng Shuwei, director of the Department of Market System Development at the Ministry of Commerce, said at the news conference that the vehicle scrapping rate is 4 to 6 percent of the total number of vehicles annually.

""This means we have a vast market for the recycling of scrapped motor vehicles,"" Zheng said, adding that recycling will also help enhance the market for new and secondhand vehicles and improve the auto sector overall.

The amendment to the rules also removes provisions that require the five major components of a motor vehicle－engine, steering system, transmission, axles and chassis, or frame－to be melted down.

Instead, it encourages them to be remanufactured, thereby improving the vehicle's salvage value. Wang said that as part of the nation's development of a circular economy, scrap vehicles can be sold to remanufacturing companies.

Meanwhile, recycling enterprises must comply with the environmental protection standards regarding storage, equipment and norms for dismantling to ensure green development, he said.",China,2019.02

488,When the circular economy meets aviation,"About 400 to 600 commercial aircraft are retired and disassembled each year now, creating mountains of waste that include about 30,000 tonnes of aluminium, 1,800 tonnes of alloys, 1,000 tonnes of carbon fibre and 600 tonnes of other materials.

To make matters worse, with the sharp increase in air travel in the past few decades, as many as 18,000 planes could reach the end of their service life in the 14 years between 2017 and 2030, according to the International Civil Aviation Organisation.

Faced with the spectre of growing waste volumes, and with cost considerations in mind, aerospace companies and governments have developed ways to use fewer raw materials in manufacturing aircraft, and to replace them with recycled materials instead.

In 2014, American aerospace firm Boeing started to recycle about 22 million pounds of scrap aluminium from its factories annually, turning it into aircraft parts. In 2016, a coalition of European and Chinese companies, universities and research institutions, funded by their governments, started a three-year joint project to create renewable biomaterials that can be used to make airplane components.

Pratt & Whitney (P&W), an American aerospace manufacturer with global service operations, has set out a list of sustainability goals to be achieved by 2020. These include reducing greenhouse gas emissions from its operations by 15 per cent and increasing its total recycling rate to 90 per cent. It has introduced several major programmes to help it to fulfil these goals.

To cut its use of raw materials and generate less waste, the company uses innovative “near-net-shape” forging technologies. These produce parts that are closer in size and shape to the desired end products, so that fewer materials are needed to make them. The forgings also require less cutting and shaping, thus creating less waste.

“We had to create forging presses that have a higher degree of accuracy and give us more control over the manufacturing process, but it was worth it. By using near-net-shape forging, we have reduced our raw material use for some components by more than 25 per cent,” said Shaun Mace, engineering discipline chief of P&W’s Forging Centre of Excellence.

With greater control over the forging process, the company has also been able to design and use new and stronger alloys, enabling it to make certain parts smaller without losing any capabilities. It developed nickel-based alloys, for instance, that are now used for engine components such as turbine disks, compressor rotors and airfoils.

“With the conventional forging process, there is also a limit to the amount of recycled material you can use. As you keep recycling materials, over time, their alloys will change, until eventually you cannot use them in the conventional forging process. Since the near-net-shape forging process is more accurate and controllable, we can use more of the changed recycled materials,” said Mace.

P&W also has a Revert Management Programme to reuse scraps from its manufacturing process and engine overhauls and repairs.

Over the years, P&W has developed special alloys for some of its parts, including proprietary materials that are used for engine parts that need to withstand exceptionally high temperatures and stresses.

The company is working with suppliers around the world to ensure that they have practices in place to not only minimise the volume of scrap materials generated, wherever possible, but also maximise the amount that can be recycled.

P&W has also developed additional special alloy processes for the Revert programme that will enable it to recover an additional 500,000 to 700,000 pounds of material each year.

“Recycling is not just good for the environment but it also helps us to save money. The more successful we are at generating clean revert material, the fewer raw materials we need to purchase, and it is worth noting that it requires less energy to recycle alloys than to create alloys from raw materials.” said Peter Tibbetts, head of the Revert programme.

“As we continue to transform aviation and achieve a greener footprint with our products and services, we are also committed to minimising our impact on the environment in our global facilities, and among our suppliers,” said Lisa Szewczul, vice president of environment, health and safety at P&W. “This attention to total lifecycle cost is key as we continue to pursue aggressive sustainability goals while increasing business value.”",Singapore,2019.02
551,"Disposing of things that don’t spark a joy, responsibly","HYDERABAD: When you think about all the waste we keep producing year after year so much plastic all around, empty bottles, broken mobile chargers, old unused computers, newspapers/magazines etc, we get very concerned about where all this can be permanently disposed. We are living in days where technology is evolving rapidly; consumerism is at its peak and so the waste we generate also is increasing day by day with these advancing times.

Almost every other industry in the market is adopting new and advanced technologies. The recycling industry is now gearing up to adopt latest technology to help the environment and also the people who work in the industry. To facilitate this development of making the recycling process easier as well as lucrative, Hyderabad-based Rapi due Technologies launched Recykal, a web and mobile platform, supposedly India’s first cloud-based technology start-up in this space.

44Recykal calls itself a full-service waste and recycle-enabling company, focuses on buying and selling the recyclables connecting the customers, businesses, manufacturers, and waste collectors to a network of recyclers, who face a shortage of reliable supply in the industry. In short, the app connects generators, processors & recyclers with each other. While Recykal is tailor-made for the industry and the government, Uzed, is an add on app that caters to the individuals and the residential users.

Abhishek Deshpande, Co-founder of Recykal, says, “We might be a three-year-old start-up in this industry but the amount of expertise, mentorship and network we have with us, we are sure to expand rapidly in the next few years. Before launching the app, the team physically visited the field, took stock and tried to understand the pain points. There are a lot of good intentions coming up in the country in terms of waste and recycle management, but people do not have any access to the technology that provides them a better alternative of the current state. Recykal, will help companies have better transparency and traceability of their waste and households will be able to dispose of their waste responsibly and strive towards a clean and green India”.

With the vision to accelerate India’s transition to a circular economy, Recykal says it is working towards changing the informal and disjointed recycling industry and building a formal recycling system in place for wastes like plastic, paper, e-waste, metal, glass, textile etc.

Recykal influences a large number of waste pickers across the country by empowering them to have a better livelihood, providing better incomes and access to various incentive programs that would potentially benefit their living standards.

“With Recykal and Uzed, we want to help the recycling industry, the people working in the sector, educate the common man to use technology and recycle the waste they generate and also create new opportunities on how waste can be used as a resource”, informs Deshpande.

The company gives complete end to end tracking and clarity to corporates, hotels, malls and even housing societies and helps them make money out of waste by selling the recyclables easily. It also provides people with access to the recycle market place, for supply visibility, better quality, and competitive pricing. Recykal’s client list includes Aditya Birla Group, Accor Hotels, Westside, Big Basket, Maruti Suzuki, Honda , Spar Supermarket and Banyan Nation etc to name a few. Recykal is headquartered in Hyderabad and has operations in Mumbai and Pune. The services have begun in all the 3 cities.

Recykal is the hero we all need. It is innovative, eco-friendly, transparent and is easy to use. The next time you go clueless as to what should you do with all the waste produced in your office remember Recykal. It’s just an “install” away.",India,2019.02
565,How can the circular economy make infrastructure more sustainable?,"Infrastructure provides all the vital services to keep an urban area functioning, from transport and energy to utilities and waste disposal. Sustainable or not, our need for infrastructure is growing.

This is for two main reasons: we have a growing global population, which means a higher demand for infrastructure and, on top of that, a large proportion of this population is being born into or migrating into cities. Currently, over 50 per cent of the global population live in cities and that figure is set to rise to 60 per cent by 2030.

According to the Asian Development Bank, Asia-Pacific alone requires an investment of $1.7 trillion a year over the next decade in order to keep up with economic growth and tackle poverty and climate change. Investment in infrastructure projects across Indonesia, in particular, has risen rapidly to respond to an economy that is set to expand by 5.3 per cent this year and the next.

This will lead to the consumption of vast amounts of virgin materials and has the potential to further exacerbate climate change if unmanaged. And it is not just in Asia Pacific, other parts of the world are urbanising too. Surely we need some seriously strong incentives and regulation to make sure that we build sustainably?

A journey of learning but… how long have we got?

Policy and industry attitudes are changing, but is this change happening fast enough to mitigate the effects of climate change? In my opinion, public procurement strategies should be setting targets which are far more challenging to the construction industry, particularly on the environmental impact of the materials used and the finished asset.

But we are going to need a lot more than political will to mitigate pollution and improve efficiency in the construction industry. We will need further research and development into areas such as digitalisation, electromobility, virtual reality, 3D printing, new materials, the redesign of existing products, and the subsequent trialing of these innovations. This will require new types of collaboration and business models.

Sectors such as energy are already investing heavily in R&D, for example in battery storage, and consequently advancements in efficiency and decarbonisation. As this sector and others advance, the need for the construction industry to make changes becomes ever pressing. But in an industry that is so risk-averse, how can innovation and collaboration be promoted and invested in?

One movement that aims to support collaboration between researchers, key industry players, and environmental specialists is the Construction Climate Challenge initiative hosted by Volvo CE. These different groups come together to share knowledge, costs, risks – and ultimately the benefits – of working collaboratively to develop new ways to cut carbon in the construction and procurement industry. Presenting their experience demonstrating efficiency and associated cost savings helps advance new ways of working within the construction industry.

The benefit of going round in circles

The definition of sustainable development is the process of maintaining a balanced environment that meets life’s needs now and, in the future. The sustainable element of infrastructure is not just in the upfront design, construction methods and use of materials in the asset, but also its operation, maintenance, and disposal—this is the basis of a circular economy.

A circular economy is an economic system aimed at minimising waste and making the most of resources. So, when designing and building infrastructure the whole lifecycle needs to be considered. We can then focus far more holistically on how to make the asset more sustainable – be that design for deconstruction or complete recyclability.

And the value of understanding the life cycle of materials is being widely recognised by industry and policy. The European Union has estimated that by extracting maximum value and use of raw materials – through waste prevention, eco-design, and reuse – EU businesses could save €600 billion while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by up to 4 per cent.

We’re increasingly seeing more understanding of product responsibility and this has been reflected in a number of policies and product standards particularly in the EU. The EU’s Circular Economy Package’s (CEP) revised text states that improving the efficiency of resource use and ensuring that waste is valued as a resource can contribute to reducing the dependence on the import of raw materials and facilitate the transition to more sustainable material management and to a circular economy model.

Once we’ve identified all the steps in producing, using and decommissioning our infrastructure we have to go about making these steps not only sustainable but affordable. This will require investment to build capacity to execute these steps, which will, in turn, lead to the added benefits of upskilling the industry and creating jobs to support this new infrastructure.

Procurement strategies, also known as balanced scorecards, help identify the best possible design to maximise the social economic and environmental performance of a whole project, and this is absolutely key. But these strategies need to be more ambitious to further stimulate innovation.

Paving the way for sustainable infrastructure

One project that has come a long way in this regard is the Stockholm Metro Extension project. The project comprises of 20km of new track and 11 new train stations. To aid the design process a template station was developed as a model for all the stations. To reduce the carbon footprint of the stations, the project team first calculated the cost and the carbon footprint for the template station (Figure 1). Concrete and steel were the main contributors to the carbon footprint.

They then identified measures for reducing material use and redesigning the station. The biggest carbon cuts came from the reduction of steel and the incorporation of recycled steel and other materials.

The final step was to follow up the results and make a new carbon calculation to reduce the carbon even further for the second version of the template station (Figure 2). By following this process, not only was carbon reduced by 40 per cent, but costs were reduced by as much as 30 per cent, as well as the physical amount of construction materials used.

There is a long way to go but one thing is clear, conventional construction methods and processes with existing materials are not the future. Ultimately, we need to redesign products, infrastructure and policy in an integrated way so that we maximise the benefits if we are to build a better tomorrow.

622,Ikea mulls greener strategy,"Consumers can learn a lesson from the way companies often lease equipment and goods, paying by usage rather than for objects themselves.

THE most circular thing about Ikea, the Swedish furniture retailer, has traditionally been the path that it makes customers follow through its superstores to find the goods they have driven there to buy. As they wander along its displays, Ikea wants them to spot other decorations and take them home too.

The ""circular economy"" now means something else: the reuse and repurposing of products in different ways. Ikea has just disclosed that it not only wants to recycle more furniture, but plans a trial in Switzerland this year to lease desks, chairs and perhaps kitchens. Instead of acquiring furniture cheaply and later throwing it away, customers might lease it for a while and then upgrade, with the old pieces being refurbished for other users.

No one buys Ikea furniture to pass on to the next generation - it is rarely moved from the spot where it is put together. That is not the point - like fast fashion clothing and other goods made in China, it has been cheap enough to treat as disposable rather than as an heirloom. But even Ikea shows signs of doubting whether this approach can endure.

""We don't want people to be attracted by old things. We want them to like the new ones,"" says Mustapha Mond, a controller of the dystopian society in Aldous Huxley's 1932 novel, Brave New World. The attitude also applies to companies that make consumer goods - the more sales, the better. To escape our own dystopia, it needs to change.

The velocity of consumption has steadily risen, partly because companies such as Ikea make buying stuff easy. Sofa and televisions were once hefty household investments but can be bought cheaply now. About 100 billion garments are made each year - 14 for each person - and they are kept for only half as long as 15 years ago, the consultancy McKinsey & Co estimates.

This causes a lot of damage. Each person in the world draws about 10 tonnes of raw materials from metals to biomass annually into the economy to support consumption and production, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which advocates a circular economy. Much of it will end up as waste, given how hard it is to reuse - only 14 per cent of plastic packaging is taken for recycling, and far less actually recycled.

Few companies would stay in business if they only made goods that lasted a lifetime. But plenty can do more to limit repetitive consumption. They have selfish motives to try, as Ikea and others are doing: young consumers enjoy buying things but many are environmentally conscious (at least in theory) and are repelled by waste.

Companies can start with packaging, too much of which is made from complex plastics that ends up in landfill or the world's oceans. Reusing a tiny sachet with a pullback plastic lid is very tricky, and recycling in general is more expensive following China's crackdown on imports of waste last year.

More containers should be refillable, like the glass bottles brought to my door by our milkman, and SodaStream's carbon dioxide gas canisters for bubbly water. Packaged goods groups including Nestlé and Procter & Gamble plan to experiment this year in London, Paris and the US with refillable brand packaging through a startup called Loop.

Packaging is only one of the excesses in the way that products are marketed and consumed. Not only are things bought and disposed of rapidly, but many are used sparingly while their owners have them - in Europe, the average car is parked 92 per cent of the time and 31 per cent of food is wasted, McKinsey estimates.

Consumers can learn a lesson from the way companies often lease equipment and goods, paying by usage rather than for objects themselves. That applies to photocopiers made by Kyocera and Xerox, while the flooring company Desso leases office carpets - cleaning as well as fitting.

More things could be rented by individuals, as technology has encouraged. The Internet makes it easier to share occupancy of cars and apartments through Uber and Airbnb, and people subscribe to music and other digital services rather than buying discs.

People lease cars for three or four years and there is no reason why more durable goods, including furniture, cannot be rented. Not only does it limit waste but it gives companies an incentive to make things sturdily - better materials would require fewer repairs.

The circular economy has pitfalls, notably the so-called rebound effect: the easier it is to use products, the more intensively this will happen. That is not a problem for furniture, but sharing cars can exacerbate congestion and pollution rather than curbing it.

But the reuse and refurbishment of goods has enormous benefits compared with things being sold once, used for a time and then dumped. At best, recycling involves breaking things into raw materials and, in effect, discarding all the investment and labour that went into their making and marketing.

If Ikea aspires to become circular, there is no reason why others should not follow. It will be difficult to reform the consumption habits of the past few decades but all of us - consumers and companies - can try. FT",Singapore,2019.02
704,Union Minister Suresh Prabhu to inaugurate MRAI conference on Sunday,"KOCHI: Union Minister Suresh Prabhu will inaugurate the sixth national conference of Material Recycling Association of India (MRAI) at Hotel Grand Hyatt at 10 am on Sunday. As many as 1,400 delegates including 350 representatives from 40 countries will attend the two-day conference, Association president Sanjay Mehta told a press conference here on Saturday.

The conference will bring together representatives from the metal, plastic, paper, e-waste recycling industry and government officers from key ministries apart from international bodies, importers and machinery manufacturers providing a platform to deliberate and chart the road-map for the recycling industry, he said.

The theme of the conference is the role of recycling policy in India’s circular economy. The conference will dwell upon the need for better recycling practices and the impact of the upcoming policy, said vice president Dhawal Shah.

Material recycling expert and a former consultant of the Niti Aayog, Sujeet Samaddar said the Union Government is expected to role out the national Material Recycling policy soon. The suggestions have been compiled and the policy has been sent for inter-ministerial consultation, he said.

The policy has six thrust areas which include ensuring minimum wages to the rag pickers, improving the recycling of products from 30 percent to 60 per cent, converting the linear economy to circular economy, Addressing the environmental concerns and conserving energy, creating awareness about reducing pollution and recycling products and directly contribute to the economy by creating a culture of recycling. The policy aims to increase the share of recycled products to 70 per cent in 10 years.

705,Circular debt,"The energy sector will make or break Pakistan’s economy. And circular debt will make or break Pakistan’s energy sector. In August 2018, when the new government was formed, the accumulated stock of circular debt stood at Rs1.14 trillion. Red alert: By January 2019, the same had swollen to Rs1.4 trillion – an increase of Rs260 billion in 137 days or Rs1,897 million a day every day. Imagine: Rs1.4 trillion is $10 billion – compare that to $3 billion that we recently borrowed from Saudi Arabia.

Reforming the energy sector will make or break Pakistan’s energy sector. Yes, reforming the energy sector will make or break Pakistan’s economy. Yes, Pakistan’s economy will make or break 208 million Pakistanis. To be certain, reforming the energy sector will result in potential losers and potential gainers. The potential losers will be independent power producers (IPPs) and the potential gainers will be 208 million Pakistanis.

Red alert: As long as the potential losers are also the so-called ‘reformers’ Pakistan’s energy sector will not be reformed. Once again, Pakistan’s energy sector will not be reformed for as long as the potential losers are also the so-called ‘reformers’. In essence, the game is all about 30 IPPs versus 208 million Pakistanis. Let’s see who wins.

The ground reality is that 30 IPPs are holding Pakistan’s economy hostage. Yes, 30 IPPs are holding 208 million Pakistanis hostage. According to Shahid Sattar, a noted expert in the field, “the energy tariffs in Pakistan are now one of the most expensive in the world”.

In Pakistan, the solar-based “first 10-year tariff rates are from 18 to 19 cents/kWh”. In India, the “solar tariff is between 7-8 cents”. In Pakistan, “wind-power projects have been given Rs15.322/kWh levelised… current worldwide wind power tariffs are as low as 2.6 cents/kWh; world average tariffs are around 6-7 cents/kWh”.

Port Qasim and Sahiwal coal-fired power plants are “getting a tariff of 8.36 cents/kWh and 9.16 cents/kWh, respectively.” India’s Mundra Ultra Power Coal Project “is far cheaper than Pakistani plants on a tariff rate of Indian Rs2.64/kWh”. According to Shahid Sattar, “over-payments to these two projects are estimated to be $475 million per annum and over the life of the plants will be more than $14.25 billion.”

Once again, the energy sector will make or break Pakistan’s economy. And, Pakistan’s economy will make or break 208 million Pakistanis – that’s how important energy-sector reforms really are. As of today, there is “over-capacity in power [and] exorbitant tariff rates which render energy unaffordable”.

The Energy Task Force is into its fifth month during which the circular debt has gone up by a hefty Rs260 billion. Any reforms in sight? Pricing reforms? Governance reforms? System efficiency?

The one thing that will make or break the PTI government’s economic policy is circular debt. I must repeat: Pakistan’s energy sector will not be reformed for as long as the potential losers of the reform effort are also the so-called ‘reformers’. Once again, the game is all about 30 IPPs versus 208 million Pakistanis. Red alert: The 30 IPPs are organised, 208 million Pakistanis are not. Let’s see who wins.

The global call for submissions will close on 5 April 2019, 11:59pm (GMT+8) Singapore time.

The need for transformative action has never been greater. Humanity only has 12 years to curb its carbon emissions and keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius—or risk an irreversible climate crisis, according to the recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

It’s not game over yet. But beating the 12-year climate deadline and providing better lives for Asia’s growing urban populations will take a drastic reduction in our energy footprint and moving to a circular economy. That’s why The Liveability Challenge aims to close the financing gap between the ideas needed for liveable cities of the future, and the investments that will make these solutions a reality.

The Challenge is presented by Temasek Foundation Ecosperity and organised by Eco-Business, in partnership with Ecosperity Week 2019. A total of 28 partners from business, civil society and government are supporting The Liveability Challenge, almost double the number from 2018.

“To give the world a fighting chance at preventing runaway climate change, humanity must slash emissions by 45 per cent and it is clear that incremental improvements will not be enough. But we believe in the power of human ingenuity and determination, which is why this year’s Challenge aims to tackle two major areas of concern in sustainability—energy and circular economy,” said Ms Jessica Cheam, Managing Editor of Eco-Business.

“With more funding and support this year, the Challenge aims to drive impact and ensure a sustainable future for urban residents in the tropical belt, who are among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change in the decades to come,” she added.

The launch event at Cool Cats, The NCO Club at South Beach marked the start of The Liveability Challenge 2019’s call for submissions related to clean energy or the circular economy. Proposals submitted must have proof of concept or have achieved Technology Readiness Level 6. Submissions close 5 April 2019, and must be done via the official website of The Liveability Challenge (www.theliveabilitychallenge.org).

Shortlisted finalists will get to pitch their projects to a panel of Asia’s most sought-after venture capitalists and investors during Ecosperity Week in June.

882,Focus on circular economy for job creation and climate change goals,"The Global Recycling Day, which falls on March 18, has a crucial significance for a country like India, which has to achieve massive economic growth by balancing the dual objectives of job creation and its international commitment to the Paris Climate Goals and SDGs (sustainable development goals).

In such a scenario a transition is imminent, a kind of paradigm shift that is focused on fostering economic growth, through circular economy, banking on the so called 6R principles of 'reduce-recover-reuse-recycle-redesign-remanufacture'.

India's rapid economic growth, has created a larger consumer base with a growing demand for materials. As India embarks on even higher trajectories of growth, its resource requirements is set to increase. Estimates suggest that annual material consumption in India will likely triple by 2030, compared to 4.83 billion MT in 2009. Enhanced material recycling could help India decouple its growth story from primary resource and material consumption.

If one thinks of long term growth a circular economy path to development is something we should consider as it could bring India economic benefits of around Rs 40 lakh crore in 2050 compared to the so called business-as-usual development path – a benefit equivalent to 30 per cent of India's current GDP.

Take job creation for instance. The more labour intensive recycling value chain can generate six to eight times more jobs than by incineration or land filling of wastes –Examples of this can be cited from the United States scrap industry which generated over 150,000 direct jobs and 323,000 indirect jobs in 2015 (ISRI); and China where recycling industry created 1.5 million direct jobs and about 10 million indirect jobs.

In India, the metal recycling sector presently employs almost 1.75 million people, contributing 2% of the GDP. Studies reveal that material recycling in all probability can create six times more jobs in 2030. This calls for designating recycling as a ‘strategic sector’ under the Make in India programme in view of the sector’s huge environmental footprint, tremendous job creation potential and, its prospects of adopting high-end process and technologies.

However, recycling rates in India are languishing for a variety of factors, making the country the third largest importer of various types of scrap material.

Although presently there is an over-supply of scrap metal in South-East Asia, imposition of import duty on metal scraps is a deterrent for recyclers to import. In recent years, there has been a rising cost of imports from Free Trade Agreement (FTA) countries too since suppliers increase their product pricing in order to keep parity with the duty added price of scrap from non-FTA countries.

To mitigate such risks, there is an inherent need to ensure a steady supply of domestic scrap conforming to appropriate quality standards. Government should also look at incentivising R&D and innovation in the sector since the unavailability of indigenous technologies and domestic suppliers leave no option for the players but to rely on high-cost import of machineries.

Similarly, a focus on 'emerging technologies' would be absolutely critical to radically transform the recycling industry in the future and make it globally competitive. For example, blockchain records transactional data throughout the recycling supply chain thereby helping ensure traceability of material flow from collectors to recyclers.

Such technologies combined with artificial intelligence could fundamentally change the way in which materials and natural resources are accounted for, valued and traded, incentivising individuals, companies and governments to unlock financial value from the so-called waste materials.

Considering the tremendous potential for reuse and recycling of products in India, there is a need for a more comprehensive national policy aiming at formalisation of the ecosystem and 'ease of doing business' for recyclers.

The policy may target at removing barriers for the input factors, establishing an electronic market-place for trading of scraps and recycled products, promoting public procurement of recycled material, harmonising the standards for scraps (ISRI and BIS standards) and establishing accredited testing labs and certification procedure. Following successful examples in China, government should look at setting up dedicated material recycling zones (MRZ), connected with large industrial areas and cities through reverse-logistics network.

Of late, the global community has started to recognize the long-term impact a circular economy could have towards climate change mitigation. Unfortunately, in India, as in many other developing countries, there has been little emphasis on 'circular economy' as an important pillar of NDC (Nationally Determined Contributions) for achieving low-carbon growth with social equity and inclusiveness. The reduce-reuse-recycle of wastes significantly reduces energy consumption in the commodity value chain.

For example, 17 trees, 2.5 barrels of oil, 4100 kWh of electricity, 4 cum of landfill and 31780 litres of water can be conserved by recycling 1 tonne of paper alone. In the same manner, recycling an aluminum can or producing a glass container eliminates 95% and 70% of energy required for producing a similar container from virgin material. To embed the topic in our national climate change narrative, there should be deeper empirical research on GHG impacts of potential circular economy actions across various sectors.

Policy, institution and technology are necessary but are not sufficient conditions by themselves to create a break-through in material recycling. As global examples and best-practices show, a 'circular economy' should be a core and embedded theme of the government’s key missions and programmes.

A fourth pillar is to bring in a behavioural change where every citizen naturally and intuitively segregates waste at the source. For this, the government and businesses alike should learn from successful zero waste systems implemented elsewhere in the world, mostly in EU, China, South Korea, where almost all construction and demolition wastes, paper, plastic, glass, metals etc., are typically recycled.

In India’s case, making it an integral part of Swachha Bharat, Smart City Mission, Make-in-India Mission etc., will be a crucial step to mainstream the circular economy and accelerate its adoption in all walks of life.",India,2019.03
923,Spotlight: Circular economy key to addressing urban waste crisis - Xinhua | English.news.cn,"NAIROBI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The fast growing cities in the Global South are grappling with waste crisis thanks to limited infrastructure and technical knowhow to promote recycling.

In many instances, urban centers in the developing world rely on landfills to dispose tonnes of waste generated by households and industries.

The growing waste crisis in less developed countries has been linked to the dominance of the linear economy where producers convert natural resources to products which consumers later dispose of in an environmentally unsustainable manner.

Nevertheless, policy makers and experts have identified circular economy as a long term solution to the growing urban waste crisis.

Siim Kiisler, president of the fourth session of the UN Environment Assembly and Estonia's minister for environment, said during the opening plenary that currently some two billion people worldwide lack access to solid waste collection services.

He observed that about 64 million people are directly affected by uncontrolled dumping and open burning at dumpsites.

In order to tackle the rising waste management crisis, Kiisler called upon UN member states to define national targets for reducing waste generation, increase reuse of products and recycling of waste and significantly reducing single-use plastic products by 2030.

The UN Environment Assembly which runs from March 11 to 15 brought together more than 4,000 delegates from 170 countries and regions to explore new strategies to promote environmental sustainability.

The youth have been at the frontline of adopting low cost technologies to establish waste recycling enterprises.

Experts said the circular economy is akin to a green economy because it promotes recycling of resources in a bid to reduce pressure on the earth's finite resources.

Jacob Hagberg, scientific advisor at Sweden Ministry of Environment and Energy, emphasized the need for the global community to invest in technologies to promote recycling of waste.

""The more waste that is used as raw materials for production of new products the better it is for environmental conservation efforts,"" said Hagberg.

The huge upfront cost of technology for recycling has been identified as a barrier to the transition to a circular economy. There are also technical challenges that have hindered the circular economy from gaining traction in low income economies.

Political influence from those benefiting from linear economy has also contributed to slow uptake of recycling.

However, sustainable transition to a circular economy will require a redesign of products to ensure that they are developed in a way that makes it easy for them to be recycled in future.

Most developing cities have a thriving informal recycling industry where plastics are collected and reused for the manufacture of consumer products.

However, these recycling efforts need to be scaled up as they are important sources of jobs for the youth.

Hagberg noted that recycling of waste is good for the environment. It also provides a source of sustainable jobs for millions of unemployed youth in big cities.

Kenyan manufacturers in the plastics value chain have formed a company to coordinate the recycling of plastic bottles.

Local plastic industry recycling firm PETCO has realized that the only way to create a sustainable recycling industry is to incorporate recycled material into locally made products.

Joyce Gachugi, country manager of PETCO Kenya, said that support for local industries to engage in plastic recycling will boost growth of the circular economy in the country.",China,2019.03
49,News Updates - The research findings of how to globalize the circular economy was published in Nature,"During the process of global economic development, problems such as inefficient use of resources, serious pollution of waste, uncontrolled emission of greenhouse gas, and excessive wastewater are emerging. Global demand for resource is projected to be doubled by 2050. Unreasonable resource exploitation and utilization is restricting economic development. Thus, sustainable resource management has become one inevitable choice for industrial development. Circular economy has been practiced in many countries and regions, such as China, US, EU, Japan and Korea. Nevertheless, circular-economy projects and relevant policies in different countries were developed based on their own situations without global consideration. The transnational circular-economy cooperation mechanism has not been established, resulting in a low level of circular economy development, for example the global recycling rate of industrial materials is only 6%. The rapid development of global economic integration and international trade requires that circular economy should break through geographical boundaries with close global cooperation. Therefore, to advance the globalization of circular economy, governments need to carry out international cooperation urgently through a systematic revolution of global industry system.Prof. Geng Yong from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Prof. Joseph Sarkis from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and Prof. Raimund Bleischwitz from University College London proposed policy recommendations on globalizing the circular economy based on the preliminary work. Their article “Globalize the circular economy” was published in the top journal Nature on 10th, Jan, 2019, which is the frontier study focusing on circular economy globalization by Chinese scholars. See the full paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00017-z.

This study points out that with the increasing use of sustainable materials, new markets and innovative business models, most circular-economy initiatives at the national level have helped reduce the materials, waste, energy and emissions. For example, some industries, such as the aluminum sector, are starting to monitor material flows globally to improve resource efficiency. Nonetheless, many fragmented circular-economy initiatives and networks still exist and are inefficient. Accurate, traceable and reliable data on the flows and stocks of most materials, and on the costs and efficiencies of industrial process, are lacking. Unfortunately, no international policy efforts integrate circular-economy approaches, leading to less benefits. Thus, it is urgent to implement innovative circular economy initiatives and prepare more appropriate policies.

In order to address these concerns, this study raised several strategies to globalize the circular economy, such as: (1) A global database should be set up to capture links between resource uses, including indicators on material, water and energy flows. (2) A global platform should be established for sharing knowledge on the circular economy. (3) International alliances should be created to promote large-scale experimentation. (4) Standards for performance measurement, reporting, accounting and future products need to be developed and implemented. (5) Policymakers should work together to prepare more appropriate regulations and enhance effective enforcement, resolve potential disputes at a global scale. The findings of this study provide valuable insights to promote the circular economy globalization and formulate international principles of sustainable resource management.

57,Could a digital barcode on consumer products enable the circular economy?,"One of the main reasons why global recycling rates are so low—just 20 per cent of the world’s plastic is recycled—is because people simply do not know how to recycle.

Too often, people throw non-recyclable stuff in with recyclables, unaware that this derails the whole process. Waste that has not been separated arrives at recycling plants and recyclers struggle to sort out what they can use from what they can’t.

But what if there was a system that made it easy to distinguish recyclables from non-recyclables? What if the lifecycle of every consumer product could be tracked, from factory to recycling plant?

This is now possible because products can be connected to the internet. And if a London-headquartered software startup called EVRYTHNG gets its way, pretty soon every product made and sold will carry a new type of barcode.

On that barcode is a unique web address for the product. When a consumer or recycler scans the barcode using a smartphone, they can get all sorts of information on the product from the web identity that is stored in the cloud, from where it was made and who made it, to the materials it is made from, and how to recycle it—a sort of LinkedIn profile page for consumer goods.

Knowing the origins of packaged products is crucial to tackling the plastic pollution crisis, says Niall Murphy, the founder and chief executive of EVRYTHNG, which counts fizzy drinks brand Coca-Cola and packaging giant WestRock as customers, and has offices in London, San Francisco, New York, Zurich and Singapore.

To respond to the plastic crisis, plastic producers “either have to provide organic based packaging, which composts itself, or have innovate so that packaging can become returnable—and that means that it has to be traceable,” Murphy says.

In this interview with Eco-Business, the tech entrepreneur talks about why companies should care about the traceability of their products, why digital labelling will take off in Asia, and the impact EVRYTHNG could have on the circular economy.

In a nutshell, how does EVRYTHNG work?

There are 4 trillion consumer products made and consumed every year. EVRYTHNG works with consumer product makers to put a tag on every physical product, from a can of Coke to a t-shirt.

The system works in three stages:

1. The consumer scans shopping receipts to import purchased products into a mobile app.

2. Through the mobile app, consumers can access information on where, when and how to recycle the different parts of each product based on local available infrastructure.

3. Consumers can then recycle items in street bins or preferred recycling centres. They can earn rewards by registering where they are recycling by scanning or tapping identity tags on recycling units.

Rewarding the consumer for recycling is really important, and they can post their recycling activity in social media. The programme also provides product information on what is being recycled back to the recycling firm.

How has EVRYTHNG been deployed so far?

The first app was launched at Carrefour supermarkets in Spain is called Reciclaya. It allows customers to determine how to recycle products by simply scanning the barcode on their supermarket receipt. More specifically, the app separates products into virtual recycling bins so that customers can place them in the nearest appropriate containers.

How will your technology have an impact in Asia?

It will for two reasons. First, because there’s a huge amount of supply chain production that comes from China and Southeast Asia. Second, because engagement between smartphone users and the physical world is higher in Asia than anywhere in the world. Last year, US$1.5 trillion was transacted in mobile payments through WeChat, for example.

When companies look at where they can make the most impact [in reducing their environmental footprint] it is Asia. Corporates are faced with significant challenges in their global supply chains, for instance, the counterfeiting of high value consumer goods, and a lot of those problems come from Asian markets. Transparency over the provenance of products can help address those issues.

Not everyone, particularly in developing markets, has a smartphone to scan a product for product or recycling info. How will you get around this reality?

Yes, this is of course a practical issue. But there are other ways of getting the information to consumers through scanners in stores—for instance, holding a product in front of a screen to get information about it.

To what extent do you think that consumers will care where products come from, particularly in Asia where sustainability is not as big an issue as in Europe?

Consumers may care less about the sustainability of a product in Asia, but they do care about authenticity and wellbeing. Global brands have liability in Europe and the US for practices they deploy in emerging markets. So part of this is consumer demand, but the other aspects are business accountability demands and taxation on landfill.

How do you ensure that the digital links can’t be forged and that the information given is genuine and accurate?

The unique identities provided for individual products are crypto-secure credentials. But obviously a QR code can be photocopied and therefore replicated. By being connected to a digital identity on the web we can detect duplications rapidly and therefore flag all products associated with that identity as suspect.

How long will it take before every consumer product has these digital links, and what do you see as the obstacles in the way of that happening?

Realistically it’s going to take two to three years for roll-out. Barriers include investment by packaging companies in digitally serialised printing for packaging, and upgrades to point of sale software by retailers.

Just as the technology behind blockchain uses an enormous amount of energy, have you looked into the energy footprint of the system for powering technology?

EVRYTHNG uses real-time analytics technologies in the cloud that are significantly more cost effective than Blockchain by several orders of magnitude. The reason Blockchain is so energy consuming is the huge amount of effort that goes in to mining and replicating transactions, neither of which are factors in realtime analytics systems like ours.

However, there is clearly energy consumed to manage data digitally about product items. What’s needed is a full cost analysis taking into consideration savings in materials, transport and waste. That kind of analysis across the full physically and digital lifecycle of a product has not been done, but I think would be very valuable.",Singapore,2019.03
58,Circular economy makes waves in Asia,"CONSUMER preference is becoming a key driver of business adoption of sustainable strategies and practices.

Research released by YouGov last year showed that 50 per cent of people in the Asia-Pacific region believe that businesses have the responsibility to ensure that their supply chains do not harm the environment.

This figure further increased in Singapore to 56 per cent and 63 per cent in the Philippines, with Jen Teo, executive director of the Singapore Environment Council highlighting that millennials were the drivers in spending more on sustainable goods. ""Companies that embrace sustainable and ethical practices will do better in the long run as more Singaporeans choose their products and services over those of their competitors.""

It is clear that market signals like these that are driving increasing interest and commitment to sustainable sourcing and manufacturing practices by business.

For much of the last 100 years, the mainstay of business growth has been the linear ""take-make-waste"" economic model which paid little attention to the long-term outcomes for the environment. Today, companies at the cutting edge are embracing the circular economy - an economic model that designs out waste and pollution, keeps products and materials in use for as long as possible and recovers what is considered waste, using it as a resource for production.

Currently, more than 90 per cent of used materials are discarded rather than cycled back into the economy. Put simply, this means valuable resources are literally going to waste. The circular economy makes better use of our planet's limited resources and is estimated to have the potential to generate US$4.5 trillion of additional economic output by 2030.

Pioneering the transition to the circular economy presents companies with new and diverse opportunities for growth. The ""Waves of Change"" collaboration between high-performance surfboard maker, Starboard, and DSM, a purpose-led global science-based company, is a novel example.

The premise of DSM's business strategy lends itself to creating value for all stakeholders across People, Planet and Profit, and ensuring all business groups and solutions ladder up to its commitment to contribute further to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

The Waves of Change initiative addresses both strategy objectives and involves collecting and recycling nearly 2,000 tonnes of discarded fishing nets, also known as ""ghost gear"" from the sea each year. A supply chain located around the coast of India engages around 300 people in various activities such as collection of fish nets, cleaning, handling, cutting, washing and packing before the material is compounded at DSM's plant in Pune. The result is a unique, repurposed resin containing recycled polyamide 6 at a maximum of 70 per cent of the composition which is reinforced with fibre glass to make key surfboard components.

Importantly, the upcycled material is cost competitive and outperforms newly-manufactured plastic. Response from surfer communities has been immediate and positive, encouraging Starboard to have all plastic components in the surfboards made with the same material.

'NOTHING IS WASTE UNTIL IT'S WASTED'

In a study by consulting firm Bain & Co involving 297 global firms released earlier this year, 81 per cent said sustainability is more important to their business today than it was five years ago. Experts said this global trend of companies making sustainability a bigger part of their business is also reflected in Singapore.

More opportunities for circular innovation are also emerging at home. Speaking at the St Gallen Symposium 2019 Singapore Forum, Temasek Holdings CEO Ho Ching stated that businesses must fulfil their obligation to ensure a liveable and sustainable planet besides pursuing financial returns.

Panellists at the CleanEnviro Summit Singapore 2018 engaged in conversation around market opportunities for businesses that dare to be creative and exploit high-tech developments to create smart waste collection systems, a gap as yet unfilled in Singapore and cities across Southeast Asia.

The Singapore government is also behind sustained efforts to encourage research and development in this area. In 2017, the National Environment Agency (NEA) announced its Closing the Waste Loop Initiative, a programme that funds collaborations between industry and research institutes to develop waste management solutions, including recovering value from waste streams like plastics, food and electrical products. More recently, Masagos Zulkifli, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, has laid renewed emphasis on Singapore's Zero Waste Nation campaign, declaring: 'Nothing is waste until it's wasted.'

The policy framework is also supportive, with the Singapore government behind sustained efforts to encourage research and development in this area.

With the strength of government support and increasing consumer expectations, first-movers in Singapore are well placed to capitalise on the commercial advantages of embracing circular supply chains. It is an opportunity not to be missed.

 National Productivity Council (NCP) has celebrated circular economy day on 12th Feb, 2019 and the theme of the celebration was circular economy for sustainable productivity. Today is the era of circular economy and the conventional linear economy should be changed. Circular economy is the new catch word for the developed economies and for developing economies like India. Circular economy should be the goal for the increase and use of the maximum productivity with efficiency and emphasis on sustainability. It should result in minimum waste of resources and essential ingredients which are scarce and are needed for production of goods and services. Thus circular economy aims at the recycling of the production and the objective is to reuse the scrap and residual of the products for economic use. Thus the waste of resources should be minimum and production should be maximum and the waste of any kind should be recycled into further production to ensure to fullest use of waste products and scrap. The tradition linear economy doctrine and practice is to make the product, use the product and throw the waste and this practice should be shunned for the overall benefit of the end users and the economy as well. Circular economy involves the production process which result into eco-friendly finished products and minimum of wastes and scraps in the best interests of the economy. In Japan and European countries circular economy is in full swing and in India even at present only 30 percent of the economy is circular and the rest 70 percent is still following conventional linear production processes under which make, use and throw is the guiding criteria. However, our developing economy is on the march of going circular and NPC and NITI Ayog is playing a significant role in this behalf and ensuring circular production processes which are eco friendly and result in less pollution of various kinds. For ensuing the circular economy Government, NCP, NITI Ayog, industrial associations, Chamber of commerce and Industry, NGOs and the general public can play their role so that circular economy experiments will be a success in India.

 But one thing is clear that the products as a result of circular economy being eco friendly but somewhat costly and then it depends upon consumers who will have to decide whether to buy traditional products of linear economy or the eco friendly products produced by circular economy. In this regard awareness and information campaigns about the benefits of using eco friendly products should be imparted to the consumers and they should also be made aware of the advantages of using and recycling the waste material and of converting the waste material and residues into production channels so that new useful products are given shape and there is minimum of wastage. In this regard, there is utmost need to segregate the industrial and domestic waste and also to segregate dry and liquid waste so that these are again channelized into process of conversion through production so that useful products are given shape for the benefit of society. The purpose of circular economy is also to ensure that there is very less waste of the materials and even no waste at all. In Japan, there is a city which follows and adheres to the principles and practice of circular economy and there is no waste at all in the production process and this city has become famous for having no waste. It has become a tourist destination and people from far and wide come to this city. Taking a cue from this experience the Indian industrialists and producers should see to it as how such a circular economy is made possible which leads to no waste and scrap. But this is far from reality for so many years from hence as we have not converted our linear economy into circular economy totally but efforts in this direction are on. It will take many-many years from today to see the full introduction and growth of the circular economic process which led to sustainable productivity with minimum of waste and maximum of efficiency and optimal use of all the scarce resources. A circular economy is an alternative to a traditional linear economy. Linear economy rests on the outdated principle of make, use and dispose. In circular economy we keep resources in use for as long as possible, extract the maximum value from them while in use, then recover and regenerate products and materials at the end of service life.

 It is an economic system where products and services are traded in closed loops or cycles. A circular economy is characterized as an economy which is regenerative by design with the purpose to retain as much value as possible of products, parts and materials. A circular economy is an economic system aimed at minimizing waste and making the most of the resources. This regenerative approach is in contrast to the traditional linear economy which has a make use and dispose model of production. According to Ellen Macathur Foundation, “It is looking beyond the current take, make, and waste extractive industrial model. A circular economy aims to redefine growth focusing on positive society – wide benefits. It entails gradually decupling economic activity from the consumption of finite resources and designing waste out of the system. Circular economy is based on three principles:

 * Design out waste and pollution.

 * Keep products and materials in use

 * Regenerate natural systems. Circular economy model synthesizes several major schools of thought.

 In a circular economic activity builds and rebuilds overall system health. The concept recognizes the importance of the economy needing to work effectively at all scales for large and small businesses for organizations and individuals globally and locally. Denmark, Netherlands, Scotland, Sweden, Japan follow circular economic model. In Denmark, resource strategy is passed which treats all waste as a resource that should either be recycled or reused. Those materials are used which do not contain toxic material. The commission estimates that circular economy can save EU businesses dollar 600 billion. Countries across the world are developing strategies for moving to a circular economy. Circular economy requires waste material strategies. A circular economy aims to maintain the value of the products, materials, resources for as long as possible. To sum up it is crystal clear that economies of the world are moving towards direction of circular economy and India is exception but in India it requires concerted efforts of the Government, NITI Ayog, NCP, Industrial organizations, trade and business houses, NGOs and public as the consumers and final users of the products.

228,Nestlé Philippines targets to use 100% recyclable packaging by 2025 | BusinessWorld,"WHILE it is working towards making the packaging of its products 100% recyclable in six years, Nestlé Philippines needs support from the government and other stakeholders on recycling efforts.

Kais Marzouki, the chairman and chief executive officer of Nestlé Philippines, said in a recent media briefing that the company has made 75% of their packaging recyclable.

“Plastic is a big topic in the Philippines. We are committed towards the goal that our company has set out, which is to make sure all our packaging is recyclable by 2025,” he said.

“But truth is already today, 75% of our packaging is recyclable. It doesn’t mean that it’s being recycled. So we need, and we are working with other companies and with government, to try to create a circular economy,” he added.

Nestlé Philippines handles several food brands in the country that are sold by retail: Nescafe, Coffee-mate, Milo, Nido, Bear Brand, Nestea, and Chuckie, among others.

Earlier this month, World Bank Acting Director for the Philippines Agata E. Pawlowska said in a Marine Plastics Conference that the country now has the highest rate of mismanaged plastics in the world.

“There is a lack of statistics on the amount of plastic in the Philippine waters. What is known is that the amount of mismanaged plastic waste is continuously increasing, and that the plastic crisis requires urgent action,” she said.

In December, House Bill No. 8692 was filed seeking a nationwide ban on single-use plastic products such as grocery bags, food packaging, water bottles, straws, cups and sachets. It is still on first reading at the House of Representatives.

Nestlé Philippines’ ready-to-drink business unit manager Veronica Caron V. Cruz said the carton boxes used for the Chuckie packaging is being regularly collected to be recycled as paper.

“Actually the Chuckie packaging is recyclable. So what we do is right now we collect in specific areas the used beverage cartons… And we have a mill in Bulacan. We work with Tetra Pak, we have a paper mill and we grind it, and we get the paper. In fact now, in Chuckie promo packs, if you see the sleeves that we have, it’s recycled paper already,” she said.

She added that this year is the first time Nestlé Philippines is using recycled paper for its promotion packs. The company intends to continue finding ways to recycle the waste from product packaging.

“The goal is to get more people to bring in the used box cartons, used beverage cartons into the mill so we get to recycle more. And what we do is really use it back, then it becomes a complete cycle,” Ms. Cruz added. — Denise A. Valdez",Singapore,2019.04
280,Five ways to unlock the value of the circular economy,"Governments and businesses are sitting on a massive opportunity to lessen their climate impact and drive up revenue and consumer satisfaction by moving toward a circular economy. A “circular economy” is one that can:
• Be regenerative by design, retaining as much value as possible from products, parts and materials
• Mitigate the climate impact of continually manufacturing new products
• Recoup the $4.5 trillion wasted in the current take-make-waste consumer model

The concept of a circular economy has begun to go global. Over the last year, it has featured prominently at many major conferences, demonstrating its growing currency. Yet the gears of the global economy—from finance and business models to consumer behavior and law—still embed waste as a necessary if unfortunate by-product of a successful economy.

Here are 5 ways governments, working with the private sector, can begin shifting their economies toward this more sustainable model.

Beginning in the 1970s, governments—in their role as stewards of public health and environmental protection—adopted the concept of a waste hierarchy to set preferences for managing waste. This hierarchy, centered on public health and environmental protection, resulted in policies and infrastructure focused on diverting waste from landfills and creating value through recycling and energy capture.

For example, waste-to-energy facilities create value from materials that would otherwise be landfilled.

But the waste hierarchy optimises a bad situation without addressing root issues; it focuses on managing waste rather than maximising the utilisation of materials as a resource, such as by extending the life of products and recovering valuable materials for new products. For example, the current system of electronics recycling inadequately recovers metals for reuse.

Governments need to replace their waste hierarchies with a circularity hierarchy, which would maximise the utilization of materials by extending the life of products and extracting optimal value once they’re discarded to turn them into new products.

Under this new paradigm, all policies, including taxes, would be required to demonstrate, through a lifecycle-based analysis, achievement of the highest-possible level of circularity. Implementing this hierarchy requires governments to enable industry innovation without being overly prescriptive (which would hinder innovation) or lowering public health standards.

The flow of materials from mining to manufacturing to use is responsible for 50 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. National climate plans under the Paris Agreement—known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)—should be updated to incorporate three key levers of the circular economy: value-retention processes, secondary materials and the supply chain.

Value-retention processes extend products’ lives through reuse, repair, refurbishment or remanufacturing. A recent report from the UN International Resources Panel (IRP) looked at three industrial sectors in the United States, China, Brazil and Germany. It found that extending the life of products through value-retention processes could reduce raw materials by as much as 80-99 per cent and decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in some sectors by 79-99 per cent. But a circular economy doesn’t stop there.

Once a product’s life is maximised through value-retention processes, recovering and reusing its materials in a new product can also have significant climate benefits. A recent study concluded that reusing aluminum, steel and plastics in Nordic economies could reduce emissions by 96 per cent, 86 per cent and 37 per cent, respectively, compared to emissions when products use raw materials.

Finally, the supply chain offers an overlooked opportunity to link these circular economy levers. A recent study concluded that emissions in a company’s supply chain are around four times as high as those from direct operations—but only about a quarter of companies engage their supply chains to reduce emissions.

If governments send a signal through their NDCs to business and align them with policy enablers to focus on these three levers — value-retention processes and secondary materials linked in the supply chain — they can drive circularity and reduce emissions.

The Basel Convention is an international treaty designed to reduce the movement of hazardous waste between nations, particularly from developed to less developed countries, due to concerns regarding the public health consequences of dumping. Countries’ adoption of laws implementing the Basel Convention serves as a critical check against problematic cross-border flows of waste.

However, the convention can impede remanufacturing of post-use products and recovering secondary materials from manufacturing and used products. So, while electric vehicle lithium batteries can be repurposed, some countries treat them as hazardous waste, which has the effect of hindering circularity.

In this author’s opinion, comprehensive reform of the Convention to incorporate circular principles is unlikely in the foreseeable future. But countries can accelerate circularity by streamlining implementing requirements with rigorous transparency to encourage remanufacturing and secondary materials use.

France, the Netherlands, the U.K. and Flanders have established a cross-border framework to harmonize administrative requirements to recover materials from used electronics for use in new products while adhering to existing legal requirements and public oversight.

Similarly, as recommended by the IRP, governments can also reclassify certain eligible products for remanufacturing as “non-waste” while remaining vigilant against dumping.

Reexamining existing national regulations for opportunities to promote closed-loop manufacturing and remanufacturing can result in environmental and economic benefits.

Governments should amend recycling regulations to incentivize comprehensive use of materials, helping manufacturers recognise how to minimize loss of materials and maximise value. The U.S. EPA enacted one such rule that removes from the “waste” category manufacturing residuals returned in a closed loop to production. The EPA also strengthened requirements on recyclers to safely manage against risk of fires, explosions, accidents and release of hazardous materials. The changes are projected to save $59 million in materials and reduce emissions by 344 kilotons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year.

Our current take-make-waste economy doesn’t reward making products that last, or that are easily reused, repurposed, repaired or recycled.

Governments should nudge companies to design products that retain their value or that enable recovery of materials as secondary feedstock. This can be done through tax policies that favor remanufactured goods. Currently, such products are largely taxed as new, which effectively penalises them since they were previously taxed during the original manufacturing. China, for example, has reduced taxes on products that include “waste resources,” such as industrial metal waste.

Governments can also set goals for minimum recycled content. China’s Producer Responsibility Extension System Implementation Program targets 20 per cent recycled content in new products in electronics, batteries and automobiles by 2025. Similarly, the EU Commission is currently evaluating eco-design rules to foster circularity.

The promise of the circular economy

When carefully measured, designed, and integrated, the circular economy holds promise for the environment, consumers, businesses and governments, as it can:
• Derive even more value from products

Currently the circular economy is generating considerable interest in many sectors. These are five concrete, near-term actions that governments and the private sector can take to realise reduced material intensity and improved GHG outcomes.

393,Global Change Award 2019 winners have been announced,"Lab-grown leather, clothes that grow and a tech take on crafting a truly circular economy are among this year's Global Change Award winners. And to further support the victors, the H&M Foundation, the non-profit arm established by the Swedish multinational, has announced a new initiative with crowdfunding platform Indiegogo, which gives consumers an active role, allowing and encouraging them to back the pioneers.

Announced at Stockholm's City Hall—the venue where the Nobel Prize is presented, a sign of the award's scale and aspired influence—this year's crop of winners are nothing short of game-changing. Selected from a record-breaking 6,640 entries (up from 2,600 last year) and 182 countries, each entry aims to accelerate the shift towards a more sustainable future in rather unique and wonderful ways.

""The winners prove that it's possible to improve the environmental impact of the fashion industry,” says Karl-Johan Persson, board member of the H&M Foundation and CEO of H&M. “It's now up to the industry to be bold and pilot these innovations with customers in a commercial context,” adds H&M Foundation's innovation lead, Erik Bang.

The five winners will share a €1 million (Rs. 77,700,930 approx) grant—plus whatever is raised through the crowdfunding site—and gain access to a year-long accelerator programme run in partnership with consultancy firm Accenture and Stockholm's KTH Royal Institute of Technology. The aim is to get their technology to market as quickly as possible by providing them with support and access to key industry leaders.

Here are the winning entries, set to redesign the future of fashion:

This year's first-place winner, taking the lion's share of the prize (Rs. 2,33,21,730 approx), aims to create a system which supports a truly circular economy through technology. Starting at the design stage, the German system specifies how each choice of material, cut and production affects the planet. The details are saved into a unique “circularity.ID”, which consumers and recycling facilities can also access, encouraging reusing and recycling of fashion.

This Switzerland-based duo has turned to the great outdoors for a solution, creating a non-toxic, biodegradable, mineral-based and fluorine-free alternative. The innovative, micro-thin membrane will guard any garment against the elements, without harming the environment.

Kenya's Green Nettle Textile tackles sustainable fashion and looks to boost local economy in one fell swoop. Using stinging nettles as a raw material—the resilient and low-maintenance plants grow easily in the region—the stalks are turned into a linen-like (sting-free) fabric, and the leftovers are turned into paper and dyes. The sweetest byproduct? Creating job opportunities for 200,000 small holder farmers across the country.

403,What goes comes back in time,"One of the constants in life is change, and what has been changing at the fastest rate is technology.

By the time we acknowledge, acquire and get used to a certain technology, there is its upgraded, so called better version already on the market, rendering our prized (read as valuable and costly) possession less worthy.

By the time you garner the courage to acquire and then flaunt your I Phone X in one of its many versions, around the corner, most probably in September, you may fasten your seat belts for yet another updated model THE IPHONE XI. The madness and hype are such that, after Game of Thrones 8th Season, the I Phone XI's alleged technology and design leaks are the most popular feeds on social media and people are lapping it up, just as they would when pre-ordering the yet to be launched, the latest of the latest versions. By the way it is touted to be the costliest one too… (yet another rumour/ prediction).



Where does that leave the old phone…in the bin or given away for recycling, or as it in India given away to a poor relative in most cases the wife, at times a cousin and in some cases to friends, before throwing it in the dustbin. As per estimates (Global E-waste Monitor 2017), the total e-waste generated in Asia in 2016 was 18.2 million tonnes (mt). India's share of this was around 2 mt, and that of course includes all digital equipment).

While a few companies urge the customers to give back their old equipment in order to put it back on approved recycling process, reports estimate that in India 90% of e-waste is collected and processed by informal sector.

That in layman terms means that once the required parts are collected, the boards are burnt for copper, and the waste goes into landfills, chemical fumes get into the air we breathe, and toxicity spreads to ground water.

Now for the good old days that are often remembered in vain…long ago we bought a television that had sliding wooden doors to cover the screen when not in use, a screen that only projected black and white pictures.

It stayed loyal for many years until the colour TV made its debut. Solidaire, it was – that stayed through thick and thin, enthralling us in moments of despair, keeping us company in merriment.

Then we bought a refrigerator. It was from the good old Allwyn – Jo awaaz hi nahi karta – Doesn't make any noise said the advertisement. However, much to our chagrin it did make noise, but that never bothered us.

Even the fridge stayed with us for ever and ever. And when any one of these had a minor glitch, we knew where to tap it or knock it and it would be fine all over again.

Then came the invention of the millennium – the computer and its binary code. The same code that held the fascination of generations of humans and Sheldon Cooper of 'Big Bang Theory'.

And with it started innovation and a big bang of technology creating mindboggling devices to do everything, possible and possibly impossible tasks. Wants increased, and along with food, clothing and shelter, a bunch of other things were included in our basic needs – a mobile phone for one.

In this rush to acquire new, newer technologically upgraded devices, the one thing that's cropping up from environmentalists and learned is circular economy – and that eventually would mean that the electronic products must be designed for reuse, durability and safe recycling.

408,UN Environment official calls for dialogue to solve palm oil dispute with EU,"Indonesia should stay in the Paris climate deal and lead efforts to curb global warming under the accord, the Asia-Pacific head for UN Environment said on Friday, urging greater dialogue in the country's spat with the European Union over palm oil.

Last week, Indonesia - the world's biggest producer of the cheap vegetable oil - said it might consider exiting the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change if the EU went ahead with a decision to phase out palm oil in renewable transportation fuel. The Southeast Asian nation, home to the world's third-largest tropical forests, lashed out at the EU after the bloc classified palm oil as a risky crop that caused deforestation and ruled its use in biofuel should stop by 2030.

""We need countries like Indonesia in the Paris Agreement, taking forward their commitments quite seriously,"" said Dechen Tsering, Asia-Pacific director for the United Nations' environment agency in Bangkok. ""It is our hope that there will be better dialogue and communication, so both sides recognise the constraints and the issues,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview.

Environmentalists and many consumers blame much of Indonesia's loss of forests and its smog-causing fires on land clearance for growing palm, whose oil is used in everything from margarine to biscuits, soap to soups, and biodiesel. Last week, Luhut Pandjaitan, Indonesia's coordinating minister overseeing maritime and natural resources, told a conference that if the United States and Brazil could consider leaving the Paris deal, why should Indonesia not too.

""It would undermine the Paris Agreement,"" Tsering said by phone. ""Even though the United States (is) working towards withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, you've had states and the private sector taking on very strong commitments."" In Indonesia, by contrast, ""it is the central government that is taking on the ambition and leadership, so (it is) quite a different scenario"", she added.

Under the Paris accord, Indonesia has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 29 per cent by 2030, a target that could rise to 41 per cent with international support. Tsering said Indonesia had sought external expertise on tackling forest fires in the last few years and set up a global institute to protect peatlands.

A new $3-billion mass rapid transit (MRT) system for its capital, Jakarta, was also proof the country was taking its international climate pledges seriously, she added. Tsering, who is from Bhutan, said the Asia-Pacific region more broadly was falling behind on efforts to shift to a ""circular economy"", and needed to improve the way it recycles and reuses its natural resources.

The amount of materials the world uses has tripled since 1970 and could double again by 2050 if no action is taken, the United Nations estimates. In Asia, fast-developing economies and urbanisation are driving huge investments in construction and infrastructure, offering chances to promote a circular economy, experts say.

The region should share its knowledge on food waste, waste management and ways for industry to use energy and water more efficiently, to assist countries lagging behind, Tsering said. Tax incentives and new policies would also help, she said, adding public procurement should lead the private sector on sustainability and green standards.",India,2019.04

Become part of the Circular Living movement at the Circular Living Symposium 2019: Upcycling Our Planet

Why should you care about Circular Living?

The world’s natural resources are under threat. Now is the time for a “resource revolution” — a whole new way to get the most benefit from the natural resources that remain. Circular Living is the solution that will drive this revolution by minimizing waste and extracting the greatest value from the planet’s resources.

Four reasons why you should be at this Symposium

You will hear from international leaders in the Circular Economy who are already making the world a better place.

We’re bringing in some of the world’s most innovative thinkers who are driving the Circular Economy phenomenon. Rob Opsomer from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation; Arthur Huang, CEO of MINIWIZ, who believes “trash is sexy”; and Dr. Jenna Jambeck, a National Geographic Explorer whose research was used in policy discussions by the Global Ocean Commission. They are just some of the people who initiated the Circular Economy movement and will be at the event.

You will learn about the Circular Economy, the global movement to drive sustainability.

With the Circular Economy, used plastics are fed back into the system as raw materials for new items. This conserves existing natural resources while reducing waste. By incorporating Circular Living into your lifestyle, you play an important role in protecting the planet’s future.

You will get lots of great ideas about how to make Circular Living part of your life and business.

The Symposium will host many international and local innovators sharing their experiences and offering insights into Circular Living. By the end of the day, you will have valuable insights into how you can adopt a Circular Living lifestyle and useful approaches that you can apply and share.

536,Cambodia puts circular economy in motion,"Climate risks and demand by Cambodia’s garment customers for international standard waste compliance are inevitably pushing the Kingdom towards a circular economy.

Global temperatures are expected to rise at a minimum of 1.5C beginning 2018, according to United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) last year.

The report states that the depletion of natural resources will affect people, especially the poor, who depend on resources for their survival.

To avoid a climate catastrophe, the IPCC argued for the necessity of urgent action across the globe.

United Nations Development Program in Cambodia resident representative Nick Beresford says there ought to be ways to transform the way the economy operates and consumes resources.

The current economic model is linear, moving from extraction to production, consumption and disposal.

“By improving resource efficiency, promoting the use of renewable and clean energy, and the 4Rs (refuse, reuse, recycle and reduce), we can transfer to a non-waste based circular economy,” the Capital Cambodia quoted Beresford as saying.

A circular economy defines solid waste management where plastic pollution is reduced, renewable energy increased, and management of protected areas are improved.

“This is a revolutionary change in mindset. Wide adoption of circular economy models can significantly reduce the use of natural resources and energy, waste, greenhouse gas emission, and pollution,” he says.

Cambodia is at the beginning, exploring options to move towards a circular economy, first with waste management based on a project launched last March.

“It is a great effort for a small country like Cambodia to take the lead in promoting high-end organic products,” he adds.

Three years ago, a report by UN Conference for Trade and Development showed that if India adopted circular principles, it could save about US$218 billion in economic value by 2030 and up to $624 billion by 2050.

By 2040, if China practices a circular economy, pollution of fine particulate matter could drop by 50%, greenhouse gases by 23% and traffic congestion by 47%.

To date, there has been no studies on the benefits relating to Cambodia’s adoption of circular economy.

“However, Cambodia aspires to move towards it. Waste can become the source or raw material,” says E Vuthy, deputy secretary of the Secretariat of the National Council for Sustainable Development.

Environment Ministry data shows that waste generated daily in Phnom Penh amounts to 1,800 tonnes to 2,000 tonnes. Of that, 55% is organic waste, 21% plastic, 13% textile, leather, diapers, and 5% paper. Stone and ceramic waste make up three percent, and glass is two percent.

Vuthy says although there is no target date for Cambodia to have a circular economy, it can start by charting a roadmap or framework, and raise public awareness.

Garment Manufacturers Association of Cambodia deputy secretary-general Kaing Monika says that abiding by environmental regulations is no longer an option. It is a demand by the market and consumers to comply with international standards.

“Some of our buyers and member factories have joint sustainability programs to ensure solid waste management and energy efficiency. Global brands like Adidas and H&M take this matter seriously,” Monika says.

In relation to that, GMAC is currently discussing with the ministry and Chip Mong Insee Cement Corp over the possibility of using waste fabric to produce energy for cement production.

He states while there are environment-related laws, more regulations are expected in the future.

“But the push to change will come from consumer behaviour and calls for international standards to be practiced,” Monika adds.",Thailand,2019.05
542,ITRI drops manufacturing growth forecast to 0.02% - Taipei Times,"US sanctions on Huawei would likely hurt suppliers, but the return of overseas-based Taiwanese firms should lessen the effects of the US-China trade dispute

The government-sponsored Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI, 工研院) on Friday cut its growth forecast for the production value of Taiwan’s manufacturing sector for this year to 0.02 percent, citing a weakening global economy amid trade frictions.

Estimating the output of the local manufacturing sector to be NT$19.26 trillion (US$611 billion), the institute’s forecast team downgraded its growth forecast for the year by 1.56 percentage points.

The forecast was lowered largely to reflect a weakening global economy amid trade disputes between the US and China, the team said.

Taiwan’s export-oriented manufacturing sector would suffer further if the US-China trade dispute is not resolved, as global trade would deteriorate, it said.

In addition, business restrictions by Washington are expected to deal a serious blow to Huawei Technologies Co (華為), the second-largest smartphone brand in the world, and many of its Taiwanese suppliers could suffer, the ITRI said.

Among the major Taiwanese suppliers to Huawei are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (台積電), the world’s largest contract chipmaker, and ASE Technology Holding Co (日月光投資控股), the world’s largest integrated circuit packaging and testing services provider.

The US-China trade dispute would also weaken global consumption and investment, which would undermine confidence in Taiwan’s manufacturing sector, especially the electronics industry, it said.

However, the effect of the trade dispute would be mitigated in Taiwan to some extent by the return of overseas-based Taiwanese companies, it said.

So far this year, 61 Taiwanese firms have committed to returning, bringing back combined investment of NT$310 billion, Ministry of Economic Affairs data showed.

Separately, the government’s “five plus two” industries are expected to create about 30,000 jobs per year over the next three years, National Development Council data showed.

In a forecast on the local job market on Friday, the council said that the most jobs — about 12,000 per year — would be created in the semiconductor sector, one of the five plus two industries.

Among the other industries, smart machinery is expected to create 9,000 jobs per year and biotech 3,000, while the green energy, smart machinery, defense, new agriculture and circular economy sectors would each account for 1,000, the council said.

The digital economy, artificial intelligence and financial technology sectors are expected to each create more than 1,000 jobs per year, it said.

More than 90 percent of five plus two companies need employees with at least a college degree and at least two years experience in related work, the council said.

""The EC will soon adopt new guidelines on integrating ecosystem and green infrastructure services into decision-making,"" the commissioner said at the end of the two-day informal meeting of Environment Ministers of the European Union (EU).

""Europe's attitude towards biodiversity demonstrates that a large majority of the population is concerned about the loss of biodiversity and recognizes the links between it and climate change,"" Vella said.

According to him, the meeting has discussed two pressing themes in the field of the environment, namely biodiversity and water quality, and revealed a number of positive aspects, showing that the EU, working together, can make effective progress.

As far as water quality is concerned, the EC official stressed the problem of the presence of plastics in drinking water and referred to the plastic strategy, with the emblematic initiative banning the use of disposable plastics and the reduction of plastic waste from all sources.

In his turn, Romania's Water and Forests Minister Ioan Denes said that joint efforts are needed at European level to combat the pollution of seas and oceans with river-borne plastics and microplastics or non-plastics, and better cooperation between manufacturers, recyclers, traders, consumers and decision-makers is very important.

The minister stressed that an important element of the fight against water pollution is the public awareness, adding that the competent authorities and those in charge of water management must coordinate in order to identify new solutions and measures.

On Monday, the first working session of the informal meeting included debates on climate change, when participants discussed the measures to be taken at European and national level to boost the transformation of the life style and to create the necessary framework for the transition to a climate-neutral society.",China,2019.05
615,The Body Shop’s Plastic Makeover,"Our planet is drowning in plastic. The devastating effect of plastic waste on our oceans is well known. However, there is a human element to the crisis, which is rarely discussed. Over three billion people live without formal waste management – that’s almost half the planet’s population. This has given rise to an informal waste picking economy. The Body Shop has launched its first Community Trade Recycled Plastic from Bengaluru, India. The initiative highlights the lesser-known, human side of the plastic crisis. By 2020 recycled plastic from India will go into the making of Body Shop’s haircare bottles.

The Body Shop wants to fight more than plastic pollution. It wants to drive social change and help empower people at the same time. To mark this launch, the company has unveiled a giant artwork of a female Indian waste picker in London’s Borough Market. Some of the world’s most marginalised people pick untreated waste to try to make a living. These waste pickers, many of them women, often live below the poverty line, work in appalling conditions and are shunned by society. Yet they form a critical line of defence in stopping plastic from entering our rivers and oceans.The Body Shop is launching its first Community Trade Recycled Plastic, in partnership with Plastics For Change. Community Trade is The Body Shop’s bespoke and independently-verified fair trade programme. Launching on World Fair Trade Day, this is a commitment to tackling the plastic crisis differently. Walking away from plastic altogether is not the answer. If used responsibly and given value, plastic can be sustainable. The Body Shop wants to use plastic recycling to help transform lives.

India alone has 1.5 million waste pickers who collect and sort over 6,000 tonnes of plastic every day that would otherwise pollute our rivers and oceans. The majority of India’s waste pickers are Dalits, previously known as ‘untouchables’. This means that they have virtually no visibility in society and have limited rights. They are vulnerable to discrimination, poor living and working conditions and an unpredictable payment system for the plastic they collect.

Shriti Malhotra, CEO, The Body Shop India says, “We recognize that the plastic waste crisis is a formidable environmental challenge, yet often ignore the fact that the waste picker community is unarguably, the human face of that crisis. Hasiru Dala, our local partner will work with the waste picker community directly. And we will support the waste pickers with a fair price for their labour and stable income, more sanitary working conditions, access to education, healthcare and financial services and the respect and recognition they deserve in society.”

Anamma, former waste picker and current Dry Waste Collection Centre Manager, Bengaluru says, “I have been picking waste for around 30 years, since I was a child. This is a really tough and physically demanding industry to be in. Waste pickers face all kinds of hardships, including harassment, late payments and health issues. However, through waste picking I have managed to raise a family and send my children to college. I am really proud of what I do. I believe we play a very important role in keeping cities clean and helping to recycle the huge amounts of plastic waste that society produces.”

With over three decades of working with disadvantaged communities around the world, The Body Shop is applying its expertise to help tackle the plastic crisis. An abundance of recyclable plastic already exists. In partnership with Plastics for Change, The Body Shop has started using community trade recycled plastic in its 250ml haircare bottles, including its bestselling Ginger Shampoo . The bottles will contain 100 per cent recycled plastic (excluding the bottle caps). Of that, 15 percent will be Community Trade recycled plastic, the remainder will be recycled plastic from European sources. The Body Shop will increase the amount of Community Trade Recycled plastic over time. Working with a start-up company and small waste picker communities means starting small and scaling up in a responsible and sustainable manner.

In its first year, The Body Shop will purchase 250 tonnes of Community Trade recycled plastic to use in nearly three million 250ml haircare bottles by the end of 2019. This marks the start of a wider ambition, which is to introduce Community Trade Recycled plastic across all PET plastic used by The Body Shop within three years. Over the course of three years the programme will scale up to purchasing over 900 tonnes of Community Trade Recycled Plastic and help empower up to 2,500 waste pickers in Bengaluru. They will receive a fair price for their work, a predictable income and access to better working conditions. They will also get help in accessing services such as education, financial loans and healthcare services, and the respect and recognition they deserve.

The Body Shop and Plastics for Change will work alongside local partners such as Hasiru Dala, a non-governmental organisation that fights for waste picker rights, and Hasiru Dala Innovations, a social enterprise dedicated to creating essential employment opportunities for waste pickers. Hasiru Dala is a social impact organisation that focuses on securing social justice for waste pickers. This is done collaboratively with the waste pickers, in the areas of: identity rights, access to family education, healthcare, housing and pension, skill development, market and employment access, and multi-tier policy advocacy. Hasiru Dala works with communities in Bengaluru, Mysuru,Chamrajnagar, Chikkamanguluru and Coorg districts and is an anchor member of the Alliance for Indian Wastepickers (AIW).

Hasiru Dala Innovations is a for-profit social enterprise that is focused on creating better livelihoods for waste pickers through inclusive businesses that have an environmental impact. It currently offers waste management and aggregation services to ensure equitable, fair pricing for waste pickers. The company leverages the entrepreneurship spirit of waste pickers and enables them to integrate into the mainstream economy with the ultimate goal of helping them become independent.

Lee Mann, Global Community Trade Manager for The Body Shop says, “As a company, we have always had the conviction to stand up for our principles when it comes to helping empower people, especially women, while protecting our planet. Our new partnership with Plastics for Change and our other partners will not only help support waste pickers but also champion plastic as a valuable renewable resource when used responsibly.”

Lee encourages Indian customers to participate in their in-store recycling scheme, BBOB (Bring Back Our Bottles). This encourages people to help the planet and return their empty bottles and this move is currently being executed at 15 stores in Delhi NCR and Bengaluru.

Andrew Almack, CEO of Plastics for Change says, “Plastic recycling is a major source of income for the one percent of the world’s most marginalised urban population and we are incredibly excited to partner with The Body Shop and other partners to help these groups get the financial and social benefits they deserve. This is the world’s first ever programme of verified Fair Trade plastic collection for use in recycling.”

Nalini Shekar, Co-Founder and Executive Director for Hasiru Dala says, “We set up Hasiru Dala and Hasiru Dala Innovations with the goal of giving waste pickers a formal identity in Bengaluru to enable them to fight for their rights and a fair place in society. Our new partnership with The Body Shop and Plastics for Change is another huge leap in recognising the relentless work our waste pickers carry out each day despite being faced with so many challenges.” Community Trade recycled plastic is just one part of the company's commitment to making its packaging more sustainable. The Body Shop is making recycling empty packaging easier and more accessible than ever before.

Initially available in five countries - UK, Australia, Canada, France and Germany - this partnership enables customers to return their empty bottles, jars, tubs, tubes and pots, in store, so TerraCycle® can recycle, where possible, in the local market environment. If recycling is not possible, TerraCycle® will repurpose the packaging into new consumer products such as benches or watering cans. The Body Shop aims to rapidly expand schemes like this within its global network and ensure every store has an in-store recycling solution2. Ultimately, the company plans to close the loop and re-use the plastic in packaging, or in shop fixtures.

Plastics For Change enables global brands and manufacturers to source high-quality recycled plastic from responsible supply chains. The company is verified by the World Fair Trade Organisation Organization. Its mobile platform and deal process provides waste pickers with access to fair and consistent income opportunities. It has developed an ethical sourcing platform to create sustainable livelihoods for the urban poor, while transitioning the industry towards a circular economy. Similar to fair trade agriculture, the platform creates transparency and accountability from the base of the supply chain to the store shelf. This results in more efficient shared-value chains and higher quality recycled plastic. It provides expertise to help catalyse brands and manufacturers to replace the use of new plastic with ethically-sourced recycled plastic, thereby immediately improving the social and environmental impact of its products and complying with Extended Producer Responsibility legislation.",India,2019.05
625,How US recycling plants are benefiting from China's ban on scrap imports,"China's ban on imports of wastepaper and plastic might have disrupted US recycling programs has also spurred investment in American plants that process recyclables. US paper mills are expanding capacity to take advantage of a glut of cheap scrap. Some facilities that previously exported plastic or metal to China have retooled so they can process it themselves.

And in a twist, the investors include Chinese companies that are still interested in having access to wastepaper or flattened bottles as raw material for manufacturing. ""It's a very good moment for recycling in the United States,"" said Neil Seldman, co-founder of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a Washington-based organization that helps cities improve recycling programs.

China, which had long been the world's largest destination for paper, plastic and other recyclables, phased in import restrictions in January 2018. Global scrap prices plummeted, prompting waste-hauling companies to pass the cost of sorting and baling recyclables on to municipalities. With no market for the wastepaper and plastic in their blue bins, some communities scaled back or suspended curbside recycling programs.

New domestic markets offer a glimmer of hope. About USD 1 billion in investment in US paper processing plants has been announced in the past six months, according to Dylan de Thomas, a vice president at The Recycling Partnership, a nonprofit organization that tracks and works with the industry.

Hong Kong-based Nine Dragons, one of the world's largest producers of cardboard boxes, has invested $500 million over the past year to buy and expand or restart production at paper mills in Maine, Wisconsin and West Virginia. In addition to making paper from wood fibre, the mills will add production lines turning more than a million tons of scrap into pulp to make boxes, said Brian Boland, vice president of government affairs and corporate initiatives for ND Paper, Nine Dragons' US affiliate.

""The paper industry has been in contraction since the early 2000s,"" Boland said. ""To see this kind of change is frankly amazing. Even though it's a Chinese-owned company, it's creating US jobs and revitalizing communities like Old Town, Maine, where the old mill was shuttered."" The Northeast Recycling Council said in a report last fall that 17 North American paper mills had announced increased capacity to handle recyclable paper since the Chinese cutoff.

Another Chinese company, Global Win Wickliffe, is reopening a shuttered paper mill in Kentucky. Georgia-based Pratt Industries is constructing a mill in Wapakoneta, Ohio that will turn 425,000 tons of recycled paper per year into shipping boxes. Plastics also has a lot of capacity coming online, de Thomas said, noting new or expanded plants in Texas, Pennsylvania, California and North Carolina that turn recycled plastic bottles into new bottles.

Chinese companies are investing in plastic and scrap metal recycling plants in Georgia, Indiana and North Carolina to make feedstocks for manufacturers in China, he said. In New Brunswick, New Jersey, the recycling company GDB International exported bales of scrap plastic film such as pallet wrap and grocery bags for years. But when China started restricting imports, company president Sunil Bagaria installed new machinery to process it into pellets he sells profitably to manufacturers of garbage bags and plastic pipe.

He said the imports cutoff that China calls ""National Sword"" was a much-needed wake-up call to his industry. ""The export of plastic scrap played a big role in facilitating recycling in our country,"" Bagaria said. ""The downside is that infrastructure to do our own domestic recycling didn't develop.""

Now that is changing, though he said far more domestic processing capacity will be needed as a growing number of countries restrict scrap imports. ""Ultimately, sooner or later, the society that produces plastic scrap will become responsible for recycling it,"" he said.

It has also yet to be seen whether the new plants coming on line can quickly fix the problems for municipal recycling programs that relied heavily on sales to China to get rid of piles of scrap. ""Chinese companies are investing in mills, but until we see what the demand is going to be at those mills, we're stuck in this rut,"" said Ben Harvey, whose company in Westborough, Massachusetts, collects trash and recyclables for about 30 communities.

He had a parking lot filled with stockpiled paper a year ago after China closed its doors, but eventually found buyers in India, Korea and Indonesia. Keith Ristau, CEO of Far West Recycling in Portland, Oregon, said most of the recyclable plastic his company collects used to go to China. Now most goes to processors in Canada or California.

To meet their standards, Far West invested in better equipment and more workers at its material recovery facility to reduce contamination. In Sarepta, Louisiana, IntegriCo Composites is turning bales of hard-to-recycle mixed plastics into railroad ties. It expanded operations in 2017 with funding from New York-based Closed Loop Partners.

""As investors in domestic recycling and circular economy infrastructure in the US, we see what China has decided to do as very positive,"" said Closed Loop founder Ron Gonen.",India,2019.05
638,Timor-Leste to become world's first plastic-neutral nation,"KUALA LUMPUR - In a region where seas are awash with trash, Timor-Leste is set to become the world's first country to recycle all its plastic waste after it teamed up with Australian researchers on Friday (May 17) to build a revolutionary recycling plant.

The US$40 million (S$55 million) plant will ensure that no plastic used in the South-east Asian nation would become waste, but would instead be turned into new products.

Dili said it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Australia's Mura Technology to establish a non-profit called Respect that will run the plastic recycling plant, expected to launch by the end of 2020.

""This is a small country where we can make a statement - making the whole country the first to be plastic neutral, in a region where there is the largest pollution of marine life,"" said Professor Thomas Maschmeyer, co-inventor of the recycling technology to be used in the new plant.

""Plastic - if you don't dispose of it well - is a terrible thing, (but) if you can dispose of it well, it's a great thing,"" Prof Maschmeyer told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.

In many parts of Asia, fast-growing economies and populations, coupled with huge coastlines and densely populated cities, have filled local seas with trash and plastic waste.

Rubbish collection services and infrastructure have largely failed to keep pace with rapid development.

More than eight million tonnes of plastic are dumped in the world's ocean each year, scientists say - about a truckload per minute. China, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Thailand are among the top culprits, waste experts say.

Aside from the impact this has on human health and wildlife, the 21-strong Apec group has said it costs the region's tourism, fishing and shipping industries about US$1.3 billion a year.

Impoverished Timor-Leste, with a population of just 1.3 million, generates about 70 tonnes of plastic waste each day according to government data, most of which is collected from beaches and urban areas, then burned in the open.

Prof Maschmeyer said the new plant would use chemical technology to quickly turn plastic waste into liquid or gas without adding mineral oil, which no other recycler can do as well.

""The issue with plastic is what you do when you've finished using that product,"" said Prof Maschmeyer, who teaches at the University of Sydney. ""In our case, we can chemically recycle it and put it back into the circular economy.""

Run at no cost to Asia's youngest democracy, all profits will go towards supporting community projects and waste collectors in Timor-Leste, which must first find funding to build the recycling facility.

""This is an exciting collaboration for us,"" said Mr Demetrio do Amaral de Carvalho, Timor-Leste's environment secretary.

""Not only will it make a big difference in plastic waste reduction and reduce harm to our cherished marine life, but Timor-Leste can be an example to the rest of the world,"" he said in a statement.

The same technology is currently planned for other recycling plants in Canada, Australia and Britain.

If successful, Respect will be used as a model for other developing countries suffocating in plastic waste.

""This will be a really valuable programme, not just for the people of Timor-Leste, but also to share the knowledge and technologies to other countries and islands globally,"" said Ms Jo Ruxton, chief executive officer of Plastic Oceans UK, a charity with a plastics focus.",Singapore,2019.05

711,Sustainability solutions,"A workshop 'Turn trash into treasure' on découpage art was recently conducted by Deepika Joshi at park hotel chief guest Chandana Dasari, Zonal Commissioner (West Zone), GHMC.



Deepika is a software professional and founder of 'Ideaovator Solutions Pvt Ltd' and 'Synergy Group' is a social wing and women's group.

She does découpage art which is a Chines art form of decorating an object by gluing coloured paper cutouts onto it in combination with special paint effects, gold leaf and other decorative elements. Commonly, an object like a small box or an item of furniture is covered by cutouts from magazines or from purpose-manufactured papers.

Deepika got this idea two years back she says, ""I thought provoked in 2017 people died due to Ghazipur landfill slide. I started thinking and researching about how to control waste and recycle to protect environment.""

""I have personally seen the Ghazipur landfill which is 60-65 Mts high. It is all man made, so when we made it, we can also control trash by up cycling and recycling. So, I started trying different methods to up-cycles and recycle trash,"" adds 31-year-old Deepika.

She tried herself by ordering the material online, ""I learnt home composting, paper bags, plastic hing pots myself,"" she says. About 'Synergy group' she says, ""It's is a women entrepreneur's group, every enterprise should move towards circular economy and sustainability, we are conducting workshops and creating awareness about circular economy and recycling trash from home and industries. Whereas 'Ideaovator Solutions Pvt Ltd' provide ideas and Business solutions for sustainability.""

She says, ""Challenge was adopting to eco- friendly and biodegradable products. In my case too it became so difficult for me to stop using single plastic or polythene bag. So, I have upcycled whatever it was there at home and started using newspaper and made temporary paper bags for the requirements.""

""Although everyone is aware of pollutants especially plastic it becomes difficult to remove it completely from our lives and adopt to eco- friendly products, which is very challenging for everyone."" She adds. In future Deepika wants to provide innovative sustainable solutions and technology solutions to move towards circular economy.",India,2019.05
783,Are manufacturers the missing link in fashion's circular economy story?,"London’s Oxford Street, New York’s 5th Avenue, Paris’s Champs Elysées, Singapore’s Orchard Road: These iconic destinations are famed for hawking the fashion industry’s latest offerings, but these glitzy retail experiences conceal a deeply unglamorous truth: The fashion industry is a hugely resource-hungry and wasteful one, churning out the equivalent of a garbage truck full of textile waste every second.

The US$1.3 trillion clothing industry, which sustains 300 million jobs from production to retail, takes in about 98 million tonnes of oil, fertiliser, chemicals and dye, and 93 billion cubic metres of water annually.

Experts have cautioned that maintaining status quo has “potentially catastrophic” environmental, and economic consequences, and this warning has been amplified by high-profile activist campaigns calling on fashion to clean up its act.

Some companies have responded with solutions such as apparel made from recycled waste; clothing takeback programmes; and textile recycling innovations. Many are working towards the goal of a circular economy, where clothes and raw materials are used more efficiently, and waste is eliminated.

But while individual innovations are valuable, systems-wide change remains an unfulfilled goal, say observers.

As Kia Jiehui, principal strategist at international sustainability non-profit Forum for the Future says: “There is a gap between the buzz of niche innovations and large-scale solutions that disrupt entrenched wasteful practices in value chains.”

Large manufacturers in brands’ supply chains hold the key to bridging this gap because they are already producing at quality, speed, and volume, she says. “They will therefore be the ones to deliver circular solutions at scale.”

“Apparel brands which are serious about making the fashion industry circular will only be successful if their suppliers see the value of adopting circular practices as well,” adds Kia.

With China, India, Bangladesh and Vietnam among the world’s largest garment exporters, Asia is undoubtedly the beating heart of fashion supply chains, and home to many of the companies which are a crucial part of the effort to make fashion circular.

One such player is Yee Chain International, which is based in Taiwan and has a regional network of factories which make the stretchy, colourful fabrics used in sneakers.

The company’s sustainability officer Martin Su, tells Eco-Business: “We make the equivalent of 48 million pairs of shoes a year. But about 2 million pairs a year are wasted, and that’s a conservative estimate.”

Why does fashion manufacturing have such a huge waste problem, and what are the key obstacles to addressing this? As manufacturers, brands, and sustainability experts see it, the industry’s complex structure, far-flung supply chains, and relentless pace give rise to four key problems:

The fact that clothes are often made, and sold, in completely different and disconnected locations poses a major challenge, says Kia.

“If a product was designed, sampled, mass produced, and sold in a single country, you would have a proper network of physical infrastructure to take back and recycle clothing,” she explains.

“But because the forward supply chain has become so global, the reverse supply chain—that is, getting products back from consumers—is much harder,” she says.

In a few years, manufacturers could turn their attention from markets half a world away to those closer to home as consumption in emerging markets—most noticeably Asia—grows. This could facilitate localised reverse logistics infrastructure, says Kia.

Another obstacle is the unequal power dynamic between manufacturers and their clientele; manufacturers sandwiched between huge raw materials conglomerates and global brands find it hard to say no to customer demands, wasteful as they may be.

Yee Chain’s Su shares that reasons for this wasteful practice can range from capricious designers who have little regard for the supply chain implications of requesting multiple samples to anxiety about meeting increasingly specific consumer tastes.

“At the end of the day, [brands] are the ones who pay the bills and we have to listen to them,” says Su.

Su notes that usually, manufacturers also don’t get access to the right decision makers within their buyer’s company who could help them break these entrenched patterns.

“Suppliers usually work with materials and sourcing teams, and for them, price trumps everything else,” he says. “But maybe the corporate social responsibility or marketing departments would see things differently.”

The breakneck pace of fast fashion also sets up perverse incentives that ignore, or even condone wastage, says Forum’s Kia.

Brands demand that their suppliers deliver on “crazy tight” timelines, and even fine manufacturers for faulty products, says Kia. These dual pressures lead suppliers to resort to overproduction as a way to compensate for manufacturing faults.

Kia observes: “Generating lots of waste is overall less costly than losing business.”

Charging for waste production—as is done in Taiwan—or even a carbon tax, could fix this skewed incentive, suggests Kia.

Yee Chain’s Su notes that manufacturers also stock up to quickly fulfil orders according to what brands forecast, which can be weeks or months before an actual order is placed. “But if the order ends up being smaller, it leads to a lot of wastage.”

Some brands are bucking the trend of this problematic power dynamic.

Swedish fashion giant H&M, for instance, plans to be “100 per cent circular and renewable”, using only recycled or sustainably sourced materials by 2030, and was among the first in the industry to introduce in-store clothing takeback.

Global environment manager for production Harsha Vardhan says H&M invests heavily in technologies like digital sampling and sourcing expertise to minimise over-ordering and over-sampling problems.

H&M realises there are challenges with quality and prices and it is willing to absorb the higher costs in the short-term in order to support suppliers as they switch to circular practices, Vardhan notes.

But even for these brands, some technological challenges remain. For instance, there is just no recycling solution available for materials like acrylic, while clothes made from mixed fibres also pose a costly recycling challenge, says Vardhan.

Other materials are more expensive in their recycled form compared to virgin fibres says Vardhan, adding that more innovation is required to tackle these challenges.

As manufacturers and brands alike acknowledge the scale of fashion’s waste challenge and pursue solutions to make the industry more circular, Forum for the Future has developed the Circular Leap Asia (CLA) initiative to accelerate progress.

The programme brings manufacturers and brands together on a common platform to identify barriers to a circular economy, and pilot-test solutions.

With Forum for the Future acting as a “neutral facilitator”, Kia notes that CLA promotes a more collaborative environment than the standard client-and-vendor dynamic.

For Yee Chain’s Su, a programme like CLA could help manufacturers overcome several challenges.

“A platform for manufacturers and retailers to engage in open dialogue would connect me with the people I need to speak with but don’t have access to, and give me a different position to speak to them from,” he says.

Ultimately, big fashion knows it has to change, and it’s not going to see meaningful results if the suppliers that are the bedrock of the industry can’t have their voices heard or concerns addressed, Kia says.

As H&M’s Vardhan puts it: “As a brand, we cannot set up goals and hope that suppliers will achieve it. We have to enable them through investment and innovation,” he says. “The whole industry has to work together to solve sustainability challenges.”",Singapore,2019.05
788,TCL leads Chinese corporate campaign to recycle discarded appliances - China.org.cn,"Chinese home appliance manufacturers are gearing up to recycle waste household appliances into reusable products, as part of broader push to promote the development of circular economy.



TCL Corp has ramped up efforts to recycle waste products through offline recycling companies and online services.

The Huizhou, Guangdong province-based company has set up two recycling companies, including TCL-Aobo Environmental Protection and Development Co Ltd in Tianjin and TCL-Deqing Environmental Protection and Development Co Ltd in Shantou, South China's Guangdong province.

According to TCL, the two companies could meet the demands of disposal and disassembly of waste home appliances in both North and South China. The company has created a unique model of circular economy, becoming the first domestic enterprise to be engaged in the circular industrial chain of household appliances.

""Green circular economy has always been the philosophy that we adhered to, and home appliance recycling is a vital part of TCL's green industrial chain,"" said Wang Chunlin, general manager of TCL-Aobo.

""Discarded household appliances have great value in recycling. Green recycling will become the core competence of TCL in the future,"" Wang said.

According to Wang, waste televisions, refrigerators and computers are usually sent to dismantling factories, where, after crushing, sorting and chemical refining, materials like plastics, glass, iron and copper are extracted.

TCL-Deqing is in charge of recycling and dismantling home appliances collected from six cities in eastern Guangdong province. In 2018, the company had carried out recycling work of used household appliances with 82 enterprises and institutions in Guangdong.

The two companies owned by TCL recycled more than 3.2 million units of waste home appliances last year, with its total weight reaching over 95,000 metric tons.

Founded in 1981, TCL has grown into a multinational in smart product manufacturing and internet application services.

Data from the China Resource Recycling Association showed that in recent years, the number of discarded home appliances maintained a 20-percent annual growth rate. It is expected that the figure will reach 137 million units in 2020.

Apart from establishing offline recycling company, TCL is exploring new recycling methods, helping improve recycling efficiency, as well as establish a global recycling system.

In 2018, TCL also developed the internet-plus recycling model, and established recycling transit stations through cooperation with Chinese internet giant Baidu Inc.

Shifendaojia, an online home services platform incubated by TCL, which is also a major after-sales service company, provides recycling, repair, cleaning, distribution and installation of home appliances, the repair and recycling of smartphones, and extended warranty and other services.

Skyworth Group Co Ltd and the China Video Industry Association launched a campaign to eliminate old home appliances and replace them with new ones.

The campaign responds to the supply-side reform and consumption upgrade policy of the government.

Skyworth said it is an innovative project as the problem of the televisions exceeding their service time is very serious, and through the replacement of high-quality products, consumers can enjoy enhanced experiences.

Liu Buchen, an independent researcher in the home appliances sector, said that at present, the country's recycling system has made great progress, but public awareness has not kept up with that, and there are still a large number of waste home appliances that have not entered regular recycling channels.",China,2019.05

804,ADB leads ocean clean-up,"The Asian Development Bank (ADB) launched a US$5 billion (160 billion baht) healthy oceans action plan for Asia-Pacific on May 2 at its 52nd annual board of governors meeting.

The Action Plan for Healthy Oceans and Sustainable Blue Economies will expand financing and technical assistance for ocean health and marine economy projects, both public and private, to $5 billion from 2019 to 2024.

""Climate change, unsustainable fishing, increasing uncontrollable coastal development and pollution are threatening not only our ocean but also our prosperity and sustainability of development in our region,"" said Bambang Susantono, the ADB's vice-president for knowledge management and sustainable development.

""There is no time to waste,"" he said. ""We must restore and protect our ocean now. ADB has been tackling upstream-to-downstream problems, but we can and must do much, much more.""

As part of the action plan, the lender will launch the Oceans Financing Initiative to create opportunities for the private sector to invest in bankable projects, such as sustainable tourism and fisheries.

The initiative will provide technical assistance grants and funding from the ADB and other donors to reduce the technical and financial risk of projects. This will be done through instruments such as risk guarantees and capital market ""blue bonds"", said Bruce Dunn, the ADB's director of sustainable development and climate change.

""One of the challenges we face is a chronic lack of sustainable investment in ocean economies,"" he said. ""The Oceans Financing Initiative intends to crowd-finance from different sources, including ADB, and collaborate with the private sector so we can scale our investments.""

The ADB has already invested $2 billion to combat pollution in the ocean across a wide range. The action plan aims to scale up the progress over the next six years, Mr Dunn said.

The ADB will be leveraging its existing cooperation programmes to enhance them, such as projects in wastewater treatment that have been funded heavily.

But solid waste, the circular economy and what Asia can do in recycling have not received enough attention, Mr Dunn said, and there is not enough demand from country partners for these schemes, so the ADB wants to stimulate demand by looking at new types of investments and technologies.

""Many countries claim to be committed to recycling and keeping oceans healthy, but in practice it is not happening,"" he said.

Mr Dunn said the initiative will utilise a whole range of innovative financing tools such as blue investment bonds, which provide credit lines to businesses or the public sector to more effectively invest in restoring or protecting the ocean. He said partners of the initiative will be announced later this week.

""Looking to the private sector, we will be exploring opportunities for equity investments, financial guarantees and blue bonds where we can raise capital from the market for investment,"" Mr Dunn said. ""For the public sector, we will work with our developing member countries and talk with governments on how to best fit ADB's strategy with their priorities.""

The bank is preparing a new regional technical assistance project to tackle marine plastics and debris, with a particular focus on Asean because ""that is where many of the problems are"", he said.

The initiative will focus on four areas: creating inclusive livelihoods and business opportunities in sustainable tourism and fisheries; protecting and restoring coastal and marine ecosystems and key rivers; reducing land-based sources of marine pollution such as plastics, wastewater and agriculture runoff; and improving sustainability in port and coastal infrastructure development.

Mr Dunn said these carrot approaches should help encourage public and private investment to protect the ocean, though stick tactics could also work to stop major polluters. But the latter must be done by governments via regulations and enforcement, not by the ADB, he said.

The ocean feeds 3 billion people worldwide and provides jobs for a billion. Each year it adds $2.3 trillion to the global economy.

Asia-Pacific is home to three-quarters of the world's coral reefs and half of its total biodiversity. The region accounts for the majority of world aquaculture and fisheries, about 80% and 60% respectively, while demand for seafood is expected to rise as the global population grows.

Asia-Pacific is projected to see the highest rise in tourism, especially in coastal areas, in the coming years, but the region is the epicentre of a major crisis in marine plastic pollution, with eight of the 10 rivers transporting 88-95% of plastics into the sea worldwide.

Unless immediate action is taken, 90% of Asia-Pacific's coral reefs will be dead by 2050 and all commercially exploitable fish stocks will disappear by then, the ADB said.",Thailand,2019.05
805,European leaders call for change at State of the Union conference in Italy - Xinhua | English.news.cn,"ROME, May 3 (Xinhua) -- European heads of government, ministers, commissioners and political experts gathered in Florence, Italy, for the 9th annual State of the Union conference on Friday.

Titled ""21st-century Democracy in Europe"", the conference explored democracy and European Parliament elections to be held at the end of the month, the rule of law and the legal powers of the EU, disinformation and fake news, immigration, the next generation of EU citizens, and the single market.

Among the high-level speakers on Friday was Italian Foreign Minister Enzo Moavero Milanesi. He reviewed the achievements of the EU in creating prosperity and stability and keeping the peace in Europe for its over 500,000 citizens, and painted a picture of what he sees for its future, namely, a European federation.

European integration generated ""a feeling of European affiliation"" that is not ""that false feeling of supremacy which for centuries accompanied Europeans"" but rather ""the birth of a spontaneous European identity: everyone who lives within the European space naturally and simply assimilates that feeling"", he said.

""Everyone who has come to Europe or been born in Europe after the 1970s has a radically different vision compared to those from preceding generations,"" he added. ""They don't see citizens of other European countries as real or potential enemies.""

""Even those who criticize and are skeptical of the Union develop European ways of thinking,"" Moavero Milanesi said.

According to GlobalStat data released by conference organizers, 70 percent of European respondents in 2018 said they see themselves as European citizens, compared to 62 percent in 2010.

The minister also cited Eurobarometer data showing that ""seven in 10 Europeans declare they are enthusiastically in favor of the free circulation of people, and believe we should preserve the free circulation of goods and services.""

However, the EU needs to make some changes if it is to survive, the minister said.

The current system doesn't allow Europe to fully and successfully enter into the globalization process, he said. The continent is slipping in terms of the ability to develop new technologies.

Europe has been slow to tackle issues such as migration, and Moavero Milanesi cited more Eurobarometer data showing that 50 percent of respondents identify migration as a big issue, another 50 percent focus on economic growth and youth unemployment, and a good 40 percent is concerned with the threat of international terrorism and security, and the possible consequences of climate change.

The minister made several proposals for a stronger, more inclusive Europe: endowing the European Parliament with lawmaking powers, giving the Union powers to issue eurobonds and to levy European taxes on big economic players such as multinationals, giving Europe a common stance on migration, asylum, and border control, and changing the current rule that foreign and defense policy decisions must be unanimous.

""I think we could ask governments to agree among themselves on a pact that foreign policy decisions should be taken on a majority basis,"" he said. ""It's revolutionary but it's feasible.""

""Clarity of objectives is essential to maintaining citizen consensus,"" Moavero Milanesi said. ""The architecture of the EU must be simplified and completed, and brought closer to citizens"" with the ultimate goal of achieving true federalism, he said.

Also on hand was French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, who delivered a high-level address on behalf of French President Emmanuel Macron and the French government in which he called for ""a new European Renaissance""

""Europe is at a crossroads,"" said Le Drian. ""The real dividing lines between those who wish to stop Europe and those who wish to make it advance will come out into the open (at the upcoming European Parliament elections).""

The French minister went on to list potentially fatal threats to the EU: that of division and what he described as ""the ill winds"" that fan the flames of populism and are ""calling into question the values of the rule of law.""

""As we learn our lesson from Brexit, we should consider the increase of populisms in Europe for what it is -- a symptom of a deep malaise over the distance between institutions and citizens, over globalization, which affects our people in full force, over inequalities within and between our societies and yes, the threats of terrorism, the spectre of trade war and the prospect of a climate catastrophe,"" Le Drian said.

""It is not too late to act, as long as we are aware of these dangers,"" he said. ""The lessons of the British withdrawal should not be a signal of alarm condemning us to repeat past errors and allowing the bonds between us to be broken.""

Like his Italian counterpart, Le Drian called for a consolidated border policy, a European asylum bureau, and a return to ""the fundamentals of the European project"" based on social progress and ""a real social shield -- a minimum threshold for protection to the benefit of workers and all European citizens"".

In his conference closing address, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said that ""Europe must rethink itself.""

""In recent years, Europe has abdicated its fundamental role of representation and failed to intercept the needs, hopes and fears of its citizens,"" said Conte, who leads a populist-rightwing coalition government.

""It has been perceived as oligarchic and out of touch with the real lives of citizens, while social and economic in-qualities have excluded parts of the population, exacerbating feelings of abandonment and loss, especially in the younger generations,"" Conte said.

""Europe must urgently take courageous steps to change course from the current path, which has proven to be a failure.""

Like Moavero Milanesi, Conte called for giving more powers to the European Parliament as a way to ""finally overcome the idea that European policies are being decided by remote bureaucrats in inaccessible places"".

Conte went on to call for European salaries and unemployment protections, investments in the circular economy to fight climate change, and a change in EU competition rules in order to allow state aid to ailing national companies.

Taking place ahead of the May 23-26 elections in which European citizens will choose their representatives in the European Parliament, this edition of the State of the Union also featured a debate amongst the lead candidates for the position of President of the European Commission, which was broadcast across the continent.

860,'Say yes to less waste',"THIS WEEK'S TOPIC: How may the private sector do its part to reduce plastic/other pollution in the oceans? What incentives or other measures could help in combating the problem?

BUSINESS must make more visible and continuous efforts to develop the circular economy. Employees should be rewarded for showing how they can contribute to this.

Examples of business extravagance include failing to make use of cloud storage, insisting on paper when virtual will do and misunderstanding the uses and potential of passwords to facilitate the digitisation of communications and systems. A heavy tax on plastic and paper would make the problems of pollution and waste clear to users. Businesses should be responsible for running weekend clean-up parties and modestly rewarding their employees to recover plastic waste on land and sea. ""What you do is the example you set.""

REDUCING pollution and waste is everyone's responsibility. It starts with businesses redesigning products and minimising packaging so that they are recyclable. Consumers need to make informed choices about what they buy. Each household needs to embrace recycling. These actions are underpinned by all municipalities having rubbish collection, recycling capabilities and waste disposal processes in place to prevent plastics ending up in rivers and flowing into our oceans.

Tax incentives to encourage research in recyclable products and packaging and financing for infrastructure projects for waste collection, recycling and disposal would help. Our survival and that of future generations is at stake.

AT Henkel, we believe that solving the plastic issue is a joint responsibility. That's why we are actively engaged in several partnerships aiming to drive progress towards a circular economy. They include our participation in the New Plastics Economy initiative, cooperation with Plastic Bank and founding membership in the Alliance to End Plastic Waste. We've also set ourselves ambitious targets for sustainable packaging. For example, by 2025, 100 per cent of Henkel's packaging will be recyclable, reusable or compostable.

Globally, we train our employees as Sustainability Ambassadors and engage them to drive sustainability along the entire value chain. In Singapore, our employees have participated in marine debris sample collection and various coastal and waterways cleanup efforts. This year, we will also rally our employees to participate in Henkel's global coastal waste collection initiative. By joining forces, we can make an impact and protect our environment.

TO address the issue of plastic pollution, a sustained, concerted and decisive effort among industry players, government agencies and the community is required. At NTUC FairPrice, sustainability is one of four pillars under our overall CSR commitments.

Amongst other things, we continue to take affirmative actions to reduce plastic bag use through a comprehensive framework that encompasses the efforts of like-minded partners, while also incorporating sustainability initiatives that take into consideration consumer needs and practices of our operations. We encourage the community to join us and be responsible by taking a first step to use less plastic bags so that we may collectively create a more sustainable environment.

THERE is a moral obligation for the private sector to conduct business responsibly, above anything else. All stakeholders must continue to work on developing alternative substrates to plastic, design and implement return and reuse systems, and focus at the same time on cleaning up polluted waterways and oceans.

However, the stick may work just as effectively as the carrot, so a robust regulatory framework and the imposition of stiff penalties are also required to drive necessary change in lifestyle and habits.

THE private sector can do its part to reduce pollution by minimising the amount of plastic generated at source, increasing the collection of plastics and reducing post-collection leakages. At PwC, we manage our own environmental impact and beyond through reducing our own use of plastics as well as participating in volunteering efforts to clean our beaches.

Forward-looking companies have started integrating circular economy principles into their operations like re-designing products and using new materials that facilitate end-of-life recycling. Measures such as extended producer responsibility (EPR) systems, advanced disposal levies to product bans and dumping fines can also help combat pollution.

THE majority of industrial processes produce wastewater that contaminates oceans/surface water and increases landfill wastes, upending the delicate balance of marine ecosystems and irreversibly damaging water bodies. Business leaders can champion conservation efforts in their own fields through the adoption of innovative wastewater treatment technologies, creating a circular economy where usable resources are extracted from wastewater and reinvested into industrial processes.

This vastly reduces not only the environmental footprint but also decreases operating costs in the long run. Challenges to implementation involve high upfront investment, which can be mitigated by not only technological innovation but also by a creative business model (such as one in which the water treatment company owns, operates, and maintains the infrastructure).

THERE are a multitude of ways the advertising industry can help and raising awareness by visualisation is one of the most powerful means. GREY Malaysia's Unforgettable Bag' a Cannes Lions Award-winning campaign for Tesco (which encouraged customers to embrace reusable bags) not only raised awareness globally but contributed to behavioural change. The same with the agency's ""Plastic Diet"" campaign for WWF, which drew worldwide media attention to the volume of plastic people inadvertently consume.

Even at a local level one can take meaningful action, GREY Singapore staff recently volunteered to do a Changi Beach clean-up. This helps to protect the environment as well as give back to the community.

At a global level, one can take WPP as an example. It recently took the word ""plastic"" out of its name - Wire & Plastic Products - and has committed to phasing out single-use plastics in all of its 3,000-plus agency offices and campuses worldwide by 2020. It has also signed the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment and pledged to work with clients and partners to drive change.

The advertising world can lead when it comes to championing waste-free living. It has the commitment, and the communications expertise to help make plastic pollution a priority for people. By collaborating at scale, it can make an even more discernible difference.

TACKLING the issue of plastic pollution needs immediate and urgent attention, and the public and private sectors need to work together to achieve this goal. While governments are laying the important groundwork and taking affirmative actions through policy-making and public awareness campaigns, the private sector can contribute technology expertise and innovative solutions to help build a resource-efficient future.

An example is IGES' patented and commercially-proven technology that converts end-of-life plastics destined for landfill into road-ready fuels that require no further processing, blending or refining. This technology offers a sustainable solution to reduce plastic pollution and deliver lasting positive impact to governments and local communities to create a cleaner planet for the next generation.

ACCORDING to the National Environment Agency, in 2017 only 6 per cent of the 815,200 tonnes of plastic waste generated was recycled. The issue of waste management and reduction, but also recycling and recovery, are major challenges for all humanity in terms of both resources and the environment.

By leveraging data collection and analysis, the waste industry can help to reduce these challenges through better management decision making. Real-time logistics flow management with better adapted collection routes, waste recovery where waste becomes secondary raw material for industrials, transfer of non-recyclable common waste to incineration plants to produce energy or to storage centres that capture the biogas produced by the fermentation of organic waste are a few methods.

In the waste management sector, data-driven strategy is certainly in its early stages; however, there are certainly opportunities to use data to improve planning, efficiency levels and recycling efforts.

PLASTICS are efficient materials that can save resources and offer convenience for society. They become a problem when they are not managed or disposed properly and end up in the environment. As one of the world's leading chemical companies, BASF is engaged in reinforcing responsible handling of plastics, including promotion of solutions contributing to a circular economy.

The global Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW), an alliance of some 30 companies including BASF, will drive solutions to solve the world's plastic waste problem. The alliance will work with governments, academia, non-government organisations and civil society to invest in joint projects to eliminate plastic waste from the environment.

THE greatest hope is in educating our youth on the environmental impact of every decision they make. This is where the private sector can contribute, by working together with schools and youth groups on programmes that will raise awareness of pollution and other environmental issues.

The children of today will play a significant role in shaping the future we want. From a young age, children can form lifelong habits to reduce the use of plastics and carry reusable food containers and water bottles. Children can also take away what they learn to influence their family members to recycle and dispose of waste in responsible ways.

WE can make the most meaningful difference with the greatest positive impact on the planet and its people - if corporations leverage on their global scale. At Mondelez International, we reduce our environmental impact by using less energy, water and waste, and commit globally to make all packaging recyclable by 2025, all paper-based packaging sourced sustainably by 2020, and minimising our overall food waste.

As of this year, we are proud to have removed 65 million kilogram of packaging material, as one of the many steps towards leading the future of snacking sustainably.

FOR starters, the dozens of private sector events held each week can adopt environmentally friendly steps as prescribed by the Sustainable Singapore Movement.

We did just that at the inaugural RHT Rajan Menon Foundation GAIL Sustainability Day last week. Participants at the sustainability forum, held at green event space Sentosa Golf Club, were encouraged to return their lanyards and plastic ID cases at the end of the event for re-use. This is a small step in the right direction.

The government could consider giving private companies tax breaks to conduct sustainability audits to review their operations, find ways to improve and adopt the right practices to reduce waste and use resources more efficiently.

POLLUTION can be caused by overproduction as well as lack of controls and policing at the government level. There are no easy solutions for the challenge posed by plastic pollution. However, emerging technologies, such as AI, can help the private sector do its part. Advanced Analytics can be leveraged along the supply chain to reduce wastage - by accurately predicting consumption, we can avoid overproduction.

Similarly, AI algorithms can help climate scientists understand natural systems and forecast patterns, helping to identify effective interventions, as well as facilitating enhanced coordination among researchers to share and analyse key data on pollution. Data analytics could also contribute to tackling marine pollution by using satellite imaging to locate and track ocean trash. Using analytics in this way, the private sector can gain a business advantage to sell to environment-conscious consumers.

TO put things right in our oceans, we need to rethink entire industries. Organisations need to look in-depth at every aspect of how they operate, from product innovation to waste management, from third-party suppliers to ownership models.

As a wealth manager, Lombard Odier believes that companies with sustainable business practices, financial models and business models will drive excess investment returns, and this is what we convey to our clients. Demand is perhaps the strongest force for change. At a time when investors demand sustainable investment products, and the security of supply and cost of raw materials are weighing on industrial companies' results and prospects, we believe it is intuitive for businesses to consider the lasting consequences of their actions, including rethinking ways to reduce waste and manage pollution.

MANY in Singapore may say, ""We do not dump our plastic waste. We change our trash to ash."" True. But is it sustainable without legions of foreign workers? Or ample landfills for the ash? We need to tackle the root cause of reducing plastic waste at source. Companies that use plastics have a pivotal role to play. They can help nudge consumers from a throwaway culture by removing single-use plastics.

Promoting recycling is another avenue. Our plastic waste recycling rate is only 4 per cent. Compared to the 20 per cent world average, we have a long way to go. Reducing packaging waste is yet another area. The Singapore Packaging Agreement initiative for companies to reduce such waste is a good, albeit, voluntary move. Ultimately, long lasting change is driven by legislation and good policy intervention.

Targets need to be set for companies to reach in their use and disposal of plastics. To spur innovation in reducing, recycling and disposing plastic waste, the government should also sponsor research through grants from the National Research Foundation. Hopefully then, we will become a shining example of a ""zero waste"" nation.

WITH the spotlight on growing environmental concerns around plastic waste, corporations are paying more attention as industry and consumers demand environmentally friendly products. At Dell Technologies, our entrepreneurial spirit drives us to innovate and advance sustainability initiatives, and we intercept ocean-bound plastics to repurpose them, collaborating with many other organisations to scale up the adoption of best practices in preventing plastics from reaching our oceans.

One way to combat the problem is to apply a creative focus on sustainability for products and services. For instance, the concept of a circular economy drives much of our sourcing and design, and we strive to use, and reuse, materials responsibly, with 94 per cent of weight of packaging made from renewable or recyclable materials. Besides pioneering the use of recycled content, we also developed new processes with our suppliers to close the recycling loop on various materials, such as creating ink from diesel emissions in India.

We're huge advocates for the circular economy model and believe that harnessing technology can help drive positive environmental changes, and eventually, human progress.

ThE private sector needs to support the acceleration of corporate stewardship. As one of the fastest-growing hospitality companies in the Asia-Pacific, Hilton is committed through our Travel with Purpose Strategy, which aims to uphold our responsibility to the environment to ensure sustainable travel and tourism for the next generation.

In accelerating corporate stewardship, we have encouraged our team members to be part of the solution. With their support, Hilton has banned plastic straws and eliminated plastic water bottles from our meetings and events. Together, we are piloting plastic alternatives with suppliers and partnering on campaigns such as NEA's ""Say Yes to Less Waste"" to build awareness.

THE private sector has made strides in embracing the economic model of a circular economy that designs out waste and pollution, keeps materials in use for as long as possible and recovers waste, using it as a resource for production.

Given that the ocean makes up 71 per cent of Earth's surface, no one can solve the problem of plastic pollution alone. Private firms can do their part to fuel global change through the phasing out of or stricter regulation of plastic products.

There should also be more effort put towards recovering waste products through innovative sustainable solutions, whether through strategic partnerships or the uptake of technology. There is significant financial opportunity in the downstream of a circular economy, and this is where the business motivator lies.

BUSINESSES today have an important role in reducing carbon footprint. As good corporate citizens, we should work with all the stakeholders to drive change and set targets beyond the minimum requirements. At KONE, we strive to be a global leader in sustainability. One way is through increasing energy and resource efficiency as we envision making sustainable offerings a reality.

Our innovation efforts are focused in contributing to the circular economy and delivering solutions that urban populations truly need. We work closely with our suppliers in selecting materials that are environmentally friendly and recyclable to develop products with long lifetime and modularity.

TODAY'S consumers are increasingly placing importance on a brand's sustainability practices in their purchasing decisions. However, more needs to be done to bring awareness of the risks of ocean pollution into the heart of public consciousness. Here at Dentsu Aegis Network, Dentsu Singapore and

Green is the New Black launched a Plastic Salt campaign using miniature 3D printed salt grinders, to bring to light how microplastic pollution is not just in our oceans but has made its way into our lives, and into the food we eat. Alongside the plastic salt video for World Earth Day, we are also educating young people in Singapore on the impact of plastic pollution in our school outreach programme The Code. We are reaching 400 students and donating 500 hours back to schools in Singapore in July as part of this programme.

Businesses should recognise their responsibility as industry leaders and actively champion for solutions to mitigate their environment impact across all levels. Whether it is in adopting conscious waste management practices internally, or collaborating with customers and industry partners to build a waste-free future.

At Sealed Air, we are in business to protect and to solve critical packaging challenges, and to leave our world better than we found it. Sustainability needs to be part of a business' commitment. For instance, Sealed Air has pledged to deliver 100 per cent recyclable or reusable packaging offerings, and 50 per cent average recycled content across all solutions by 2025. We urge businesses to collaborate for change and focus on collective action to influence and drive positive environmental impact across the value chain.

AS a global thought leader in Green IT, Basis Bay believes a balanced world is possible where the welfare of people and care for our planet is central to the way we think and act.

With sustainability in mind, Basis Bay has developed a holistic approach to Green IT as a corporate philosophy engaging all stakeholders. This comprehensive framework includes enabling IT solutions that ensures efficiency and caring for an organisation throughout their lifecycles in a way that assures resources are utilised and appreciated with minimum wastage and impact to the environment.

Our solutions in themselves have been green for decades and we make it a commitment to constantly look for the best ways to provide sustainable IT solutions from designing, sourcing, and usage.

Organisations should be incentivised and encouraged to procure services and products from organisations ""like ours"" that have green offerings or truly adopt green practices. Keep in mind such offerings will eventually (if not already) cost less to procure as we create an efficient sustainable business ecosystem that is kinder to the environment.

BUSINESSES should proactively find ways to minimise the environmental impact at every part of their operation, especially around non-essential plastic packaging and single-use plastics, which can significantly reduce the volume of plastic waste that might end up in the oceans.

Reducing plastic pollution effectively requires solutions that are both supply and demand-led - curbing the reliance on plastics while encouraging consumers to explore more environmentally-friendly options. In Singapore, these efforts have been largely led by the private sector. To drive a more powerful shift in mindset and behaviour, the government can consider introducing a tax or a gradually-increasing cap on the use of plastics.

In addition, they can also incentivise businesses to adopt technological solutions and reward organisational efforts towards a non-plastic and environmentally sustainable future.

CONSUMERS today are overly dependent on plastics for their convenience. That it fits nicely with the prevalent throwaway mentality appeals to many. It will take a long time to change this over-dependency.

Businesses can do more to change this ingrained habit and tackle this plastic scourge by recycling more and using more bio-degenerating matters. Tackling this problem at source is not only vital but urgent to rein in the problem of marine debris, particularly plastic pollution in the oceans.

The criticality of the problem warrants both incentives and dis-incentives. The government may now want to consider imposing a plastics tax. Both businesses and consumers should be taxed for the use of plastics. However, on the flip side, when businesses and consumers recycle, tax credits can be given to offset the tax.

In the meantime, government, businesses and civic groups should continue collaboratively to intensify public education to create greater awareness of the looming plastic scourge, to reduce the use of plastics and to promote recycling.

IT'S mainly about encouraging businesses to innovate in their supply chain. By doing so, it's important to take into account the overall CO2 point balance while working on the three Rs: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.

Interconnected supply chains call for collaboration across businesses and public-private sectors. Technology platforms come into play, for instance reusable packaging logistics.

I believe in incentive-based policies, such as long-term low interest loans. They have been significant for several decades to finance investments into our environmental initiatives , eg reusable packaging, reduction of water usage, thermal power plant.

BUSINESS leaders need to embrace a circular economy within their organisations to reduce waste and allow for better use of resources. We have a ""throw away"" culture and not much thought is given to what happens after a product is consumed.

Many consumers throw away because there are not enough safe or practical options available to repair, reuse, recycle or upcycle.

Governments need to start at the source and take responsibility for the amount of waste produced within their own countries. We know taxes and incentives can push organisations to redesign and produce responsibly at source. The bigger question is why have governments allowed it to become such a huge problem in the first place?

PLASTICS pollution lies in the profligate use of the synthetic polymer and despite its usefulness, they are not biodegradable as these are unnatural products not found in nature with no bacteria available to decompose them.

They pollute the environment at a staggering rate and are killing wildlife. Over time, plastics choke our whole global eco-system until certain bacteria strains can be cultivated and bred to decompose these plastic.

The private sector alone cannot combat such uses. It has to be a global concerted effort by governments to cease the production and use of such non bio-degradable polymer and to replace with biodegradable substitutes. Government can start to tax the use of avoidable plastics to discourage usage and to shift consumers' behaviors to use less plastics to more sustainable materials.

NO doubt each private sector entity is taking steps to reduce plastic waste. We as an organisation have completely removed single-use plastics as an office policy, and moved to sustainable and recyclable product packaging.

The critical issue is education, awareness and creating consciousness throughout organisations. The concept of a ""circular economy"" and even reverse logistics where transit is used both ways to reduce pollutants and maximise sustainability, is fast becoming the approach to be adopted. Private sector collaborations in the form of shared understandings, resources and partnerships like ZeroWaste SG or initiatives led by the Singapore Environment Council will ensure the problem is combated but in a sustainable and effective manner.

REDUCING pollution in the ocean is a tricky issue as it requires the full coordinated effort from various interest groups, from plastic makers to recyclers, companies and consumers.

Product packaging should be re-evaluated either by reducing plastic usage or changing to an alternative material without affecting the product application. Using JuzTalent, our in-house HRIS solution as an example, it is created to improve the scalability of HR administrative tasks and concurrently eliminate paper usage.

This issue requires both a bottom-up and top-down approach. Governments should impose heavy fines on companies/recyclers that deposit waste material into the ocean. At the same time, with the power of social media, unsightly images of sea animals being suffocated by plastics should be widely shared. This will create more awareness and concern in consumers and hopefully result in fewer purchases in single-use plastic products or of unfriendly environmentally-unfriendly brands.

RECYCLING and reducing the environmental impact is a global challenge and it starts from within the organisation. At Alstom, we strive to reduce energy intensity through ongoing energy action plans and recycle 88 per cent of our waste; we also monitor strictly our air and water emissions.

This also translates to our solutions for sustainable transport. Alstom's comprehensive eco-design policy prioritises using clean, recyclable, and natural materials, reducing noise and vibrations as well as air emissions, and handling the end-of-life management of products - particularly in maintenance activities. The environmental impact of these vehicles is minimised through increased energy efficiency achieved by the use of innovations such as electrical braking, sensor-based air-conditioning, and non-hazardous materials for construction. It is in these initiatives and innovations that we strive to provide a greener environment.

WATER is an important precious natural resource. A multi–prong approach is necessary to address the declining quality of our oceans and environmental contamination from industrial and domestic sources has serious implications.

Among the sources of marine pollution, plastic debris is one of the most common but also challenging to manage. To curb plastic pollution, apart from possible direct regulation through legislation, adoption of innovative water treatment technologies and proper treatment / recycling of hazardous waste is essential. Some form of economic incentives to influence behavioural change will also help.

The real estate industry can play a key role in combating marine pollution. Developers can ensure that their projects give priority to efficient water and waste management with a focus on the health and well-being of occupants and adoption of eco-friendly practices to reduce carbon footprint. Developers can join hands with the government and industry partners to create greater public awareness, encourage public participation in clean-up campaigns, and collectively identify pollution sources and implement remedial measures.",Singapore,2019.06
862,China releases new industry catalogue encouraging foreign investment - Xinhua | English.news.cn,"BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the Ministry of Commerce on Sunday jointly released a revised catalogue of industries that encourage foreign investment.

The catalogue includes an industry catalogue for encouraging foreign investment nationwide and a catalogue of advantageous industries for foreign investment in the country's central, western and northeastern regions.

It is expected to give better play to the positive role of foreign investment in China's industrial development, technological progress and structural optimization, said an official with the NDRC.

The number of listed sectors where foreign investment is encouraged see marked rise. Compared with the 2017 version, the new catalogue for encouraging foreign investment nationwide has 67 newly-added items and 45 modified items, while the catalogue of advantageous industries in central, western and northeastern regions has introduced 54 new items.

Over 80 percent of the newly-added or revised items of the nationwide catalogue point to the manufacturing industry. Foreign investment is more encouraged in sectors such as high-end manufacturing, intelligent manufacturing, and green manufacturing.

New items have been added to encourage foreign investment in 5G core components, etching machines for integrated circuits, chip packaging equipment, and cloud computing equipment.

Besides, new entries have been added for artificial intelligence, clean production, carbon capture and circular economy.

The catalogue for the central and western regions further adds labor-intensive as well as advanced and applicable technology industries and supporting facilities, giving the regions greater support to their embracing of industrial transfer of foreign-funded businesses.

China attracted a record high foreign direct investment (FDI) of 138.3 billion U.S. dollars last year, bucking a global trend of FDI slide. In the first five months of this year, the country saw an FDI inflow of 54.6 billion dollars, up 3.7 percent year on year.",China,2019.06
863,New Zealand's single-use plastic shopping bags ban kicks in - Xinhua | English.news.cn,"WELLINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The ban on single-use plastic shopping bags, which takes effect on Monday, is ""a step towards healthier oceans and giving nature a hand,"" Associate Environment Minister Eugenie Sage said on Sunday.

""New Zealanders are proud of our country's clean, green reputation and want to help ensure we live up to it. Ending the use of single-use plastic shopping bags helps do that,"" Sage said in a statement.

""From tomorrow, 1 July, the ban will cover all retailers,"" she said, adding new regulations mean local businesses can no longer provide their customers with a single-use plastic shopping bag to carry their purchases.

""The ban should ensure less plastic ends up in rivers, streams, stormwater systems and the ocean so seabirds, fish, turtles, and marine mammals are less vulnerable to being harmed by it,"" Sage said.

""At the start of plastic-free July, the plastic shopping bag ban is one step to tackling New Zealand's waste issues,"" she said, adding the government also needs to recharge materials recovery and recycling systems and shift to a circular economy.

New Zealand's mainstream supermarkets have already made the change away from single-use plastic shopping bags and report that this has stopped tens of millions of bags being handed out.

New Zealanders appear to have made a rapid transition to reusable bags, with 56 percent of shoppers in April 2018 bringing reusable bags increasing to 91 percent always, or often, bringing their own reusable bag in September 2018, according to a survey research done for the Ministry for the Environment.

""Lightweight single-use plastic shopping bags pollute nature because they are easily transported by wind and water. The phase-out encourages people to act with nature in mind,"" Sage said.

Businesses were given six months ahead of the ban to phase-out single-use plastic bags. There is an online portal on the ministry's website so people can report businesses that are still giving out single-use plastic bags after the ban takes effect.",China,2019.06
868,"Except US, all G20 nations pledge full commitment to Paris climate deal","Nineteen members of the G20, except the US, on Saturday reaffirmed their commitment to the ""full implementation"" of the Paris climate deal, agreeing to look into a wide range of clean technologies and approaches.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other world leaders attending the G20 summit in the Japanese city of Osaka agreed to a climate change deal similar to that signed in Argentina last year.

As at the 2018 G20 meeting in Buenos Aires, the new declaration said that the US reiterated its decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement ""because it disadvantages American workers and taxpayers.""

The document said the signatories to the Paris Agreement reaffirmed their commitment to its full implementation.

To help achieve climate change prevention, the G20 nations ""will look into a wide range of clean technologies and approaches, including smart cities, ecosystem and community based approaches, nature based solutions and traditional and indigenous knowledge,"" the final document said.

The text maintained a ""similar"" commitment to fight climate change as in previous declarations in Buenos Aires and Hamburg, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said at a press conference at the end of the summit.

""We've succeeded after days and nights of negotiations to have again, after all, a 19 to 1 declaration, where the 19 signatory countries of the Paris agreement commit to the same things as we did in Buenos Aires,"" Merkel was quoted as saying by the Politico.

""We say that this process is 'irreversible' and we say that we have made our commitments [to cut greenhouse gas emissions] and will do a review again in 2020 to see whether we must make new commitments,"" she said.

The leaders discussed urgent problems with pollution, loss of biodiversity and climate change, noting the need for a shift in thinking about financing and the involvement of businesses in innovation and investment in sustainable growth.

But their declaration included a recognition of the US decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on reducing carbon emissions that lead to global warming and noted American progress from 2005 to 2017 in reducing such pollution.

In the light of recent extreme weather events and disasters, the G20 leaders recognised the urgent need for addressing complex and pressing global issues and challenges, including climate change, resource efficiency, air, land, fresh water and marine pollution, including marine plastic litter, biodiversity loss, sustainable consumption and production, urban environmental quality and other environmental issues.

The declaration said that a paradigm shift is needed where the virtuous cycle of environment and growth is accelerated through innovations, and with business communities playing an important role, in synergy with the public sector.

To this end, they stressed the importance of accelerating the virtuous cycle and leading transformations to a resilient, inclusive, and sustainable future.

They emphasised the importance of taking concrete and practical actions and collecting international best practices and wisdom from around the world, mobilizing public and private finance, technology and investment and improving business environments.

They emphasised the importance of providing financial resources to assist developing countries with respect to both mitigation and adaptation in accordance with the Paris Agreement.

They recognised that improving resource efficiency through policies and approaches, such as circular economy, sustainable materials management, the 3Rs(reduce, reuse, recycle) and waste to value, contributes to the SDGs, as well as to addressing a wide range of environmental challenges, enhancing competitiveness and economic growth, managing resources sustainably, and creating jobs.

The G20 leaders reiterated that measures to address marine litter, especially marine plastic litter and microplastics, need to be taken nationally and internationally by all countries in partnership with relevant stakeholders.

871,"British Deputy High Commissioner: ‘UK, India working together for sustainable urban growth’","HYDERABAD: The United Kingdom and India are committed to work together and develop innovative solutions to the challenges faced by cities with the aim of promoting sustainable urban growth.

British Deputy High Commissioner Andrew Fleming stated during his special address at the ""Knowledge Dissemination Workshop"" on Waste Management organised here on Friday.

UK’s expertise is being utilised to solve the pressing issues like solid waste management (smw) in Indian cities as they are growing rapidly.

The SWM project is a part of the wider UK-India engagement in the urban sector, with scope for more mutually beneficial opportunities to partner with the Telangana government in the coming months, Flemming said.

In this regard, the British High Commission has undertaken a programme on ‘Technical Assistance on Waste Management and Circular Economy’, bringing international experts to Hyderabad to share best practices through a series of knowledge exchange workshops.

""UK’s Environment Plan sets out a target of maximising the value and benefits we get from our resources, doubling resource productivity by 2050. Our goal is to work towards eliminating all avoidable waste by 2050 and all avoidable plastic waste by end of 2042. Our ambition is to become a world leader in using resources efficiently and reducing the amount of waste we create as a society,"" he said.

""The UN has predicted that the human population will rise from 7.6 billion to 11.2 billion by the end of the century. This coupled with rising consumption will create relentless demand for materials and fossil fuels and putting unsustainable pressure on the planet's resources. The only way to resolve this is by transitioning from a linear economy, where one can make, use and dispose of, to a regenerative, circular economy, where we reduce, reuse and recycle,"" he said.

880,Circular economy's potential remains unrealised,"The importance and necessity of a circular economy, which means cheaper products and services and reduced congestion and pollution, cannot be overemphasised

At the industrial estate road in Vapi, the hub of paper mills in south Gujarat, there is feverish activity. Lorries carrying imported wastepaper make a beeline. Mountains of trash can be seen heaped inside the mills, ready to be recycled. In what can be considered a golden example of the circular economy model, paper recycling is booming in India, with a surge in the import of wastepaper.

Worldwide, countries are refusing to be dumping grounds of trash, forcing developed economies, which are huge waste generators, to look for alternatives. In 2017, China announced a ban on the import of 24 types of scraps, including paper, applicable from January 1, 2018.

The announcement sent shock waves in the UK, the US and the European Union, which are still trying to find ways to manage their waste. What came as a shocker to the West gave a new lease of life to paper manufacturers in India, many of whom had been struggling due to the shortage of raw materials.

Paper already accounts 50 per cent of all dry waste generated in urban India, followed by plastic (14 per cent), glass (6 per cent), textile (5 per cent), wood (3 per cent), metal (1.5 per cent) and residue (20 per cent), as per a 2011 working paper prepared by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion under the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry. After the Chinese ban, India’s import of wastepaper spiked.

The figure stood at 4 million tonnes in 2017-18, but grew by 23 per cent to around 5 million tonnes between April and December 2018. This increase was just 1.3 per cent in 2015-16 and 2.2 per cent in 2016-17. With abundant supply, wastepaper prices fell by 16 per cent to an average Rs 13.7 per kg in the first half of 2018-19 from Rs 16.3 per kg in the same period previous year.

Wastepaper import is also helping India meet the domestic demand, which rose from 9.3 million tonnes in 2008 to 17.1 million tonnes in 2018, as per the Directorate General of Commercial Inte-lligence and Statistics (DGCIS).

“The waste dumped by Western countries in India is fibre-rich. Here, we have plenty of labour for recycling paper and the cost of production is also low. So, it is a win-win situation,” says Akhilesh Kumar Sharma, a paper technologist and the chief executive officer of Rama Pulp and Papers Ltd based in Vapi.

Recycled paper is used as a raw material in India for manufacturing newsprint, paperboard, duplex kraft paper, note-books, packaging materials and tissue papers. It is also exported to the US and the UK as finished products.

Apart from Vapi, Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh, Baleswar in Odisha, Amritsar in Punjab, Nagpur in Madhya Pradesh, Rajahmundry and Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, and Sathyamanglam in Tamil Nadu are the major wastepaper recycling hubs of the country.

Though things look good right now, the circular economy model of paper recycling poses a risk of importing contaminants and India runs the risk of becoming a dumpyard like China was. “European countries do not conduct any formal sorting due to the lack of cheap labour.

So, paper waste mixed with contaminants like plastic, glass and aluminium gets imported here. Also, while some mills have a proper system to dispose plastic mixed with paper, most just dump it in the surrounding areas, says Sharma.

Import and export of paper, paperboard, and paper product wastes is regulated as per the Hazardous Wastes (Management, Handling and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2008. The rules do not permit contaminants for 31 of the 48 graded of imported wastepaper and up to two per cent contaminants for the remaining. The consignment has to be sent back to the exporting country in case of any violation of the rules. Though there are consignment checks at major ports, the procedures are lax and sometimes the rate of contamination is as high as 10 per cent, say paper manufacturers.

“During custom examination we present documents for clearance. A pre-inspection certification agency should check how much contamination a consignment has. But mostly the cargo is passed without checks,” says Gagan Ahluwalia, founder of Paper Fiber Impex, a Delhi-based wastepaper importing firm. “In China, these consignments go through efficient scanners that check for contamination. Such scanners are hardly available in any Indian port,” he says.





 THE CONCEPT OF reuse is not new to India. The practice of younger siblings wearing clothes worn by elders, and babies being clothed in used garments is common across cultures. Exchanging used cloths for steel utensils when door-to-door vendors come knocking too is quite prevalent. What do these venders do with the clothes they collect? Raghubir Nagar in Delhi houses a market where such clothes are sold.

Considered to be one of Asia’s largest markets for second-hand garments, the day here breaks as early as 3 am for street vendor Karamdas Prakash and his wife Rekha, who sell 50 to 100 clothes daily. The market has some 5,000 vendors engaged in this ancestral business. By 11 am, stillness descends and the market is closed. Post 11 am, Prakash and other vendors sell steel utensils door-to-door in exchange for clothes in different parts of the National Capital Region.

“A considerable number of people cannot afford new clothes. Here, they can get a pair of good jeans in less than Rs 50. It is good that longevity of clothes is being extended this way,” says Prakash.

Over the past 20 years India’s import of used clothes has also risen — from Rs 3.3 crore in 1996-97 to Rs 615.8 crore in 2018-19, as per the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry. In 2017, the top three countries to export used clothes to India were the US (47 per cent), South Korea (18 per cent) and Canada (12 per cent).

Mostly, imported clothes are used as raw material for manufacturing new items. In Panipat, Haryana, there are many industries where yarn extracted from woollens and hosiery is used to make blankets, shawls, curtains and bedsheets. Bulk of these items are bought by international humanitarian agencies and sent to Africa and other countries.

Pritam Singh Sachdeva, president of Northern India Roller Spinners’ Association, says that the turnover of Panipat’s recycling industry stands at Rs 7,000- Rs 8,000 crore from exports and 80 per cent of the business is based on recycled yarn.

Apart from Delhi and Panipat, Kandla in Gujarat is another major hub of used textiles. The Kandla Special Economic Zone is one of India’s largest centres for sorting and grading textile waste.

There are a few sectors of circular economy in India that are yet to pick up pace but have tremendous scope for growth. A 2018 report by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI) says that “half-a-trillion dollars worth of economic value can be unlocked” through circular economy business models by 2030 in India. One such sector is e-waste. The FICCI report says that just extracting gold from e-waste in India can yield $1 billion.

THERE ARE NO government figures for e-waste generated in India, but as per the “Global E-waste Monitor 2017”, a report published by the United Nations University, India generated about 2 million tonnes of e-waste in 2016. However, the country’s e-waste recycling potential is abysmal. As per the Central Pollution Control Board, India’s formal sector could only recycle 0.099 million tonnes e-waste in 2015-16. To improve the country’s e-waste recycling capacity, the government is setting up e-waste recycling units in major cities.

However, informal recycling operations have been in place for a long time, with over 1 million poor people in India involved in manual recycling operations, says the “Global E-waste Monitor 2017”. They, in fact, recycle about 95 per cent of the country’s e-waste, says a 2007 study by Manufacturers’ Association for Information Technology, an association of informationtechnology companies, based in Delhi. Bringing them to the mainstream will not only streamline the way they recycle the hazardous waste, but also help the country realise its e-waste recovery potential.

One of the prerequisites for harnessing the business and economic potential of e-waste is proper inventorisation. This will attract investors to the e-waste recycling industry as they can clearly evaluate the resource recovery potential of materials contained in e-waste.

Scrap plastics and end-of-life-vehicles (ELVs) are the other sectors that can grow massively. The FICCI report says that 40 per cent of plastic waste in India is uncollected and, if properly managed, represents a $2 billion opportunity. The report also says that over 8 million tonnes of steel can be recovered from ELVs in India by 2025, representing a $2.7 billion opportunity.

“A circular economy development path could significantly mitigate negative environmental externalities. For example, greenhouse gas emissions could be 23 per cent lower in 2030 and 44 per cent lower in 2050 compared with the current development scenario, helping India deliver on its targets promised in the recently ratified Paris Agreement,” says a 2016 report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

A circular economy also means cheaper products and services, and reduced congestion and pollution. As such, its importance and necessity cannot be overemphasised.",India,2019.06
895,Why we need a circular economy,"Reusing products is not only necessary for a sustainable future, but also makes business sense

The ""Choose Used"" collection promoted by Hollywood actor Olivia Wilde aims to reduce textile waste. It is available on resale website Thredup

Rwanda has a reason for opposing used clothes. Pushed by flawed trade regimes and myopic policies, these goods have nearly decimated the textile, apparel and leather industries in Africa. But elsewhere, a movement of sorts has gained momentum with celebri ties urging consumers to choose second-hand clothes for a sustainable future.

“The textiles system operates in an almost completely linear way: large amounts of non-renewable resources are extracted to produce clothes that are often used for only a short time, after which the materials are mostly sent to landfill or incinerated,” says a report by UK-based think-tank Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

Globally, clothing production doubled between 2000 and 2015. During the period the number of garments purchased each year increased by 60 per cent but the average number of times a garment was worn before disposal declined by 36 per cent. More than $500 billion worth of natural resources are lost every year due to clothing underutilisation and the lack of recycling, says the report.

The volume and variety of natural resources that end up in landfill due to the take-make-disposal model is immense if one considers the diversification of industrial economy and technological advancements. “Some 65 billion tonnes of raw materials entered the economic system in 2010, and this figure is expected to grow to around 82 billion tonnes in 2020,” says a 2014 report of the World Economic Forum.

Three planet Earths would be required to accommodate the gargantuan waste humanity would produce by 2050, warns environmental group, the World Wide Fund for Nature.

Amid this impending crisis, the idea of circular economy is fast catching up. A paper published in ScienceDirect in August 2018 says in the past five to 10 years, the concept has received significant attention at various levels.

There has been a 50 per cent increase in academic publications on circular economy in the past five years. Worldwide, govern ments, particularly those facing a growing crisis of raw materials, are making the concept an integral part of their policies.

Consider China. The world’s most populous country is among the first to have realised the potential of circular economy as far back as in the 1990s. In 2008, the country adopted the Circular Economy Promotion Law and has established a commission which is responsible for planning and coordination of the circular economy.

It monitors a scheme, Trade Old for Remanufactured, which aims to motivate citizens to recycle and reuse. Under the scheme, customers get 10 per cent discount if they trade their old equipment for remanufactured items. Its 11th five-year plan has been drafted keeping in focus three R’s—reduce, reuse and recycle.

In 2017, the government introduced Circular Economy Policy Port-folio which ensures that manufacturers focus of ecofriendly designs and remain responsible for collecting, transporting, recycling and responsibly disposing of the products at the end of their life.

Japan is the other Asian player which sees circular economy as a mechanism to tide over resource constraints. It processes and reproduces its waste in such way that 98 per cent of the metals get recycled. Even 12 years ago, only five per cent of waste ended up in landfills.

In fact, in 2001, Japan was credited for introducing the first take-back law in the world, which forces retailers and manufacturers to take back used air conditioners, televisions, washing machines and refrigerators.

Under the law, consumers share the responsibility of manufacturers and the government to initiate the take-back process and pay a fee for collection and recycling of products. The law, though appears stringent, makes sense in a country whose volcanic and mountainous terrain offers limited space for landfills.

In Europe, Germany is the leader when it comes to sustainability goals. As per the Circular Economy Index prepared by media house The Politico, Germany recycles 65 per cent of its materials and sends 30 per cent to waste-to-energy plants. Only five per cent goes to landfills. The country, in fact, holds an estimated 1,260 patents that deal with sustainable products, processes and services.

Global bodies like the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) are also promoting circular economy through various events. In 2017, WEF and its partners established the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy, or PACE, to drive action towards a circular economy. Under PACE, over 50 business and government leaders have come together to create favourable conditions for widespread adoption of the concept. However, UNEP urges global leaders and think-tanks to expand the scope of circular economy beyond just recycling products.

It points out that the value-retention processes (VRPs) like remanufacturing, refurbishment, repair, direct reuse and recycling can be complementary. In a report, it points out that VRPs create net-positive outcomes by enabling product-level efficiency gains in materials and energy use, as well as help control emissions and waste generation.

Remanufacturing and comprehensive refurbishment can contribute to reduced emissions by 79 to 99 per cent in many sectors. Remanufacturing can reduce new material requirement by 80 to 98 per cent.

Comprehensive refurbishing saves more materials on an average, and it stands between 82 and 99 per cent. Repair saves an even higher share, between 94 and 99 per cent; and arranging direct reuse largely does not require any inputs of new materials. This can help us save gold, silver, indium, iridium and tungsten which can near depletion very soon.

It now remains to be seen whether countries would see their used products as waste and dump on poorer countries or try to achieve resource efficiency for a sustainable future.",India,2019.06
909,The circular economy: Africa’s historic pivot,"African governments have increasingly been taking a stand on potentially controversial issues, including trade policy, land redistribution and macro-economic and debt-management policies

The year 2018 was marked by tremendous economic and political turbulence around the world. And yet, for future historians, it may well be the year when Africa started to claim its intellectual and economic-policy independence.

The unlikely trigger for what could turn out to be a continent-wide strategic shift was Rwanda’s decision to increase tariffs on imported secondhand clothes and footwear in support of its local garment industry.

This provoked an immediate hostile response from the US, which suspended duty-free status for Rwandan textile exports under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), America’s flagship trade legislation for the continent.

For a small, landlocked African country that relies heavily on trade, this was a big deal. But the fact that Rwanda held its ground confirmed that times have changed. If Rwanda is willing to risk preferential access to the US market in order to develop its domestic garment industry, then it must be confident that it will find alternative markets for its exports.

Meanwhile, other African countries have also adopted a more independent attitude vis-à-vis the major trading powers.

African governments have increasingly been taking a stand on a wide range of potentially controversial issues, including trade policy in East Africa, land redistribution in Southern Africa, and macro-economic and debt-management policies in North Africa.

African governments’ motive for stepping up now is not only economic; it is also about dignity, intellectual freedom, and a willingness to risk charting one’s own course.

And, more broadly, African leaders recognise that the ongoing trans-formation of the global economy means that no country will have enough power to impose its strategic preferences on others, even when they are much smaller, as in the case of Rwanda and the US.

Empirical research from the World Economic Forum (WEF) shows that tariff reductions and market access have become much less relevant for economic growth than was the case a generation ago.

Trade is no longer about manufacturing a product in one country and selling it elsewhere; rather, it is about cooperating across borders and time zones to minimise production costs and maximise market coverage.

The WEF estimates that, “Reducing supply chain barriers to trade could increase [global] GDP up to six times more than removing tariffs.”

If all countries could bring the performance of border administration, together with transport and communications infrastructure, up to just half the level of global best practice, global GDP would grow by $2.6 trillion (4.7 per cent), and total exports would increase by $1.6 trillion (14.5 per cent).

By comparison, the complete elimination of all tariffs worldwide would boost global GDP by only $400 billion (0.7 per cent), and exports by $1.1 trillion (10.1 per cent).

Clearly, global value chains are now the dominant framework for trade. And, as we have seen, African countries such as Rwanda (as well as Ethiopia and Morocco) are already taking advantage of this paradigm shift. Rather than wasting time in unproductive policy discussions over tariffs, they are redirecting their strategies to focus on trade facilitation.

True, today’s trade wars have disrupted international supply chains, and will continue to do so. But new constraints will also stimulate creativity and innovation.

For example, as Meghnad Desai of the London School of Economics points out, “In the light of advances in technologies such as 3D printing and artificial intelligence, it is not far-fetched to imagine that businesses could manufacture domestically the intermediate products that they currently import.”

In this case, trade would continue apace, “but the product mix would shift from intermediate to final products.”

Moreover, in an increasingly multipolar world, low-income countries will not have to rely solely on the West for financing and policy ideas (though they will have to be mindful of the risks of indebtedness and precarious governance frameworks). Even as global commerce has undergone a tectonic shift, traditional development thinking, policies, and practices have not.

Meanwhile, as the major emerging economies pursue technological and industrial development to escape the “middle-income trap,” they are altering the distribution of roles and responsibilities across the global production system.

Owing to the economic success of countries such as China, Vietnam, and Indonesia, other low-income economies in Africa and elsewhere now have substantial opportunities to boost employment in labour-intensive industries.

After all, China now produces many of the high-value-added goods that once were the exclusive preserve of advanced economies.

As China and others continue climbing the industrial and technological ladder, the necessary relocation of large parts of their supply chains to lower-cost countries will affect the costing and pricing of goods and labour everywhere. But developing countries can actually use their latecomer status to reap substantial economic benefits.

Despite the wildly exaggerated threat of automation, African countries, in particular, can exploit their lower factor costs to promote successful labour-intensive industries in which they have a comparative advantage.

For example, African countries can lower the cost of doing business by building strategically located production clusters and industrial parks (including for green industries). They are also in a strong position to attract foreign direct investment, which brings the positive externalities of technology and know-how transfer, managerial best practices, state-of-the-art learning, and access to large global markets.

If managed properly, this two-pronged approach could provide ample employment for a low-skilled labour force, while rapidly increasing fiscal revenues. And this, in turn, would allow for improvements to infrastructure in other areas, thus creating the conditions for long-term prosperity and social stability.

While trade agreements such as the AGOA are still very important to African countries, broader economic and techno-logical changes are opening up new opportunities, and smart policymakers are seizing them. This is a pivotal moment in North-South relations.

After centuries of being politically and intellectually tethered to advanced economies with little to show for it, Africa is striking out on a new path of self-affirmation.

In this quest for prosperity, African leaders and policymakers have proved ready to withstand sanctions, threats, and setbacks. They may not all have read Nietzsche, but they know that what “does not kill us, makes us stronger”.",India,2019.06

939,The circular economy: How Rwanda tries to chart its course in hostile global waters,"Wanting to move away from being a dumpyard of used clothings has meant angering Donald Trump's USA. The small east African country is trying to find a way out

An uneasy silence has enveloped over the once-vibrant Kimironko market in Rwanda’s capital town, Kigali. Sitting in a dim corner, Emmanuel Harindintwari listens intently as the other stallholders discuss an incident on the border that now threatens political and social stability in East Africa.

On May 24, the Rwandan security force gunned down two people, including a Ugandan national, for trying to smuggle used clothes into the country. Those were hand-me-downs from people living some tens of thousands of kilometres away across the North Atlantic Ocean, or beyond the Mediterranean Sea, which get sold across Africa as cheap garments and are the primary source of clothing across the continent.

But the Rwandan government does not want its citizens to sift through piles of cast-offs from wealthier nations. In its attempt to shed the “third world” label and “restore” people’s dignity, the government has been aggressively regulating the entry of used clothes and footwear into the country.

Since 2016-17, it has progressively increased taxes on these merchandise, first from $0.20 to $2.50 per kg and then to $4 in the next financial year. Tariff on used footwear has also jumped from $0.20 to $5. Simultaneously, the government has heightened surveillance along the country’s porous borders with Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, which are among the top importers of used clothing in Africa.

This has unnerved many of the 22,000 Rwandans engaged in the trade—right from wholesalers, retailers and vendors to those involved in washing, repairing and restyling products to fit the body shapes and sizes of Africans.

When asked about his business, Harindintwari points at a less-than-a-metre-wide stall, crowded with neatly folded used trousers, shirts and colourful bedcovers, and says: “These are all legally imported goods. But the raised tariff has made them so pricey that a bale of used clothes now costs $422 compared to $56 two years ago. If we pass this cost on to customers, we risk losing sales. If not, we incur heavy losses.”

Earlier, he recalls, these narrow corridors of Kimironko market used to overflow with discarded garments. Customers used to jostle to pull out a fine T-shirt with a famous logo or a high-fashion western dress. “I made a fortune selling those in the past 20 years. Today, I struggle to arrange money for my child’s school fees.”

Away from the market, on the outskirts of Kigali, Claudette Nyiraneza, a roadside vendor, explains how the tariff has made decent clothes unaffordable for an average Rwandan. “Earlier, one could buy a second-hand garment for 100 Rwandan franc ($0.11). Now, one has to shell out at least Rwf4,000 ($5) for a piece. This is almost a week’s salary for a farm worker or 10 days’ salary for a domestic help,” says Nyiraneza.

According to the World Bank, over 55.5 per cent people in this tiny landlocked country live below the international poverty line of $1.90 a day.





 OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY, the raised tariff on used clothes has rattled the world’s largest economy — the United States. In early 2017, just weeks after Donald Trump was sworn in as the president and the “America first” foreign policy was brought in, a little-known trade association, the Secondary Materials and Recycled Textiles Association (Smart) appealed to the government against the efforts in East Africa to phase out imports of second-hand clothing. It claims the region accounts for one-fifth of the total US exports of used clothes. A ban would cost the US 40,000 jobs and an annual export earning of $147 million.

In response, Trump first issued threats to Rwanda and then suspended its duty-free privileges on domestically made apparel under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). The preferential trade agreement between the US and 44 African countries allows the latter to sell 6,400 goods in the US market without paying import tariffs that most countries must pay and without being subject to import quota restrictions.

Following Trump’s order, the Rwandan government is now losing an estimated $1.5 million a year in export earnings. This is a huge sum for a country that has few natural resources and heavily depends on trade.

But President Kagame has labelled the trade war losses only as “short-term” and his government is adamant on its decision. Leaving behind the shadow of the 1994 genocide, which claimed the lives of 50,000 to 1 million people in just 100 days, the country’s GDP has been steadily growing at an impressive 7 per cent in the past two decades. Today, it is one of Africa’s fastest-growing economies.

The government now aims to transform Rwanda into an upper-middle income country by 2035. The government believes removing cheap used clothing and footwear from the domestic market is the only way to protect its local textile and leather manufacturers from unfair competition, and thereby bolster the country’s economy.

This vision was also at the heart of Rwanda’s neighbouring countries, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and South Sudan, which have in recent years formed the East African Community (EAC) and are emerging as a single market. According to a 2017 report by international non-profit USAID, EAC accounted for 12.5 per cent of the global imports of used clothing, worth $274 million in 2015.

In 2016, led by Kagame who is also the chairperson of EAC, these countries prepared a long-term development strategy, Vision 2050, that required them to strengthen their domestic manufacturing sector. Along with Rwanda, rest of the EAC countries pledged to phase out second-hand clothing by 2019, which they believe has dealt a severe blow to their once-thriving textile and leather industries. 



 Consider Kenya. Between 1960s and early 1980s, import of used clothes was banned in the country and the government promoted domestic production of textile and apparel to meet local consumption as well as to protect its cotton industry from foreign competition. In the 1980s, the country allowed second-hand clothes as donations for refugees from neighbouring countries. This gradually led to trade in the merchandise, shows a research done in 2017 by non-profit CUTS International.



 From the early 1990s, the government lifted the ban on used clothes as it focused on liberalisation and export promotion. By 2000, most of its domestic textile companies in Kenya had collapsed due to, among other factors, increased competition from used clothes.

According to Nairobi-based Kenya Association of Manufacturers, before 1990 the country had 52 textile mills and hundreds of garment companies, making its textile sector the second largest employer after public service. The country, at present, has only 17 players in spinning, weaving, knitting and fabric finishing. Only four of them are fully integrated textile mills.



 Similarly in the late 1960s, Uganda was the largest producer of cotton lint in Sub-Saharan Africa. Most of its produce was consumed locally for producing perfect clothing for the warm, sunny climate. But the market collapsed first due to domestic turmoil in the 1970s and the 1980s and then following economic liberalisation in the 1990s. Today, Uganda produces just a fourth of what it used to produce in the 1970s, shows a 2017 document by the UN Conference on Trade and Development. 



 The dwindling capacity and defunct mills of these countries further increased their dependency on cheap second-hand clothing, creating a vicious cycle. Today, over half the population in Kenya depends on imported cast-offs for affordable clothing. In 2013, the government collected $54 million in tariff revenue on 0.1 million tonnes of imported clothing and the industry employed 65,000 people.

Abel Kamau, head of the Kenya Association of Manufacturers, says his country is a major beneficiary of AGOA. Among EAC nations, it is the largest apparel exporter to the US. In 2017, it exported $410 million worth of goods to the US as compared to $43 million by Rwanda. Small wonder, Kenya was the first EAC country to roll back tariffs on used clothes when Trump threatened it with suspension from AGOA benefits. Tanzania and Uganda, which are among the world’s top 15 importers of used clothes, and Burundi followed suit. 



 What’s worse, these countries have been leaders in raw materials required for the textile industry. Rwanda, for instance, is known for its fine silk. Tanzania is still one of Africa’s top cotton producers. But industry experts say most of the cotton produced in EAC goes to Asia where it is spun, converted into apparel and shipped to the US and EU to be worn for two to three years and then shipped back to EAC as used clothing.



 The EAC region is also endowed with raw materials for footwear. Tanzania has a total of 22.8 million cattle, Kenya 17.5 million, Uganda 12.8 million, Rwanda 0.99 million and Burundi 0.74 million. But these countries can process leather only up to the preliminary wet blue stage, notes the research paper by CUTS International. Some 80 to 90 per cent of the wet blue leather is exported and only 10 per cent is left for processing to finished leather which is then used by artisanal shoemakers. Though there is a significant demand for footwear in the region, 80 per cent of the demand is met through imports out of which 60 per cent are second-hand shoes.

Today, Rwanda Stands alone in implementing import restrictions and in its fight against the US. As part of its drive towards establishing self-reliance in clothing, Rwanda launched the Made in Rwanda campaign in 2016 to mobilise support for local entrepreneurs and artisans as well as to encourage companies to improve garment production quality.

It is also urging traders to shift from used clothing to Made-in-Rwanda clothing. At present, the Rwandan textile industry relies on imported raw materials such as polyester and cotton, making locally produced clothes expensive. Polyester and cotton make up 40 per cent of the raw materials used in textile manufacturing, according to Ritesh Patel, the managing director of Utexrwa, a Kigali-based textile industry functioning since 1985. “This reliance makes local garments uncomp etitive in the market. A shirt made by Utexrwa sells for $5 in the market, which is still expensive compared to second-hand shirts,” Patel admits.

In a bid to reduce the cost of production, the Private Sector Federation (PSF) of Rwanda, dedicated to promote the interests of the business community, is encouraging collective investments in the textile industry. “We have put the manufacturers together when it comes to importing raw materials. When they order collectively, the rate is cheaper than individual imports,” says Eric Kabera, head of communications and marketing at PSF.

To benefit from advanced technologies available elsewhere in the world, the Rwandan government in May this year signed an agreement with Chinese firm Pink Mango C&D to establish a modern garment factory in the Kigali Special Economic Zone. Emmanuel Hategeka, deputy chief executive officer of the Rwanda Development Board, responsible for implementing Vision 2035, has said the move would help the country revive its mills by creating 7,500 jobs and reduce the import of used garments. The government is also encouraging civil servants to wear Rwandan designer clothes on the last Friday of every month.

But the government must not drop its guard. Rwanda’s market is already stacked with another variety of low-cost clothing — the ones made by China. All the efforts to become an upper-middle income country would go waste if Rwandans find those as suitable alternatives for imported second-hand clothes.

These are desperate times. Countries are trying to protect their own companies. AGOA, which initially offered development assistance to the low-income countries, has changed direction under the Trump administration. Writes Garth Frazer, a professor of economic analysis and public policy at the University of Toronto, Canada, who is also a member of the International Growth Centre Trade Research Group, “What is deeply concerning is when the members of EAC decided to increase the restrictions on used-clothes imports, the current US administration responded by threatening to remove AGOA benefits for them.”",India,2019.06

The recycled motor vehicles included 171,000 cars and 31,000 motorcycles, according to a statement on the ministry's website.

During the first five months, China recycled 878,000 scrapped motor vehicles, a year-on-year growth of 21.1 percent.

Some 735,000 cars and 143,000 motorbikes were recycled during the Jan.-May period, up 23.4 percent and 10.3 percent respectively.

China has been encouraging recycling of scrapped motor vehicles to promote a circular economy. Such vehicles are usually sold to remanufacturing companies.

The annual vehicle scrapping rate is 4 to 6 percent internationally, said Zhang Shuwei, director of the Department of Market System Development of the MOC, adding that China has a vast market for recycling scrapped vehicles.

The country had around 327 million motor vehicles at the end of last year, including 240 million automobiles, according to the traffic management bureau of the Ministry of Public Security.",China,2019.06
39,An Insight Into Circular Economy,"A few days back, the unemployment data was the focal point of Indian economy and now the focus has shifted to a comment made by CEO of Niti Aayog, Amitabh Kant in an event in Delhi on Monday that the circular economy can generate more than 1.4 -2 crore jobs in India.

In this particular post, Outlook Money takes a quick look at the concept on circular economy.

For a long time our economy has been linear and constituted three important stages, one was production that involves converting raw materials into the product, then after using those products thy are thrown out. There is no concept of reusing or recycling. Now, with the economy on an upward spiral and the exponentially rising population, the concerns for depletion of resources and raw materials has also gained fair amount of traction. To face all the pressing issues that the economy is facing right now, the only option for us is to move to circular economy.

So basically, circular economy is an industrial system that embraces restoration and regeneration, putting an end to use and throw concept. This economic system is seen as an alternative to linear economy that is all about make, use and dispose. Thus in the circular economic system the aim is to use products optimally, to do as much as refurbishments, repackaging, remanufacturing. So the basic objective is to keep things in use as long as possible.

Is this claim of generating 1.4 million jobs right or wrong?

Looking at the other parts of the world, the claim seems to be true. In 2014, European Commission estimated that jobs associated with circular economy employed 3.9 million people. And International Labour Organisation has projected that under circular economy worldwide, the employment would grow by 0.1% by 2030. The 2018 report by Cambridge Econometrics and Trinomics and ICF titled as concludes that circular economy will add 0.5 % to Europe’s GDP and a net increase of 700,000 jobs. A 2017 report by Circle Economy and Ehero estimates that 8 % of the Dutch workforce is currently employed in circular economy jobs. So after looking at the data from all other countries of the world, it seems true that circular economy has potential to generate 1.4 crore jobs in next 5-7 years.

Which countries have already embraced circular economy?

There are many countries in the world that have a piece of legislation that made mandatory on every ones part to reuse the products. Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden, Japan, Scotland are a few countries those who have adopted legislation to push the reuse and refurbish things. These countries have their own goals set for the respective years in order to get desired result from this economical transition. For example: The Danish government set a goal to recycle 50% of all household waste by 2022. Similarly many other countries are also have set goals. China also has circular economy in its policy since 2000.

What to hope for?

Now, with this comment of Amitabh Kant, now the speculations are rife that whether the government will bring in any piece of legislation, taking cue from European countries such as Denmark, Sweden and Netherlands. To get clarity on this issue we will have to wait and watch, that what necessary actions this government is going to take.",India,2019.06

50,Nr instant produce (NRF) confirms its worldwide mission to create circular economy food system,"Nr instant produce (NRF) confirms its worldwide mission to create circular economy food system with donation of usd 250,000 regenerative agriculture grant to U.S.- based start up at foodshot global.

Bangkok, Thailand June 2019 – Following its successful product launch of ‘Sabzu’ at ThaiFex 2019 and ambitious plans to take leadership role in global Specialty Foods industry, the Southeast Asia’s foods manufacturer NR Instant Produce (NRF) continues to conquer yet another proud achievement across the globe- this time in New York City- towards feeding the world through sustainability with granting the highest regenerative agriculture grant to a US-based innovation tool in advancing Soil 3.0 that’ll change the way farms live, eat, and breathe.

Earlier in 2019, NRF has announced a corporate rebranding and clear commitments to both sustain and revolutionize the foods industry as well as the specialty food business. Now, they are pioneering a path few food manufacturers have done- supporting, investing, and granting funds to innovative companies that can promise a healthy food system that can nourish 10 Billion people and sustain earthly resources.

As CEO of NRF and Chairman of Path Foundation, Mr. Danai Pathomvanich has flown to New York City to attend as one of the founding donors of initiative and a member of the selection committee to present the Moonshot Prize at FoodShot Global, a non-profit organization of world-class partners empowering bold ideas and innovative companies to accelerate the transformation to a healthy, sustainable, and equitable food system. FoodShot Global launched its investment platform in 2018 aimed to accelerate food system transformations through annual challenges called ‘Moonshot for Better Foods’- a global call for entrepreneurs, researchers, and advocates on a specific topic within the food and agriculture space. Applicants with most qualified solutions are then selected to receive grants or equity prizes from the FoodShot’s integrated capital platform. Best in-class candidates will receive equity and debt financing for their business; cash prizes will be rewarded for rising stars working within research, social enterprise, and advocacy. In 2018, Moonshot For Better Foods topic was Innovating Soil 3.0 Solutions. This year’s topic was Soil 3.0 under the theme ‘regenerative agriculture’ – an aligned mission for Path Foundation (a founding donor of FoodShot Global) and a core philosophy all too familiar to NRF.

A total of four prizes were awarded; two Moonshot prizes of $250,000, a research grant of $35,000, and a social equity prize of $3,000,000 to Trace Genomics. Mr. Danai handed out the Moonshot Prize of $ 250,000 to COMET-Farm, a Colorado-based Whole Farm and Ranch Carbon and Greenhouse Gas Accounting System. COMET-Farm estimates the ‘carbon footprint’ for all or part of farming and ranch operations then allows farmers to evaluate different options for reducing GHG emissions and sequestering more carbon. General guidance on the system is provided about potential changes to your management practices that are likely to sequester carbon and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Amazingly, the system also uses detailed spatially-explicit data on climate and soil conditions specifically for location and allows farmers to enter detailed information for their field and livestock operations to produce an accurate estimate tailored to your specific situation. How’s that for reducing world’s carbon footprint?

“Regenerative Agriculture is the key for the future. The need to save the world and the need to save our health has been given media attention, however, the need to save on our soil has been something largely ignored. The Food And Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has cited that more than 90% of all the Earth’s soil could be degraded by 2050 as our world continues to extract higher tolls to produce more for a burgeoning population,” commented Mr. Danai Pathomvanich, CEO of NR Instant Produce (NRF).

“NRF’s vision aims to a make the world more sustainable with food products that are made from regenerative farming. We are grateful for government organizations that support this cause and without the help of world’s leading partners, organizations such as FoodShot Global, and local communities themselves, this goal of food system sustainability will not be reached. To enable us to achieve this, NRF also supports and seek to work with innovative startups who are focused not just on the science of regenerative agriculture, but the collaboration to make it accessible to the global community. This way, we will succeed in helping improve the farming system in Thailand that we currently work with and hopefully, the entire industry as a whole,” added Mr. Danai.

In collaboration with Path Foundation and FoodShot Global, NRF is announcing qualifying Thai entrepreneurs, policy makers, NGOs, and others to apply and get involved with the next MoonShot For Better Foods Challenge 2020. Everything will be bigger and better, with prizes up to $1,000,000 in grant money and $20,000,000 in social equity.

68,Circular Economy likely to generate 1.4 crore jobs in 5-7 years - Amitabh Kant,"Mr Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog said that Circular Economy has the potential to generate 1.4 crore jobs in next 5-7 years and create lakhs of new entrepreneurs. Speaking at the '3rd Edition of Circular Economy Symposium 2019' organised by FICCI, Mr Kant said that sustainable development and resource circularity is the need of the hour to implement Circular Economy.

Mr Kant further highlighted that by 2050, world population would reach 9.7 billion of which 3 billion people would prosper to middleclass consumption level. This would require 71 per cent more resources per capita, thereby raising total mineral and material demand from 50 billion tonnes in 2014 to 130 billion tonnes in 2050.

Mr Kant added that if the 'End of Life Vehicle' policy was implemented with dated emission standards then by 2021, over 22 million vehicles will be off the road. This would include 80 per cent two-wheelers, 14 per cent cars, and 3 per cent each of three-wheelers and commercial vehicles. ""End of Life Vehicles present huge business opportunity for growth, wealth creation and jobs,"" he added.

He stressed upon the need for promoting non-government organizations to spread awareness and developing Circular Economy as a national agenda.

Resource circularity is need of the hour to implement circular economy,” he said.

A circular economy is an alternative to a traditional linear economy (make, use, dispose) in which resources are kept in use for as long as possible, the maximum value is extracted from them whilst in use, the products and materials are recovered and regenerated at the end of each service life. This economic system is aimed at minimising waste and making the most of resources.

Kant underlined the need for legislation to promote the circular economy in the country. “Several countries have recognised the centrality of the circularity as the new paradigm for sustainable development. They have not only embraced the concept of circular economy in their daily life but also brought in regulations to ensure higher compliance and promote more reuse, refurbishment and recycling,” he said.

He said that by 2050, the world population would reach 9.7 billion of which 3 billion people would prosper to middle-class consumption level.

""Application of industry's 4.0 technologies can be integrated to reuse and recycle,"" he said.

Seeing the potential benefits of taking steps towards a circular economy, Kant urged the industry to develop sound business models around it. He also added that the NITI Aayog has developed an adequate framework for it.

NITI Aayog drew up a National Material Recycling Policy draft and held a stakeholder discussion earlier this year. However, Kant said that only policies and defining roles were not enough, as this needs to be followed up by appropriate legislation.

The National Material Recycling Policy aims to lay down a framework for the recycling industry and encourage large scale recycling for all goods. It also aims at creating more jobs through this industry's growth. According to Kant, recycling of major waste could generate 1.2 to 1.3 crore jobs.

He added that circular economy practices could also help the ailing agricultural sector. ""The agriculture sector is perpetually challenged to provide supply for a large population. A circular economy will help the agriculture sector become more efficient,"" he said.

84,Circular economy can create 1.4 crore jobs in next 5 to 7 years: NITI Aayog CEO,"NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant threw his weight behind India developing its own circular economy ecosystem, quoting estimates to say it could generate more than one crore jobs. There are calls for circular economy to be included in the school curricula, while industry body FICCI has released a study paper on how the circular economy could work for the plastics industry. So, what exactly does this seemingly-new buzzword mean?

Circular economy, also referred to as 'circularity', is a way of managing resources so that they are used to the maximum and once the life cycle is complete, is refurbished or recycled, in whole or in part, and reused. You might say, we Indians, naturally spendthrift and value conscious, do not need to be taught this but in this case, we are referring to applying these principles on an industrial scale. This 'regenerative' approach contrasts directly with the conventional, linear model of capitalist economy, which works on the model of 'make, use and dispose.'

So why is the Indian government, NITI Aayog in particular, so excited about applying the principles of circularity on Indian economy? To start with, it is the great job factor. According to Kant, a full application of circular economy tenets to Indian manufacturing and economy could mean as much as 1.4 crore jobs in the next five to seven years. It could also spawn lakhs of small businesses, too.

Kant, who was speaking at a symposium on Circular Economy organised by FICCI in the national capital, also pointed out how the rising global population, slated to hit 9.7 billion by 2050 would have at least 3 billion people in the middle-class consumption level. “This would require 71 per cent more resources per capita, thereby raising total mineral and material demand from 50 billion tonnes in 2014 to 130 billion tonnes in 2050.”

Simply put, planet earth may simply struggle to provide resources for all that many people. The writing on the wall is clear: sustainable development and resource circularity is the need of the hour.

Kant added that if the ‘End of Life Vehicle’ policy with dated emission standards was implemented, then over 22 million vehicles will be off the road in two years time. This would include 80 per cent two-wheelers, 14 per cent cars, and 3 per cent each of three-wheelers and commercial vehicles. “End of Life Vehicles present huge business opportunity for growth, wealth creation and jobs,” he said.

Speaking at the Circular Economy Conference organized by the Delegation of the European Union to Malaysia, Yeo said pushing for change would in fact spur the local economy as new solutions were developed to cope with the problem of waste and limited resources.

""A lot of people ask me, as a small country why do we need to do all these things. Whatever we do here will leave a very little impact.

""I always answer that whenever we push for something, we are the front liner for something, we create industry and jobs and growth through that and Malaysia would like to be a leader in Southeast Asia, in the green economy and green growth,"" she said.

Yeo said the government would take a multi-pronged approach towards developing a circular economy including raising public awareness, providing financial incentives to companies and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and legislation.

However, she said the government would take steps to lead by example as it was the single largest consumer in the country and spent the greatest amount through the annual national budget.

""Government is the largest consumer so the government must lead by example. The chief secretary to the government had issued a directive to all ministries to follow the roadmap in their events and activities.

""The government spends 280 billion ringgit (67.2 billion U.S. dollars) in its annual budget every year.

192,Across China: From trash to cash: Innovative treatment of chicken waste lays golden eggs - Xinhua | English.news.cn,"FUZHOU, June 8 (Xinhua) -- At around 7 a.m., trucks loaded with tonnes of chicken bones, heads and intestines arrive at a waste disposal plant and dump the non-edible chicken parts into an underground container through a small hole.

""It's like filling oil tanks in a gas station,"" said Jiang Haijun, general manager of the plant in Guangze County, eastern China's Fujian Province.

The waste is then pumped into a chain of cauldrons and tubes in a separate room for high-temperature sterilization, steaming and drying. Five hours later, the waste is converted into fish feed.

The plant, which is able to treat 300 tonnes of chicken waste each day, is owned by Fujian Sunner Group, one of Asia's largest chicken breeders headquartered in Guangze. The poultry giant is the supplier of chicken products for KFC and McDonald's on the Chinese mainland.

Last year, Sunner's breeding farms in Guangze produced 300 million broilers along with 60,000 tonnes of waste, which were turned into 8,000 tonnes of animal feed by the plant.

The feed was sold at up to 13,000 yuan (about 1,880 U.S. dollars) per tonne, said Jiang.

""It's an eco-friendly way to treat poultry waste, let alone the profits,"" Jiang said. ""We might risk polluting groundwater by landfill or spreading diseases by dumping untreated waste into fish ponds.""

He added that a large amount of steam and hot water generated during the processing of chicken waste is later sent back to nearby poultry slaughterhouses and used for plucking chicken feathers.

Jiang's waste disposal facility offers a glimpse into Sunner's efforts to go waste-free.

About a five minutes' drive from the facility lies a cluster of plants that dispose of chicken blood, feathers and sewage produced by Sunner's farms. One plant turns chicken blood into protein powder, while another converts chicken feathers into animal feed.

Last year, a local biomass power plant used around 28 tonnes of chicken manure from Sunner's farms to generate 163 million kilowatt hours of electricity. Most of the electricity, worth more than 100 million yuan, was provided to the State Grid.

Fu Longrun, vice director of Guangze's bureau of ecology and environment, said Sunner's model of circular economy is indicative of Guangze's efforts to make full use of solid waste and build a zero-waste city.

Enterprises in Guangze have developed techniques to convert bamboo scraps into charcoal sticks and turn construction waste into manufactured sand.

Guangze is among the 11 cities and five areas in China selected by the Chinese government last month to pilot waste-free programs. Other participating cities include Shenzhen, downtown Chongqing and Sanya in Hainan Province.

About 10 billion tonnes of solid waste are produced annually in China, according to Du Xiangwan, an academician from the Chinese Academy of Engineering.

The amount of waste, if poorly handled, will be a huge burden for the environment and a waste of resources, said Du.

Invited guests will share ideas and thoughts, make connections, reflections and create new contacts in a stimulating, inspiring and thought-provoking ambience. Some of Sweden’s most popular artistes, architects and designers will be here as well. After Hrs spoke to a few of them...

Chef Marco Baudone (left) and One of his dishes

It’s the first time that Michelin Star Chef Marco Baudone is visiting India and although he says he would love to explore Mumbai, the work trip will probably have him seeing more of the kitchen than any tourist spots. The chef will be presenting some Swedish courses and products, which he wants to keep under wraps for now. “Swedish cuisine has a rather old history but it has never been sexy. Fortunately, lately a new generation of chefs have started to relaunch old traditions with a twist — in a new style and lifting up products that haven’t been so used in a while. I am bringing my own hand-picked sprouts shoots that I have pickled for a very ‘forest’ feeling and of course, a very special marinated/cured herring,” he explains.

For Idun Baltzersen, who works cross-boundary, monumental and spatial with drawing and printmaking in various forms — on paper, textile and wood, it’s the first visit to the country. “There are more people living in Mumbai than in my home country and that, I think, will be a very different experience than Scandinavia. I am also looking forward to meeting the local exhibitors at the event,” she says. Idun will be showcasing the Scandinavian tradition of using woodcut. “I work with textile and India has a long history of textile production and printing. I think there is definitively a connection there, and it would be interesting to meet Indian artists using textile and people with connections to the textile industry. I was in a group exhibition recently, with a young Indian artist called Jayeeta Chatterjee recently and found her work very inspiring,” she says.

Julius Göthlin investigates the possibilities of creating two-dimensional worlds that stays in a constant motion — a presence that has more in common with sound, air and light than with physical objects. The artist is looking to explore the vibrance, the environment and the energy of the city through the people, architecture, colours, food and social life. The aspect of Sweden that Julius finds most unique is the movement and energy found in the nature and the different seasons over here. “In the paintings I will show at Swedish Style Mumbai, there is very much an energy that is connected to the Swedish scenery and cold weather through its cold-blue tones and sharp contrasts. The paintings have been made with pigments and sand from near my studio in Stockholm, so it has a very strong connection with the landscape. My aim is to hopefully share a small and subtle slice of the energy from the Swedish landscape and scenery,” he adds.

279,Adidas to begin next phase towards plastic-free oceans,"In fight for the oceans against marine plastic pollution, Adidas is upping the pace of change with the return of Run For The Oceans 2019 on June 8, World Oceans Day. The brand with its long-term partner Parley for the Oceans aims to raise $1.5 million to continue to invest in the education of future generations on the issue of marine plastic pollution.

The introduction of the 2019 Parley range will see the company produce a landmark 11 million pairs of shoes using upcycled marine plastic waste. The campaign this year will also unite more runners in more locations than ever before to lace up and Run For The Oceans in order to reach its increased goal of $1.5 million. For every kilometer completed between June 8 and 16, Adidas will contribute $1 to Parley Ocean School programmes, with every dollar going towards the next phase of the partnership with the development and launch of the Parley youth activist platform.

Adidas and Parley raised $1 million raised from Run For The Oceans 2018 to support the Parley Ocean School Program, educating and empowering 100,000 youth in affected coastal areas. The partnership saw five million pairs of shoes created using recycled ocean plastic in 2018 alone.

With the aim of engaging more young people than ever before and inspiring long-term behavior change, the platform will host a digital curriculum which equips schoolchildren with the skills, tools and knowledge required to protect the planet’s oceans. It will also act as a digital space where young people can come together, share ideas and gain access to events, mentors, and tools. Sign-ups open for the Parley youth activist platform on June 8, with the goal of bringing the Parley Ocean School Program to a global level.

While Run For The Oceans is a global movement, in India, Adidas has given the movement further wings by associating with advocate Afroz Shah, the UN Champion of Earth 2016, starting from 2018. The purposeful initiative has resulted into activities that tackle the problem of marine litter. Cleaning Mumbai beaches, conserving the mangroves, running ground action workshop to stop litter and segregate plastic waste and most importantly the ideology of a circular economy. The Indian edition of the Run For The Oceans will be held in Mumbai on June 8 at the Versova beach.

This year, the brand has joined hands with eco champions and young leaders of sustainability including Abhimanyu Chakravorty (founder Plogga India & environment activist), and Sumer Verma (India’ first marine photographer & conservationist) take the movement wider.

Inspiring the larger universe to join the movement, Adidas is bringing together its community of adidas Runners, brand ambassadors, employees, store partners, store staff, and even consumers to make a difference and contribute to reducing marine plastic pollution by participating on the on-ground and digital runs.

“The marine plastic crisis we’re facing has become critically urgent. We affect it daily through the plastics we use and throw away. Every minute, the equivalent of a dump truck of plastic waste enters our oceans and by 2050, this could mean there may be more plastic than fish in the world’s oceans. We know the stats and we’re aware of the issue. Now we need action. adidas x Parley has helped spread awareness of the crisis facing our oceans but also contributed to finding solutions. Back in 2016, we created the first performance products with recycled ocean plastics and went on to produce six million pairs of Adidas x Parley shoes by 2018, with a goal of making 11 million units this year, intercepting vast amounts of plastic from entering our oceans,"" Sharad Singla, brand marketing director, Adidas India, said.

""Run for the Oceans is an opportunity to celebrate the oceans, a place where runners unite to dedicate their time and energy and generate investment towards saving our oceans – this year, for our new activist platform, a global stage for the next generation of creators, leaders and thinkers. As the voice of our future, our youth make the most convincing teachers and best ambassadors, educating parents, industry leaders and politicians, and using media in the most native way. Youth are our biggest hope, since they are driven by the strongest of all motivations: their own survival. We are more than grateful for the generous support of our founding partner Adidas. It allows us to grow the movement into a superstorm of change,” Cyrill Gutsch, founder and CEO, Parley for the Oceans, said. (RR)",India,2019.06
344,EU Commission vice president expects Northern Europe to follow UK as promoter of market economy - Xinhua | English.news.cn,"HELSINKI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- EU Commission Vice President responsible for jobs, growth, investment and competitiveness Jyrki Katainen on Friday called for deeper cooperation between Northern European EU countries.

Talking to the Finnish national broadcaster Yle in Brussels, Katainen said Northern Europe assumes the role of the United Kingdom as a promoter for market economy in the European Union.

Katainen quoted German Chancellor Angela Merkel as saying that she ""expects more from the Nordics, the Baltics and some countries of Eastern Central Europe"".

Merkel had said that those countries should patch up the loss caused by the departure of the UK ""in developing the internal markets, trade policy and in pragmatic economic thinking"".

Discussing the policies of the upcoming Commission, Katainen believed it would continue many of the policies of the outgoing commission. He noted that the incoming President Ursula von der Leyen has talked in strong terms about circular economy, climate issues and the rule of law. Katainen also said he believes EU defense will be high in the future agenda.

Discussing his personal situation, Katainen said he sees no conflict of interest between his current role in the Commission and his application to become the top executive of the Finnish public sector think tank and catalyst, SITRA.

However, last week the outgoing Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker removed Katainen from the decision making on industrialization and innovation.

The work of SITRA focuses largely on the same development issues as those that Katainen has been responsible for in the Commission.",China,2019.07
399,China recycles 1 million junk vehicles in H1 - Xinhua | English.news.cn,"BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- China recycled 1.07 million scrapped vehicles in the first half of this year, up 22.8 percent year on year, data from the Ministry of Commerce showed.

The country recycled 895,000 cars and 170,000 motorcycles during the period, up 25.9 percent and 8.6 percent respectively, according to a statement on the ministry's website.

400,Make Fashion Circular frames guidelines for jeans,"The Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Make Fashion Circular initiative has framed guidelines for producing jean which set out minimum requirements on garment durability, material health, recyclability, and traceability. The guidelines are a joint effort by more than 40 denim experts from academia, brands, retailers, manufacturers, collectors, sorters, and NGOs.Based on the principles of the circular economy, the Jeans Redesign Guidelines will work to ensure jeans last longer, can easily be recycled, and are made in a way that is better for the environment and the health of garment workers.Participants to date include Arvind Limited, Bestseller (through the Vero Moda brand), Boyish Jeans, C&A, Gap, Hirdaramani, H&M Group (through the H&M and Weekday brands), HNST, Kipas, Lee, Mud Jeans, OuterKnown, Reformation, Sai-Tex, Tommy Hilfiger. The guidelines have been endorsed by clothing collectors and recyclers Bank and Vogue, Circular Systems, Evrnu, Hkrita, I:CO, Infinited Fibre Company, Lenzing, Recover, re:newcell, Texaid, Tyton Biosciences LLC, Wolkat, and Worn Again. They have also been endorsed by the NGOs Fashion Revolution and Textile Exchange.The guidelines build on existing efforts to improve jeans production, including the open source guide created following C&A and Fashion For Good’s joint initiative to develop C2C Gold Certified jeans. The Jeans Redesign will drive others to join the project and produce jeans in line with the guidelines at scale. The first pairs of the redesigned jeans will be on sale in 2020.""The way we produce jeans is causing huge problems with waste and pollution, but it doesn’t have to be this way. By working together we can create jeans that last longer, that can be remade into new jeans at the end of their use, and are made in ways which are better for the environment and the people that make them. This is just the start. Over time we will continue to drive momentum towards a thriving fashion industry, based on the principles of a circular economy,"" according to Francois Souchet, lead, Make Fashion Circular.The guidelines have been framed in line with the principle of respect for the health, safety, and rights of people involved in all parts of the fashion industry. These also advocate working conditions improvement in manufacturing globally. Beyond this, the guidelines provide minimum requirements for jeans on durability, material health, recyclability, and traceability.Jeans should withstand a minimum of 30 home laundries, while still meeting the minimum quality requirements of the brands. Garments should include labels with clear information on product care, the guidelines say.Jeans should be produced using cellulose fibres from regenerative, organic or transitional farming methods. Jeans should be free of hazardous chemicals and conventional electroplating. Stone finishing, potassium permanganate (PP), and sandblasting are prohibited, these say.On recyclability, the guidelines mention that jeans should be made with a minimum of 98 per cent cellulose fibres (by weight). Metal rivets should be designed out, or reduced to a minimum. Any additional material added to the jeans, should be easy to disassemble.In addition, information that confirms each element of the guideline requirements has been met should be made easily available. Organisations that meet the requirements will be granted permission to use the Jeans Redesign Logo on jeans produced in line with the guidelines. Jeans Redesign Logo use will be reassessed annually, based on compliance with reporting requirements. (SV)",India,2019.07
402,"Inditex to move to organic cotton, linen by 2025","Inditex has spelled out major sustainability targets which it aims to achieve in the near future. By 2025, it will only use cotton, linen and polyester that is organic, more sustainable or recycled. Cotton, linen and polyester –together with viscose, which will reach this target by 2023- constitute 90 per cent of the raw materials purchased by the group.In addition, 80 per cent of the energy used in the group activities (stores, logistic centres and offices) will be renewable.The sustainability goals were enumerated by Inditex’s executive chairman Pablo Isla at the Annual General Meeting in which shareholders ratified the group’s 2018 financial statements. In 2018, group revenue amounted to €26.15 billion, underpinned by growth in all the regions in which it does business, as well as in online sales, which accounted for 12 per cent of the total, having increased by 27 per cent last year. Net profit totalled €3.44 billion. These results paved the way for the payment of a dividend of €0.88 per share, a growth of 17 per cent year-on-year and of 83 per cent in the last five years.“Our digital transformation and determined progress towards the most demanding sustainability standards are complementary and underpinned by the efficiency of our long-standing business model, which is based on offering our customers the best in quality fashion,” said Isla. He also highlighted that “sustainability is a never-ending task in which everyone here at Inditex is involved and in which we are successfully engaging all of our suppliers; we aspire to playing a transformational role in the industry”.He said that by 2025 Inditex will only use cotton, linen and polyester that is organic, more sustainable or recycled. Use of cotton, linen and polyester –together with viscose, which will reach this target by 2023- constitute 90 per cent of the raw materials purchased by the Group. In addition, 80 per cent of the energy used in the Group activities (stores, logistic centres and offices) will be renewable.The first milestone, set for 2019, is for all of the Group’s platforms and head offices to meet the highest green building certificates and for 100 per cent of Zara stores to be eco-efficient (which is one year ahead of the original target). In addition, the at-home used clothing collection service currently operating in several cities in Spain and China will be extended to Paris, London and New York by September.Inditex will also complete the entire eco-efficient store platform by 2020. Zara will achieve this target in 2019, the rest of the brands will follow suit in 2020, assisted by the company’s effort to fine-tune and digitalise its sales footprint, he said.This year, the Group’s Join Life garments will account for one-quarter of the total. Join Life is the label used by all of the Group’s retail formats to single out the use of more sustainable raw materials such as organic cotton, recycled polyester and tencel and the prioritisation of more water and energy friendly processes.The volume of clothing featuring the Join Life label has already increased by 85 per cent in 2018 to 136 million garments. The Group is plans further significant growth in 2019 - of 110 per cent - and that by 2020 one in every four items of clothing put on sale will qualify for this sustainability label, he said.Towards sustainability goal, use of plastic bags will end by 2020 by all of the Group’s brands, with Zara, Zara Home, Massimo Dutti and Uterqüe already having done so. In 2018, only 18 per cent of all bags were made from plastic. Next year, all of the Group’s stores will have been fitted with containers for collecting used clothing for subsequent charitable purpose reuse or recycling. The Clothing Collection programme is one of the cornerstones of Inditex’s circular economy effort.That programme’s reach –in collaboration with a number of non-profit organisations- has increased to 24 markets; the 1,382 containers installed in the Group’s stores are complemented by the 2,000 street containers set up throughout Spain in collaboration with Caritas and the at-home pick up service operational nationwide in Spain. Since its launch, over 34,000 tonnes of garments, footwear and accessories have been collected through the dedicated containers placed in the company’s stores, offices and logistics platforms.Complementing this programme is the strategic commitment to researching new technologies for developing new recycling processes. By 2023, the company will have fully eliminated single-use plastics from customer sales and 100 per cent of the waste generated at the Group’s head offices, logistics platforms and stores will be sent for recycling or reuse, framed by the Zero Waste programme.Currently, the company is recycling or reusing 88 per cent of the waste. It will continue to introduce collection and recycling systems for all of the materials used in its package distribution and hanged garment operations (mainly FSC-certified cardboard boxes, recycled and recyclable plastic, alarms and hangers) for reuse within the supply chain itself or for recycling under the Green to Pack programme.By 2023, another of the most widely used raw materials, viscose, will be 100 per cent sustainable.“Our digital and sustainability transformation is only possible thanks to the solid business model performance, which is generating the funds needed to reinvest in the company’s future,” Isla said. He recalled that the company has invested over €9 billion during the last six years, over €2 billion of which has been earmarked to introducing technology designed to enhance the customer experience.

404,Climate change ministry devises strategy to free ICT from plastic bags,"ISLAMABAD-The Ministry of Climate Change has devised a 3-phase strategy to free Islamabad Capital Territory from plastic bags.

The ministry has made all preparations for a massive 3-tier campaign on plastic bags to make the ban a success, said an official of the ministry, Hassan Nasir Jamy.

The ministry had demanded a week from the federal cabinet for implementation action on the Statutory Regulatory Order (SRO) after its approval, he said.

“The implementation mechanism will kick start from the education and awareness of the masses in the first week. It will commence by the next till the end of July where the ministry would engage people to people contact to impart them knowledge on the hazards of plastic bags and reason for its ban,” the official said.

He said that the next week activities would focus on providing alternates and homemade solutions to the layman for plastic bags. There had been proposals by scientists to introduce household decomposing capacities for phasing out plastic bags, the official noted.

“We have suggested cotton bags, jute bags and any other bags except polythene bags as alternates in the SRO,” he added. However, in the last phase the implementation of the ban on plastic bags would be imposed from August 7 to 14, he added.

The ministry, he said, had made over 100,000 cotton bags which will be distributed among the masses in Friday and Sunday bazaars to acquaint them with the alternates of plastic bags.

“We will also distribute cotton bags in all ministries so that their staff could take up the message to shun use of plastic bags. The youth, students and civil society would be engaged for the distribution of cotton bags in the public places and bazaars,” the ministry official said.

Moreover, a massive awareness campaign on social, electronic and print media would be launched along with outdoor campaigns at metro stations, parks and other public places. The business community would also be involved in the process as it would be incorporated under corporate social responsibility (CSR), he said.

To a question, he said that no one was going to face unemployment and business crunch as it would involve merely the conversion of their plants to produce biodegradable plastic bags. “At present, there is only one unit in the federal capital which has the required paraphernalia to adapt during the implementation of ban,” he added.

Answering another question, he said that 80 per cent of the plastic bags in the federal capital come from Punjab province where the district administration would take all preemptive measures to avoid trafficking of plastic bags in the ICT.

He said that plastic bags had been a serious threat to our environment as it was the major cause for choking of drains, bad air quality due to its burning in open air and causing carcinogenic ailments due to the dissolving of plastic with the food.

Research Fellow at Sustainable Development Policy Institute Imran Saqib Khalid said that plastic bags had no doubt a share in the pollution of our environment but the core issue was of nonexistent proper waste management system namely technical landfill site.

He said that prior to legislation it was necessary to focus on behavioural change as public was dumping non-degradable and degradable waste together in the dumpsters. It was necessary to had an inclusive and holistic approach to overcome this issue which would not only help improve the system environmentally rather economically, he added.

“It is an opportunity for the government to pave the way for circular economy which is the concept that would help to accomplish the ambitious target of zero waste. It basically gives the idea of making waste or residue a source of income for others,” he added.",Pakistan,2019.07
411,Roundup: Experts call for fully-functional system in Poland to recycle better - China.org.cn,"You are here:

WARSAW, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has asked member countries to recycle 50 percent of municipal waste by 2020. While Poland has made some progress towards this goal, there are fears it may not reach it.

According to Eurostat, Poland recycled 33.8 percent of municipal waste in 2017, compared to the average of 46.4 across the bloc. While Poland performed better than some of the eastern European and Mediterranean countries, in late 2018, the European Commission warned Poland was one of 14 EU countries at risk of not meeting the 2020 recycling targets.

Poland's Supreme Audit Office announced last year that almost all the localities it controlled were unlikely to meet the 2020 target.

And unlike most western European countries, which have decades of experience with recycling, Poland is relatively new at this and has much ground to cover in a short span of time.

The main problem with Poland's efforts to do better at recycling over the last years, according to experts, has been the absence of a coherent countrywide system that citizens could be educated about and companies could get used to.

Until 2017, each locality in Poland was free to organize its own recycling system, which in practice meant that each place had a different container system and recycled a different range of materials.

Because the old system was confusing and inefficient, Poles across the country are currently being introduced to a unified system implemented across all of Europe: recycling will be done into five categories -- paper, glass, metal, plastics and packaging, and compost and mixed.

""Having a coherent system across the country, with the same colors of containers, makes it possible to have a nationwide information campaign to educate people about recycling -- and this is very important,"" Slawomir Brzozek from Poland-based Our Earth Foundation told Xinhua.

Another major debate happening in Poland and Europe at the moment concerns the responsibility of producers for the waste they generate, especially via packaging.

For years, Polish companies have been made responsible to ensure that part of the waste they cause is recycled, but the system was not working. Companies routinely subcontracted this function to so-called ""recovery firms"" which were tasked with ensuring the recycling target was met.

""Some of these firms did not help create a system of collecting and transforming the waste. Instead, they saw their role as helping companies meet their legal goals as cheaply as possible and make a profit while they were at it,"" explained Brzozek.

""Now we're discussing in Poland whether this kind of firms are needed at all. There is an interesting proposal to limit their number and transform them -- so they not only play a role in waste collection, but also supervise the matching of recycling companies who provide secondary materials with producers who could use them,"" said Brzozek.

As part of the EU's Circular Economy Package, adopted in 2018 and to be implemented by member states over the following two years, the responsibility of producers for their products will be extended, which means companies will have to bear more of the burden of managing their products and their packaging after they've been used by consumers. This works as an incentive for companies to take environmental considerations into account when designing packaging and products and should reduce recycling costs for other actors like municipalities.

Making sure that the collected waste is transformed and then actually bought by companies which could use it to produce goods is a major challenge in Poland, said Brzozek, noting this market is currently broken. The producers themselves should play a bigger role in this, if the circular economy is to work.

On top of that, to make it worthwhile for companies to buy recovered materials, large quantities have to be available -- supply should be guaranteed. In the case of Poland, according to Brzozek, such large supplies were usually not certain.

""We discovered in Poland that a waste economy organised on only liberal economic principles doesn't work effectively enough. In Poland, the unseen hand of the market has caused not high enough levels of collecting and recycling, but very visible fires,"" Brzozek told Xinhua.

He's referring to numerous fires happening over the last years either at landfills or at deposits of recycled materials -- some thought to be accidental, others intentional. Starting a fire can be motivated by the need to make more space for new materials when the company has not been able to sell the existing ones.

In 2018, the Polish government adopted two pieces of legislation that are meant to contain the so-called ""junk mafia"" thought to be behind the intentional fires.

Monika Bieniek from the Polish Recycling Association, representing recycling companies, said the new laws bring many new requirements on companies, including the obligation to install video monitoring and fire management systems, more checks by authorities and the need to pay financial deposits to prevent abandoning waste.

One of the biggest concerns is that the new legislation reduces the length of time a recycling company can deposit the waste on its premises, which prevents companies from purchasing larger volumes at lower prices when available on the market, argued Bieniek.

""Unfortunately for recycling companies, the situation is difficult and does not favour the development of the companies -- instead, it will lead to producers turning away from recovered to new raw materials, which will not favour the development of a circular economy in Poland,"" Bieniek told Xinhua.

According to the Polish Recycling Association, because of the current legal changes, as much as a quarter of producers will resign from the use of secondary raw materials in the following years.

Unlike some western European countries, whose recycling market is almost saturated, Poland has made fast progress in the last years. Nevertheless, to meet the ambitious goals the EU has set for member states, building a fully functional waste management system is key, argued analysts.

""What is problematic in Poland is the inconsistency when it comes to waste management. We often reconsider things we introduced, or try to work out perfect things at once,"" said Brzozek.

""What we really need now is to just implement what has been planned. We need a clear system of collection and to create a law on Extended Responsibility of Producers. An active and appropriate role of the state is key in this process,"" the expert added. Enditem",China,2019.07
418,"Jaguar Land Rover and BASF trial new plastic recycling process, Auto News","ChemCycling project takes plastic waste and recycles it into premium material for potential use in future Jaguar and Land Rover models.

Recycled plastic material is currently being tested on prototype production parts in the all-electric Jaguar I-Pace to ensure it meets JLR's exacting quality and safety standards.

Jaguar Land Rover, working in conjunction with chemical company BASF, is trialling an innovative recycling process which converts plastic waste into a new premium grade material that could feature on future vehicles.

It is estimated that the amount of waste plastic is predicted to exceed 12 million tonnes globally by 2050. Today, not all of this plastic can be recycled for use in automotive applications – especially in vehicle parts that are required to meet the most exacting safety and quality standards.

Jaguar Land Rover is part of a pilot project called ChemCycling that upcycles domestic waste plastic, otherwise destined for landfill or incinerators, into a new high-quality material.

The waste plastic is transformed to pyrolysis oil using a thermochemical process. This secondary raw material is then fed into BASF’s production chain as a replacement for fossil resources; ultimately producing a new premium grade that replicates the high quality and performance of ‘virgin’ plastics. Importantly, it can be tempered and coloured making it the ideal sustainable solution for designing the next-generation dashboards and exterior-surfaces in Jaguar and Land Rover models.

Jaguar Land Rover and BASF are currently testing the pilot phase material in a Jaguar I-Pace prototype front-end carrier overmoulding to verify it meets the same stringent safety requirements of the existing original part.

Pending the outcome of the trials and progression in taking chemical recycling to market readiness, adoption of the new premium material would mean Jaguar Land Rover could use domestically derived recycled plastic content throughout its cars without any compromise to quality or safety performance.

Taking on a global challenge

 Chris Brown, Senior Sustainability Manager at Jaguar Land Rover, said: “Plastics are vital to car manufacturing and have proven benefits during their use phase, however, plastic waste remains a major global challenge. Solving this issue requires innovation and joined-up thinking between regulators, manufacturers and suppliers.

“At Jaguar Land Rover, we are proactively increasing recycled content in our products, removing single-use plastics across our operations and reducing excess waste across the product lifecycle. The collaboration with BASF is just one way in which we are advancing our commitment to operating in a circular economy.”

This, according to JLR, is the latest example of its commitment to addressing the challenge of waste plastic. The company has collaborated with Kvadrat to offer customers alternative seat options that are both luxurious and sustainable. The high-quality material, available initially on the Range Rover Velar and Range Rover Evoque, combines a durable wool blend with a technical suedecloth that is made from 53 recycled plastic bottles per vehicle.

Jaguar Land Rover has already met its 2020 target for Zero Waste to Landfill for UK operations. This includes the removal of 1.3 million square metres – equal to 187 football pitches – of plastic from its manufacturing lineside and replacing 14 million single use plastic items in business operations.

432,Pakistan’s gradual transition into a circular economy of plastics,"Plastic, being impervious to water, low-cost and highly durable, is used by Pakistanis in their everyday lives in many forms, as it also is throughout the world. Due to its unrivalled functionality, its production and use is increasing more than any other known material. From transporting products to contributing to improved health outcomes and reducing food wastage by prolonging its life, plastic is providing inexpensive solutions with high performance for everything.

Owing to rapid urbanisation, a booming population and increasing consumerism, Pakistan’s plastic industry is flourishing at an annual growth rate of 15% with production capacity reaching a whopping 624,200 metric tonnes per annum. However, the burgeoning use of plastic is unbalancing the scale due to its carbon footprint and negative effect on ecosystems. Based on current data, Pakistan produces 50,438 tonnes of Municipal Solid Waste per day out of which 67% is organic, 5% is paper and about 18% is plastic, amounting to 6.41 million tonnes of plastic waste annually; a clear indicator of an impending problem of massive proportions.

Out of all the types of plastic wastes, single-use plastic bags with an average life span of 12 minutes, are non-recyclable and a massive problem both for land and oceans, as they are generally made from non-degradable low-density polyethylene (LDP/LDPE) and can remain in the environment for 400 years or more. (Source: Geyer et. Al (2017), Our World in Data)

Scientists are trying to find other possibilities to end this epidemic by adding pro-oxidants to recycle plastic bags into oxo-biodegradable plastics. However, the adaptability has been undeniably sluggish due to cost differential between biodegradable and ordinary bags with unending debates about the production of increased greenhouse gas emissions in the process. Additionally, in case of reusable plastic bags, there is a constant health risk due to development of bacteria; rejecting its use.

On the contrary, studies show that PET (Polyethylene terephthalate) waste can be efficiently recycled back into the value-chain in a sustainable and profitable way. As per a World Bank report, beverages and packaging industries are the main producers of PET wastes and in 2016 alone, the world generated 242 million tonnes of plastic PET waste. This situation can be turned around through recycling of PET with a few changes in strategic planning, adapted from developed circular economies i.e. through an approach aimed at minimising waste and making the most of resources.

Collecting and recycling PET is a big challenge, but certainly not an insurmountable one, and even though we see a lot of recycled plastics in the form of disposable packaging or other short-lived items, the conventional approach is not sustainable. Use of plastic wastes in concrete building blocks is a promising recycling approach due to lower quality requirements of plastic waste and higher fire resistance, durability, functional and insulation properties of concrete blocks. Developed nations like Japan, Scotland and others use recycled PET/R-PET in construction of roads, tunnels, bridge piers and underground storage silos. Other innovative uses include fibres in textile industry, clear sheets and strapping tapes used for packaging, cosmetics and toiletries containers, vehicle parts, bags, shoes, tees, mobile phone covers, gardening supplies including shovels and water cans, recycling bins, pencil cases and other items.

Although transitioning into a circular economy will be a challenging task, the long-term benefits of taking this route are substantial for our society and natural environment, which will require efforts from all the stakeholders and not just the government to achieve zero plastic waste. In this regard, it is heartening to learn that one major user of PET bottles for its beverages, Coca-Cola, has taken the lead in the industry by announcing in January 2018, a bold and ambitious goal to globally recycle each and every bottle it produces by the year 2030. According to a recent news story in the daily papers, Coca-Cola in Pakistan has already started action for achieving this global goal locally, by commissioning WWF-Pakistan to carry out a comprehensive and empirical study of the life cycle of post-consumer use PET bottles, and analysing the findings to propose solutions for establishing the circular economy. The WWF Report is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks, and one feels confident that its findings and recommendations will show a clear way forward for policy-makers.

With the introduction of regional bans on single-use plastic bags, Pakistan is pacing towards active implementation of UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Pakistan now needs to invest in infrastructure to expand its PET waste collection and recycling capacity, and develop a methodology for evaluating different options based on environmental, economic and social impacts. By facilitating the gathering and sharing of reliable information and data, Pakistan can foster open innovation and knowledge exchange between innovators, industry and the public to ensure nationwide activities such as circular design training and circular public procurement of plastics.

457,Feature: Japanese liquor producer explores circular economy by using sweet potatoes to generate electricity - Xinhua | English.news.cn,"TOKYO, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Kirishima Shochu Company, the largest producer of liquor in Japan, has been making efforts in exploring and demonstrating the development of circular economy by using the large amount of liquor waste from its production process for biomass power generation.

Located in the Miyazaki Prefecture on the Kyushu Island, Kirishima Shochu Company has a history of more than 100 years. Kirishima means ""a foggy island"" in Japanese.

The company uses sweet potatoes as its main raw material for making Japanese shochu, consuming up to 425 tons per day, according to Kirishima's introduction. The factory produces an average of 850 tons of brewing waste and 15 tons of sweet potato residue per day, with the brewing waste containing about 95 percent of water.

In the past, the company had to spend a lot of energy and money to deal with these wastes, which is a complicated process to be recycled by professional companies. In 2014, the shochu maker began to make full use of the waste generated in the production process to explore biomass power generation.

The staff first need to fill storage tanks with sweet potato residue and wine waste to be crushed and cooled. The wastes are then injected into biogas reactors to produce gas mainly made up of methane by the action of methane bacteria.

In this step, the solid-liquid separation step of the wastes is completed which generates solid sludge for centralized composting. The fertilizer from the compost will be returned to the crop fields and be used to grow sweet potatoes, the company's raw material for shochu making. The liquid waste produced in the process is then purified through sewage treatment plants and eventually discharged into sewers.

According to the company, it can produce 34,000 cubic meters of methane per day, which can be used by 22,000 households if it is all used for power generation.

Kirishima uses some of the gas for its own production, mainly as fuel for the distilling process, while the rest is used to generate electricity.

The company said that it currently generates 8.5 million KWH a year. In addition to the plant's own use, by selling surplus electricity to Kyushu electric power company, the shochu producer generates 240 million yen (2.22 million yen) of revenue every year.

Yoshikazu Higashimori, head of the waste treatment department of the company, said the project can make full use of its raw material and saves 3,000 tons of carbon emissions per year for the plant.

It not only solves the waste disposal problem that has plagued the company for a long time, but also brings the new business of power generation that has even generated some profits, he said.

Higashimori said that in the future, the company will continue to work hard to achieve the goal of zero emission.

In recognition of its contribution to the cause of environmental protection, the Japanese government awarded the shochu maker for realizing the goal of ""environmentally symbiotic factory."" In 2016, the company was awarded for its contribution to energy conservation and emission reduction by the Japanese government.

The company also opens its waste treatment facility to the public as the last stop of its factory tour to promote the awareness of environmental protection.",China,2019.07

(Xinhua/Zhang Cheng

LUXEMBOURG, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The three-year-old Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) on Saturday further expanded its membership to 100 with the approval of the African newcomers of Benin, Djibouti and Rwanda.

The decision was made unanimously by AIIB's Board of Governors at its fourth annual meeting held in Luxembourg.

The three prospective non-regional members will officially join the AIIB once they complete the required domestic processes and deposit the first capital installment with the bank.

In the meantime, the bank's meeting elected Chinese Finance Minister Liu Kun as chairman of the board.

With its approved membership increasing to 100, and the volume of approved financing expanding to 8.5 billion U.S. dollars, the AIIB has become an important member of multilateral development system, said Liu at the bank's annual meeting.

The China-initiated multilateral financial institution began operation in January 2016 with 57 founding members, with an agenda focused on supporting sustainable development through infrastructure and other productive sectors in Asia and beyond.

Lauding the progress the AIIB has made over the last three years, Liu said that the AIIB has been granted permanent observer status by the United Nations General Assembly, issued its first U.S.-dollar-denominated global bond, as well as developed a series of important strategies and policies.

""AIIB members collectively account for 78 percent of the world's population and 63 percent of global GDP. With the backing of all of our members, we are building a lean, clean, and green institution that can help to support their sustainable development,""said AIIB President Jin Liqun.

On the bank's continuous enlargement, AIIB Vice President and Corporate Secretary Sir Danny Alexander commented, ""That another 43 members have joined in the last three years is recognition that AIIB has established itself as part of the rules-based international system, with strong governance and high international standards.""

According to him, the widely-represented bank takes interest in expanding its business in Africa.

""We now have members on every continent, and we welcome the growing interest of African countries in AIIB. We look forward to working with Benin, Djibouti and Rwanda to support their development in the years to come,"" he said.

Under the theme ""Cooperation and Connectivity,"" the two-day annual AIIB meeting kicked off in Luxembourg on Friday for the first time outside Asia. It drew over 1,000 AIIB officials, representatives from members and partner institutions, business leaders and experts.

The meeting this year highlighted stronger Asia-Europe cooperation and connectivity, digital connectivity, climate change, sustainable infrastructure and mobilizing finance for circular economy transitions.

The bank's board of governors decided to hold its fifth annual meeting in Beijing on July 2-3, 2020.

The AIIB has approved 46 projects worth 8.5 billion U.S. dollars in 18 members, such as building highways and power plants.

The remarkable results have testified to the bank's operational efficiency, according to Luxembourg's Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna. ""We are glad we contributed from the beginning to the setting-up of AIIB, because this bank is a real success story,"" he told Xinhua.

In particular, he expressed his belief that multilateralism is the only way to solve the worldwide issues like poverty and climate change, and the AIIB is an important instrument.

""If we do not embark on sustainable development, if we do not try to save countries with a low standard of living through sustainable investment, if we don't do these things well, climate change will make sure that the temperature would rise above two degrees and that our planet may basically not survive,"" Gramegna noted.",China,2019.07

512,IPMMI hosts seminar on packaging and sustainability,"The Institute of Packaging Machinery Manufacturers of India (IPMMI) hosted a seminar on sustainability in packaging at Chembur Gymkhana, Mumbai recently. The event was attended by packaging industry professionals, including government officials, consultants, associations, and trade fair organisers.

Samir Limaye, president, IPMMI, welcomed to the members, guests, special invitees and speakers. Makdum Jahan, IPMMI committee compared the event.

The event provided vital insights for packaging machinery manufacturers and brands, to address the long-standing debate on plastic and its sustainable alternatives.

Marzban Thanevala, former senior VP, business development and marketing, Huhtamaki PPL, raised an interesting point on the way plastics are portrayed. He said, “The optics around plastics and the images that flash around the world are demeaning the core properties of plastic. We must understand that, as of today, there is a huge momentum in terms of talking about regulations. As far as lawsuits are concerned, we cannot just say that we are all fine.”

He also spoke about the packaging regulations in India, which included that all flexible packaging laminates in India got under the ‘recyclable’ category in 2018.

Thanevala also highlighted the opportunities for FFS packaging machines with polymer laminates from the same family, and the new packaging machines to replace the current lines with retrofits and modifications. Highlighting the regulations regarding multilayer plastics he added, plastics are being directly or indirectly used in all forms of packaging.

According to Dr S Radhakrishnan, director - research development and Innovation, MIT, over 500-billion plastic bags are used per day worldwide, out of which, the plastic generated in India is 15,342-tonnes per day. “The problem lies in segregation; a separate bin for compostable and recyclable waste is a must,” he said.

Radhakrishnan added,” Sustainability, green industry and green technology are concurring. If we go into the material aspect of all this, flexible packaging market is growing. And in fact, it is so much so that it is expected to reach 250-billion dollars by 2024 in the packaging sector alone.”

He stated that India is the first country to use milk pouches, and the needs packaging of perishable requires development. “Over 40% of plastics are used in packaging and recyclability is the only choice,” he said.

In addition, he emphasised synthetic paper being a good alternative as it is totally recyclable, printable and foldable, like any other paper and provided 12 points which decide whether the process is green that included prevention of waste, design for degradation, and use of renewable feedstock, among others.

“There is not one single alternative to sustainability; it can only be achieved as a whole,” added Radhakrishnan.

Rajesh Kumar Gera, assistant vice-president, RIL, shed light on PET as the sustainable packaging material. According to Gera, PET is a greener material than any glass or metal, if used in correct proportions and if it is recycled properly. In India, PET is widely recycled for on food applications such as shampoos, but even that has to be FDA approved and for food-based PET recycling facilities should come into the picture.

“We have to find ways to deal with the solution than banning it, we need to deal with plastic pollution,” said Gera, adding that the global challenges for the next five years is to achieve the same quality and properties of the recycled PET’s and the establishments of appropriate recycling facilities.

Dr R Rangaprasad, business head, Packaging 360, stressed on the point that a circular economy relies on recycling and repair to create an almost closed loop in order to reduce waste. He shed lights on the sustainable adhesives for flexible packaging and recycling of polystyrene.

Highlighting the recent developments carried out by the brands, he gave the examples of Dabur’s mega-plastic waste recycling initiative, ITC’s model to collect multi-layer plastic waste with PMC and Amazon’s packaging-free shipment program to nine cities in India.

Altogether, few of the conclusions that can be extracted from the experts are the importance of recycling and recycling facilities, PET as a great sustainable alternative, and the chance to develop packaging machines for the future of sustainable packaging.

Ashok Kothari, board of governor, IPMMI, shared about IPMMI and his thoughts on packaging and sustainability, followed by felicitation of speakers by Mahendra Mehta, board of governor, IPMMI and special guests by Samir Limaye.

517,EU environment ministers urge further impetus to promote circular economy - China.org.cn,"You are here:

HELSINKI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- EU environment and climate ministers on Friday urged the European Union to continue its policies supporting circular economy.

In a meeting in Helsinki that concluded on Friday, the ministers discussed the need to draw up an update on the circular economy action plan of the EU. The ministers noted that new measures are needed especially in areas concerning construction, textiles, mobility and food.

According to a news release issued after the meeting, Finland will be preparing conclusions on the circular economy based on the discussions. The EU Environmental Council will then discuss the prospects this autumn. The conclusions will set out how the new European Commission should, in the opinion of the environmental ministers, promote the circular economy over the next five years.

Finnish Minister of the Environment and Climate Krista Mikkonen said on Friday that ""through moving from a single-use culture to a circular economy, the EU alone could halve industrial greenhouse gas emissions by 2050"".

The competitiveness of the EU must be based on ""sustainability, mitigation of climate change and sparing, long-term use of renewable natural resources,"" Mikkonen listed.

According to the media release, the ministers who convened in the Helsinki Finlandia Hall defined that the goal must be ""a society that does not squander natural resources but creates new business opportunities"".

On the first day of the two-day meeting, the ministers had mainly tackled the internal problems in the EU on reaching agreement on carbon neutrality in 2050.

Commentators have noted that while issues directly related to the climate change and emissions have proven to be politically difficult in the EU, circular economy as a theme is ""politically easier"".

""Circular economy as concept has now heavy political legacy,"" an EU expert said. Enditem",China,2019.07
562,EU conference discusses ethical dimensions of transition into bio-economy - Xinhua | English.news.cn,"HELSINKI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Social sustainability and justice in bio-economy were the leading themes as 350 bio-economy experts gathered in Helsinki on Tuesday. The Bio-economy Scene 2019 conference was organized by the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the European Commission.

Matti Hayry, Professor of Business Philosophy at Aalto University, suggested more transparency and public honesty about winners and losers. He underlined that the assumption of a ""winning outcome to everyone"" will not materialize.

""Almost all bio-economy solutions will benefit some people and disadvantage others,"" he said. ""It is clear, for example, that meat producers will be harmed.""

Hayry said that systemic analyses should indicate sectors or people who will be harmed and whether it could be compensated and whether it should be compensated. The analyses should also estimate whether the overall benefits outweigh the harms.

Hayry is currently involved in a three year project on the ethics of the transition, ""Bio-economy and Justice"".

The aim of the conference in Helsinki was given as ""raising public awareness and promote dialogue on the progress towards a bio-economy"".

Jyrki Katainen, Vice President of the current European Commission, believed that an intra-EU rift like on the emissions is not very likely on bio-economy and circular economy.

In June the European Union summit failed to reach agreement on emission cutbacks for the envisaged carbon neutrality in 2050.

Talking to the media, Katainen said circular economy may be easier to accept as ""it keeps job creation running"". But he added that it is also fair to mention that there can be different interests in circular economy. For example, there is a battle on who can have access to waste streams.

Katainen underlined that the regulatory environment has to make profits possible. ""The idea is to shift market economy into a more sustainable direction,"" he summed up.

He said that humankind is facing ""a multifaceted sustainability challenge to which there is no single quick fix"", and repeated that the European Commission has adopted several measures, including the Circular Economy Action Plan and a comprehensive climate and energy package for 2030. Bio-economy has a central role in the decarbonization of economies.

Giovanni De Santi, Director at the Directorate for Sustainable Resources, European Commission's Joint Research Center, said at the press conference that the split on attitudes towards the emission cutbacks probably can also be attributed to communications. The envisaged requirements on emission cutbacks were given more like from the top downwards.

Jari Leppa, Finnish Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, said that solutions should be found that are based on the strengths of each member country. On that basis the countries will then develop their bio-economy strategies.

""In Finland, our strength lies in our extensive natural resources, especially forests that continue to be the cornerstone of our bio-economy,"" said Leppa.

Finland published its own national bio-economy strategy in 2014. Leppa described the Finnish bio-economy policy as successful. ""The bio-economy sector's output has outpaced that of the national economy on average, and we have seen big bio-refinery investments realized in Finland."" Enditem",China,2019.07
578,"Union Budget 2019-20: Same old wheel, neither oiled nor cleaned","The precipitous economic situation requires government to take control of the economy rather than sub-contract it to private capital

In the recent General Elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party made virtually no material promises to the people of the country. Consequently, the Union Budget 2018-19 offers nothing to anyone except to foreign and Indian capital.

In the opening statement of Budget Statement 2019 (BS), the BJP government identifies ‘India Inc’ as ‘India’s job creators’ and ‘the nation’s wealth creators’ with whom it will build ‘mutual trust’ ‘for kick-starting’ the economy.

Of course, the BS throws no light on why the economy needs ‘kick-starting’ after the BJP’s five years in government. Also, rather than looking towards the coming year, the BS only lists the BJP supposed achievements over the last five years.

Today, more than 7.5 per cent of the working population is unemployed apart from the millions who are underemployed especially in the rural areas. The economic situation has been worsening month-on-month as demand declines leading to persistently low investment and the possibility of further increases in unemployment and decline in wages.

The effects of the BJP’s failed economic policy have been felt most acutely in the country’s rural areas and in the agrarian economy. The precipitous economic situation requires government to take control of the economy rather than sub-contract it to private capital.

But this outsourcing is inevitable as the BJP government believes, as stated in the BS, that without foreign investment, especially investment in the stock market and real estate, the profits of private capital will stop ringing.

To this end the BJP government has sharpened its commitment to economic conservatism by lowering the total expenditure, in real terms, on National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA), Anganwadi services, the mid-day meal scheme, rural and urban housing schemes, the National Rural Health Mission, Ayushman Bharat, the unorganised sector workers’ pension scheme, PDS or National Food Security Act and Swachh Bharat.

The total expenditure on social security and social protection has been reduced by seven per cent without taking inflation into account. This will further push down disposable incomes resulting in the reduction of consumption and in turn the lowering of investment, wages and employment; all of which will only deepen the economic crisis.

The Budget offers a variety of tax concessions to private capital across the board. The biggest give away is the reduction of corporate taxes for companies with turnover between Rs 250 crores and Rs 400 crores, from 30 per cent to 25 per cent.

Apart from these, the BJP government has persisted in creating multiple rates of taxes, which it claims are incentives for private business to grow. Creating multiple rates of tax is above all against core principles of taxation as they create space for tax avoidance, tax evasion and tax fraud.

In the case of workers however, the BJP government believes that there must be standardisation and streamlining of labour laws into four codes. The BS does not shy away from the fact that these codes are not for workers but are in the interest of companies for whom things will easier for ‘registration and filing returns’.

The tax measures on capital gains and on ‘affordable’ housing are all aimed at allowing real estate developers and speculators off-load unsold stock without bearing existing tax liabilities.

The concessions granted to non-banking financial companies’ (NBFC) are unwarranted without significant enhancement of the prudential norms relating to them. In the absence of this, the easing of lending norms for public sector banks to lend to NBFCs is only likely to add further to the instability to the financial system.

Furthermore, the BS makes an aggressive commitment on privatisation of public enterprises through the ‘strategic sale’ route. This comes after five years of running down profit making PSUs by extraordinarily high dividends and draining their cash reserves.

The BS also promises to open up virtually all remaining sectors of the economy to 100 per cent foreign direct investment including aviation, insurance and media.

The BS makes claims on fighting manual scavenging, improving access to employment for women and expanding the opportunities for women’s self-employment.

In reality though, there have more deaths of manual scavengers in the last five years than ever before while rate of unemployment of women workers has doubled between 2014 and 2019. Like on everything else, the BS chooses not to reveal to us what the expected outcome of government’s efforts.

The sharpest decline in demand in our economy has been felt in rural areas. Under the BJP government, there has been a persistent attack on agricultural incomes and on wages of rural workers. The BS has nothing to offer the rural economy.

In 2017 the BJP government promised to double rural income in five years ie, by 2022. In today’s situation this would require rural incomes to rise by over 25 per cent year on year for the next three years in order to double. On how that might happen, the BS again remains silent.

How the BJP government will finance its spending plans also remains unaddressed. GST collections remain far below expectations while income tax revenues too have fallen short. The BS, meanwhile, proposes an additional Rs 1 tax on both diesel and petrol, contributing to the already existing burden of indirect taxes on the working class and the poor.

The Budget not only fails the peoples’ expectation but is intransparent and opaque on what the outcomes will be.

Leave alone providing urgent material relief to the working class and the poor, it provides no solution on how to pull back the economy from the precipice. The package of infrastructure investment rolled out through public-private partnerships and the private sector led industrial development do not add up.

How the economy might reach a seven per cent rate of growth as claimed by the BJP government’s Economic Survey 2018-19 released yesterday is a question mark?

Perhaps, and nothing says it better about the BJP government than its very own Economic Survey, which states that government should not worry about economic policy.

Instead, it says that government should understand how people behave and think, must have the capacity to respond to human behaviour and change how people behave and think. Bringing out the truth of what is the real situation we face is the challenge before our movement.

590,"U.S. is world's top waste producer, per capita amount 3 times of global average: research - Xinhua | English.news.cn","NEW YORK, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States is the world's top waste producer which creates three times the global average of trash, a new research on global garbage trends has shown.

According to the research's Waste Generation Index, which captures per capita rates of municipal solid waste, plastic, food and hazardous waste production, U.S. citizens and businesses are the largest contributors to the waste problem across the four indicators measured.

At 773 kg per head of population, the United States generates 12 percent of global municipal solid waste, while only accounting for 4 percent of the world's population.

In contrast, China and India make up over 36 percent of the global population, but generate 27 percent of global municipal waste.

While being the world's top waste producer, the United States is also one of the worst of any industrialized nation for managing its trash.

""The U.S. is the only developed nation whose waste generation outstrips its ability to recycle, underscoring a shortage of political will and investment in infrastructure,"" the research said.

According to the research, the country only recycles 35 percent of its municipal solid waste. In comparison, Germany, the world's most efficient country on waste management, recycles 68 percent of its municipal solid waste.

The country's lack of resolve to deal with waste domestically may become a mounting problem in the face of plastics import bans from many developing countries, the research warned.

""With the world's attention firmly fixed on the problem of waste, we expect governments to act, with businesses footing the bill,"" said Niall Smith, Senior Environmental Analyst at Verisk Maplecroft.

Investing in circular economy measures can not only mitigate risk but can open up new markets and improve brand reputation, the research added.

The study, conducted by risk management firm Verisk Maplecroft, found that over 2.1 billion tons of municipal solid waste are generated globally each year, enough to fill 822,000 Olympic-size swimming pools.

However, only 16 percent of the waste is recycled each year, while 46 percent is disposed of unsustainably, the research said.",China,2019.07

 “On the housing front, an additional deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh has been proposed on interest paid for affordable housing loans till March 2020. A model rental tenancy law will also be established to enhance the rental housing market. These measures, besides sustained investment in the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna will continue to support the housing market in the country.

 On the shadow banking sector, the government maintained a fine balance between ensuring liquidity and enhancing scrutiny. Placing housing finance companies under the ambit of the RBI and incentives such as credit guarantees for NBFCs will provide a relief to this sector. 

 Mahesh Misra, CEO-IMGC (India Mortgage Guarantee Corporation) 

 “While the RBI may not have directly regulated HFCs earlier, Banks contribute 58% of Housing Finance originations anyway. So, uniform sectoral regulation can have benefits. Smooth operational transition will be key given that several HFCs are newly incorporated and any slippages in an already tight environment could prove adverse. It is imperative for the housing sector to revive so that the economy can witness desired traction. NHB will continue to play a vital promotional role in that revival”.

 

 

 Sanjay Dutt, MD & CEO, Tata Realty & Infrastructure Limited 

 “ The allowance of FIIs and FPIs to subscribe to REITs and INVITs would lead to an influx of investment in the cash strapped sector. The government’s assurance to provide one-time credit guarantee for the first loss up to 10% for purchase of high rates pooled assets of financially sound NBFCs will further help the cause”. 

 Manoj Gaur, MD, Gaurs Group & Chairman, Affordable Housing Committee, CREDAI

 “CREDAI’s long standing proposals to reform archaic rental laws and promote public housing on government land figure have been among the immediate policy agenda outlined by the FM. With regulation of Housing Finance Companies returned from NHB to RBI, we hope that RBI would bring about much needed reforms for financing of real estate sector such as land, giving priority sector status to housing finance and lower cost of funding”.

 “The full Union Budget 2019-20 continues the government’s consistent approach towards affordable housing with more focus on increasing the carpet area, re-defining income criteria and giving infrastructure status under the PMAY. With its commitment towards affordable housing, the government aims to increase the number of beneficiaries in terms of the credit-linked subsidy scheme (CLSS).”

 Amit Modi, Director, ABA Corp and President (Elect), CREDAI Western UP

 “In spite of the positives of this budget, we feel that the government has missed the bus when it comes to millions of first-time middle class buyers who were looking forward to this budget before their first real estate purchase, the fact is that even a small 1-2bhk Apartment in Tier-1 Metro cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore will cost starting Rs 50 lakh and above and these urban buyers looking at ease of living in cities have been completely ignored in the process. Also the legitimate sector concerns, including industry status and online single window clearance, have been missed out in this budget. These steps in particular would have made a huge difference in transparency and turnaround time in delivery of housing to the masses across the country, while contributing towards the goal of Housing for All 2022.

 Dhruv Agarwala, Group CEO, Housing.com/Makaan.com/PropTiger.com

 “While it may seem like that there haven’t been any direct announcements to benefit the sector, the real story lies in the fine print. All the initiatives spoken of, to improve road, suburban railways and Metro connectivity; create a robust water management system; work on the Ease of Living; invest Rs 100 lakh crore in infrastructure over the next five years, will create more liveable cities and encourage people to invest in projects, even in peripheral areas and not overcrowd the CBDs and SBDs. On the regulatory side, we see the move to hand over regulation of housing finance companies to RBI, as a positive one. Another major area that has been addressed is Rental Housing – we look forward to the Model Tenancy Law that has been promised, to do away with the current archaic laws. The government’s clear focus on continuing to attract global investors into various sectors bodes well for the economy at large”.

 Ashish Bhutani, CEO, Bhutani Infra

 “With budget only catering to low cost housing, the middle class housing segment has been completely ignored. We expected the government to meet our long awaited demand of Single Window Clearance & Industry Status so as to smoothen the process under real estate”.

 Amit Raheja, CMD, Wealth Clinic

 “In terms of real estate and housing the move towards improving the current rental laws is a positive move. The need for such a reform is immediate, as the current mandate in rental is still unstable. Post the Infrastructure status designated to the affordable housing in the previous budget and now under PMAY (Urban), over 81 lakh houses with an investment of about Rs 4.83 lakh crore have been sanctioned of which construction has started in about 47 lakh houses. Additional deduction Rs 1.5 lakh on interest on loans will boost the buyer’s sentiment”.

 L.C Mittal, Director, Motia Group

 “In this budget the government has undertaken measures to provide impetus to the affordable segment of the society to realize its target to achieve housing for all by 2022 under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, but has not taken any major steps to incentivize the real estate sector and to aid the developers and upper and upper middle class segment of the economy”. 

 Nimish Gupta, MD South Asia, RICS. 

 “The Union Budget is balanced and looks to further improve economic and social fundamentals, which have been aided by improving on its ranking on ease of doing business, focusing on ease of living, along with policy agendas being driven by reform and transparency. Focus on rental housing can build on the agenda for ‘housing for all’ and add impetus to the residential market by increasing much needed housing supply. 

 Mahendra Singhi, President, Cement Manufacturers Association 

 “The cement industry extends its full support in realizing economic reforms through rapid growth in infrastructure across housing, rail, road, waterways and highways. Cement sector offers to further the circular economy practices on close partnership through Government support. The Budget balances the aspirations for growth of both business enterprise and rural India.”

 Rakesh Reddy, Director Aparna Constructions and Estates Pvt Ltd.

 “The real estate industry was very hopeful to receive infrastructure status this budget, however, this has been a big miss. Proposing 1.95 crore houses from FY 20-22 under PMAY may not attract many trusted players as the financing is very high as compared affordable housing segment. However, from the consumer point of view, increasing the interest deduction up to Rs 3.5 lakh for affordable housing loans for purchase of a house valued up to 45 lakh is an encouraging move”.

 Avneesh Sood, Director Eros Group

 “Placing housing finance corporation over the circle of the RBI and incentives such as credit guarantees for NBFCs will grant relief to this sector. Overall, the Budget is likely to boost domestic demand and support India’s economic outlook”.",India,2019.07
596,Tangshan Sanyou produces VSF from Re:newcell cotton,"Achieving milestone, China-headquartered Tangshan Sanyou Chemical Fiber has succeeded in producing viscose staple fibre made from 50 per cent post-consumer recycled cotton textiles, supplied by Swedish company Re:newcell. The remaining 50 per cent is made of Forest Stewardship Council chain of custody (FSC COC) wood pulp and audited by CanopyStyle.

This important milestone in the fashion industry’s transition to a circular economy is applauded by the environmental not-for-profit organization Canopy, which works collaboratively with 198 international apparel brands and retailers in search of such new innovative products. Canopy has collaborated with Tangshan Sanyou and Re:newcell for several years on sourcing solutions.

""Sanyou Chemical Fiber has been committed to providing sustainable fiber for textile industry chain with innovative technology. This cooperation with Re:newcell is a remarkable breakthrough in textile recycling field. Next, we will continue to provide more non-wood fiber solutions for brands,"" president of Tangshan Sanyou Chemical Fibre Co.Ltd, Zheng Baishan said.

Each year, 20 million tons of cotton textiles and 6.5 million tons of viscose textiles are consumed worldwide and converted into garments, beddings and personal care items such as wipes. The recycling process for cotton and its introduction into viscose fabric on an industrial scale is a new innovative technology and a timely breakthrough for the textile and fashion industries.

“This breakthrough proves that we don’t need to harvest virgin forests, cotton fields or oil wells to make high quality fashion materials at a big scale. Together, Tangshan Sanyou and Re:newcell have delivered what the fashion industry needs to make a transition to sustainability – a climate positive, low-impact and truly circular raw material. We will now work together with Tangshan Sanyou to build on this success and bring many thousands of tons of recycled materials to the market,” said Mattias Jonsson, CEO of Re:newcell.

This announcement has set a completely new bar for the viscose supply chain in its quest to be more sustainable and meet brands’ preference for fabrics made from post-consumer recycled textiles. It is a remarkable precedent; one that heralds a new era of climate solutions for brands and supply chain partners.

""The introduction of a new viscose fabric made from 50% recycled textiles represents an important leap forward for the global textile and fashion industries,” said Nicole Rycroft, Canopy's founder and executive director. ""We congratulate Sanyou and Re:newcell on these exciting results of their collaboration. They are setting a new bar in the development of Next Generation Solutions, one that brands and the broader market place eagerly await. (RR)",India,2019.07
632,US revealed to be the biggest driver of the world's waste crisis,"A new study has identified the United States—the nation where the idea of mass production was born—as the world’s top producer of waste while also being the worst among industrialised nations at managing it.

The US generates 12 per cent of global municipal waste—three times the global average—but only accounts for 4 per cent of the world’s population, reads the report, which was produced by Verisk Maplecroft, a United Kingdom-based research firm and consultancy specialising in global risk data and country risk analysis.

Worse still, of the staggering volumes of junk the country that created globalised consumer goods brand names such as Starbucks, McDonald’s and Coca-Cola as well as the Black Friday sales produces, only 35 per cent are adequately recycled, the study shows.

The research indicates that at 773kg per head, American citizens produce over three times as much waste as their Chinese counterparts, while municipal waste generation per capita is four times higher in the United States than in India.

But the US is not the only country that is bad at managing waste. While better than America at recycling, other industrialised countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands and Australia, are also disproportionately responsible for waste generation, the study shows.

Asia, often made the scapegoat for the world’s plastic crisis, has undoubtedly contributed to marine plastic pollution, but such criticism has neglected the fact that Asian nations have traditionally served as the world’s trash dumps, with industrialised countries shipping their waste to the region for recycling to prevent their homelands from getting swamped by the goods they discard.

According to the report, plastic waste flows have been directed at developing nations that tend to lack the resources to recycle adequately. What’s worse, such deliveries have often contained a mixture of various waste types, which make adequate recycling difficult if not impossible.

But, the study shows, this era is coming to an end. As waste importing countries, including Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia, are moving to limit the material they accept or ban it outright following China’s foreign waste ban 18 months ago, industrialised nations must find ways to reduce the rate at which they devour resources and deal with their own plastic waste rather than dumping it in the developing world.

Only recently, more than 100 containers of waste mislabelled as recyclable plastics Canada had shipped to the Philippines in 2013 and 2014 sparked a dispute between the two countries. It took threats of armed conflict from the Philippine government to pressure Canada to repatriate its waste in May this year.

Will Nichols, head of environment at Verisk Maplecroft, said given that awareness of the impacts of waste are at a peak, it was not surprising that countries in the region were moving to halt imports of waste.

“Although there are certainly concerns about the type of waste they are receiving from Europe and North America— often shipments are contaminated with difficult to recycle materials—these nations are realising they cannot continue to be the world’s dumping ground if they want to achieve their own environmental objectives,” he told Eco-Business.

Waste trade aside, domestic recycling rates in Southeast Asia are nothing to boast about. Nichols said: “With the exception of Singapore and Taiwan, our recycling index shows waste is handled pretty poorly in Southeast Asia.”

“Every other nation in the region disposes of at least a third of its waste inadequately. Myanmar, Vietnam, Indonesia and Philippines all mishandle over 80 per cent of their waste,” he said.

Verisk Maplecroft’s research identifies the Netherlands, the US and the United Kingdom as the countries where the introduction of new regulations on plastic waste could hit the companies that produce and use plastic in the pocket. But, Nichols observed, while many countries in Southeast Asia currently rank ‘low risk’, the amounts of waste these nations produce are on the rise as incomes increase.

“There is a perfect storm forming where countries are already unable to handle the waste they currently produce, but will soon have even more to deal with,” he said.

“Without major investment in infrastructure or rapid moves towards a more circular economy, we can expect a significant uptick in pollution, not just of rivers and soils, but increasingly the ocean too, where plastic particles present a severe threat to marine life,” he said.

A circular economy is a departure from existing modes production and consumption, implying that goods are repaired and recycled in order to minimise waste and ensure economic growth does not cost the earth.

Sumangali Krishnan, head of research and strategy for GA Circular, a Singapore-based consultancy devoted to finding business opportunities in post-consumer waste in Asia, told Eco-Business: “Southeast Asia is challenged given the limited capacity of existing waste management infrastructure.”

“Mismanaged waste – that is, uncollected or dumped waste due to limited waste management facilities – results in plastic pollution. Where collection exists, there is often limited source separation resulting in the limited or poor-quality collection of recyclables from household waste,” she said.

Southeast Asia’s recycling industry, she noted, is heavily reliant on an informal sector rather than the formal waste collection system. But, she adds, informal recycling systems could be vital in tackling the region’s mounting waste crisis.

Krishnan said: “The absence of complete diversion towards recycling combined with poor collection coverage has earned Southeast Asia the disrepute for plastic pollution. That said, the informal sector and recycling economy can definitely be harnessed to drive the collection of plastics for recycling and reduce pollution.”

The seeming lack of resolve of developed nations to address waste issues domestically may turn into a mounting problem and result in a myriad of risks to businesses in the face of bans on plastic imports, Verisk Maplecroft’s study finds.

While the discrepancy between what is produced and what is recycled creates challenges for governments and populations, it is companies deemed to be the key drivers of waste production that may find themselves footing the bill if they fail to address the issue, the study reads.

As waste generation in countries soars, governments are more likely to establish more stringent regulations to reduce the levels of resource consumption, the study reads.

Such regulatory measures present additional costs to businesses in countries with insufficient recycling infrastructure. Often, the study points out, responsibility has been passed to the private sector, with companies having to finance disposal facilities and processes.

Already, companies face growing domestic pressure to deal with waste, notably plastic, as more than 60 countries around the world are introducing legislation aimed at mitigating the use of single-use plastics such as plastic bags, according to the research.

In addition, elevated rates of waste generation can lead to direct resource constraints. Plastic pollution, for instance, has already heavily impacted marine ecosystems and disrupted both fishing and tourism industries.

With global attention firmly fixed on plastic pollution, businesses linked to waste issues also face reputational risks for the impacts of waste on ecosystem services, biodiversity and human health, the study said.

Branded bottles washing up on pristine beaches, for instance, do not reflect well on a company at a time when consumers increasingly express a preference for companies that operate responsibly.

To avoid brand damage and financial risks in the wake of regulatory action, companies must develop action plans to shift production patterns towards circular material flows, the report reads.

“Companies, especially those connected with the production and manufacture of plastics for packaging, can lead the way in identifying interventions to bolster the recycling industry,” Krishnan noted.

The world generates over 2.1 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste each year – enough to fill 822,000 Olympic-size swimming pools, according to the report, but only 323 million tonnes (16 per cent) are recycled and a staggering 950 million tonnes (46 per cent) are disposed of unsustainably, the research has found.

The dramatic increase in rates of waste generation in recent decades is the result of rapid urbanisation, population and economic growth coupled with unsustainable consumer behaviour, according to the report.

“As the waste crisis mounts, we will be spending a disproportionate amount of resources responding to the various health and environmental disasters and challenges. This is especially wasteful when we have the opportunity to not only prevent such crises but, with the implementation of circular economy solutions, actually build on the economic potential of plastic waste,” said Krishnan.",Singapore,2019.07
656,Why we need a circular economy,"Rwanda has a reason for opposing used clothes. Pushed by flawed trade regimes and myopic policies, these goods have nearly decimated the textile, apparel and leather industries in Africa. But elsewhere, a movement of sorts has gained momentum with celebrities urging consumers to choose second-hand clothes for a sustainable future.

""The textiles system operates in an almost completely linear way: large amounts of non-renewable resources are extracted to produce clothes that are often used for only a short time, after which the materials are mostly sent to landfill or incinerated,"" says a report by UK-based think-tank Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

Globally, clothing production doubled between 2000 and 2015. During the period, the number of garments purchased each year increased by 60 per cent but the average number of times a garment was worn before disposal declined by 36 per cent. More than $500 billion worth of natural resources are lost every year due to clothing underutilisation and the lack of recycling, says the report.

The volume and variety of natural resources that end up in landfill due to the take-make-disposal model are immense if one considers the diversification of the industrial economy and technological advancements. ""Some 65 billion tonnes of raw materials entered the economic system in 2010, and this figure is expected to grow to around 82 billion tonnes in 2020,"" says a 2014 report of the World Economic Forum.

Three planet Earths would be required to accommodate the gargantuan waste humanity would produce by 2050, warns environmental group, the World Wide Fund for Nature. Amid this impending crisis, the idea of a circular economy is fast catching up. A paper published in ScienceDirect in August 2018 says in the past five to 10 years, the concept has received significant attention at various levels. There has been a 50 per cent increase in academic publications on the circular economy in the past five years. Worldwide, governments, particularly those facing a growing crisis of raw materials, are making the concept an integral part of their policies.

Consider China. The world's most populous country is among the first to have realised the potential of circular economy as far back as in the 1990s. In 2008, the country adopted the Circular Economy Promotion Law and has established a commission which is responsible for planning and coordination of the circular economy. It monitors a scheme, Trade Old for Remanufactured, which aims to motivate citizens to recycle and reuse. Under the scheme, customers get a 10 per cent discount if they trade their old equipment for remanufactured items. Its 11th five-year plan has been drafted keeping in focus three R's—reduce, reuse, and recycle. In 2017, the government introduced Circular Economy Policy Portfolio which ensures that manufacturers focus on eco-friendly designs and remain responsible for collecting, transporting, recycling and responsibly disposing of the products at the end of their life.

Japan is the other Asian player which sees the circular economy as a mechanism to tide over resource constraints. It processes and reproduces its waste in such a way that 98 per cent of the metals gets recycled. Even 12 years ago, only five per cent of the waste ended up in landfills. In fact, in 2001, Japan was credited for introducing the first take-back law in the world, which forces retailers and manufacturers to take back used air conditioners, televisions, washing machines, and refrigerators. Under the law, consumers share the responsibility of manufacturers and the government to initiate the take-back process and pay a fee for collection and recycling of products. The law, though appears stringent, makes sense in a country whose volcanic and mountainous terrain offers limited space for landfills.

In Europe, Germany is the leader when it comes to sustainability goals. As per the Circular Economy Index prepared by media house The Politico, Germany recycles 65 per cent of its materials and sends 30 per cent to waste-to-energy plants. Only five per cent goes to landfills. The country, in fact, holds an estimated 1,260 patents that deal with sustainable products, processes, and services.

Global bodies like the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) are also promoting the circular economy through various events. In 2017, WEF and its partners established the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy, or PACE, to drive action towards a circular economy. Under PACE, over 50 business and government leaders have come together to create favourable conditions for widespread adoption of the concept. However, UNEP urges global leaders and think-tanks to expand the scope of the circular economy beyond just recycling products.

It points out that the value-retention processes (VRPs) like remanufacturing, refurbishment, repair, direct reuse and recycling can be complementary. In a report, it points out that VRPs create net-positive outcomes by enabling product-level efficiency gains in materials and energy use, as well as help control emissions and waste generation.

Remanufacturing and comprehensive refurbishment can contribute to reduced emissions by 79 to 99 per cent in many sectors. Remanufacturing can reduce new material requirement by 80 to 98 per cent. Comprehensive refurbishing saves more materials on an average, and it stands between 82 and 99 per cent. Repair saves an even higher share, between 94 and 99 per cent; and arranging direct reuse largely does not require any inputs of new materials. This can help us save gold, silver, indium, iridium, and tungsten which can near depletion very soon.

It now remains to be seen whether countries would see their used products as waste and dump on poorer countries or try to achieve resource efficiency for a sustainable future.",India,2019.07
660,Goyal stresses importance of circular economy,"Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal recently emphasised on the importance of circular economy at the 14th CII Sustainability Summit 2019.

Speaking at the event, Goyal stressed the importance of Circular Economy as the key component of sustainability.

He said that ‘keeping it simple with minimal resources’ has been the Indian ethos, which has been inculcated from our forefathers.

Out of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, Goal 12 particularly relates to responsible consumption and production. This must be looked at as a very serious commandment where industry leaders have a big role to play in the way people plan their lives.

He mentioned that Indian government has been at the forefront of the LED moment, which helped India bring down carbon footprint and led to lower electricity bills. It was based on affordable prices, which was later scaled up by the private sector.

He expressed that Indian Railways will be 100% electrified in 3-4 years, resulting in reduction of carbon emissions. In 10 years, it will run on 100% renewable energy, and there will be net zero emissions due to battery storage capability.

He stated that the concept of Circular Economy ensures that everything around us finds an effective value and non-usable waste is reduced to a bare minimum. According to a study, circular economy trajectory could bring annual benefits of ?40 lakh crore (USD 624 billion) by 2050.

He called out to youngsters and start-ups and said that the government is ready and willing to encourage any ideas that help us move towards a sustainable economy.

Acknowledging the dearth of natural resources and the consequences of the linear take-make-dispose model, which has consequences on environment, social inequity and climate change, Sanjiv Puri, Chairman, Advisory Council of CII-ITC Centre of Excellence for Sustainable Development Chairman and Managing Director, ITC Limited expressed that any resource not fully utilized can be deployed to make a purposeful contribution.

He further elaborated that a transition to a circular economy, a tectonic shift is required in the way we work today.

A holistic approach is needed to look at the whole value chain from production to consumption, to see how we can re-engineer this change.

Stating that resource efficiency and economic growth are linked, he mentioned that the economic organs of society, that is, businesses, can make this change and find solutions.

661,Are decentralised communities the way forward for sustainable cities?,"To realise the vision of a circular economy that reuses raw materials and minimises emissions and waste, it may be necessary to challenge the oft-cited projection that two-thirds of the world’s people will live in cities by 2050.

Different yardsticks for measuring a city’s progress may also be needed, said experts at an event organised by Eco-Business on Wednesday to discuss ways to keep resources in perpetual use.

“Do we really want to be using gross domestic product and consumption and income levels as measures of the progress and success of a city? Is that really how we keep cities and communities sustainable?” questioned Jacqueline Lam, deputy regional director for Southeast Asia and Oceania at C40, a network of megacities committed to addressing climate change.

Decentralisation could hold the key to creating communities that are self-sustaining in food production, water, energy and other areas, said Dr Sanjay Kuttan, executive director of the Singapore Maritime Institute and former programme director at Nanyang Technological University’s Energy Research Institute.

“I think we, for far too long, have accepted the fact that 70 per cent of the world’s population is going to be in cities by 2050, which is a bit ridiculous, considering cities occupy probably 3 per cent of the surface of the world. And that creates a lot of constraints and strain within the city,” he said.

“I hope the city of the future doesn’t look anything like what we have today, but is actually decentralised communities having their own self-sustaining food, energy and water resources, that are able to leverage technology to stay connected to the greater community at large,” Kuttan told an audience of about 100 senior executives and business decision makers.

More countries are going circular

The concept of a circular economy has been catching on in recent years, as more countries grapple with a growing waste problem and realise that the tall order of shifting away from the take-make-waste model and using as little new raw materials as possible has to start much earlier, at the planning and design stage.

Countries have also recognised the potential of the circular economy to boost global growth by US$4.5 trillion by 2030 and create high-value jobs.

Those that have come up with circular economy roadmaps include the Netherlands, Finland and Denmark. In Asia, Japan has a reputation for mapping the life cycle of materials—car buyers are required to pay a recycling fee—while in China, there is growing awareness of eco-design and a plan to make producers of certain goods responsible for them at the end of their useful lives.

Speakers at Eco-Business’ Cities | Possibilities: Building Circular Cities event included Khoo Teng Chye, executive director of the Centre for Liveable Cities, and the Netherlands’ Ambassador to Singapore and Brunei, Margriet Vonno.

Singapore has closed the loop when it comes to water—which it recycles and reuses—and land use planning, but is looking to do more when it comes to food, packaging and electronic waste, said Khoo. Industrial landlord JTC, together with consultants and other agencies, are also conducting a circular economy study on Jurong Island, the cornerstone of the country’s energy and chemicals industry.

Ambassador Vonno said the circular economy push requires government, innovators and citizens to work together.

One of the priorities identified in the Dutch manifesto is biomass and food, and Vonno said an industrial-scale solution in the Netherlands is a soup maker called Surplus Food Factory. Instead of channeling surplus food to animal feed and biofermentation, which the company felt to be a form of waste, it found a way to recover it for human consumption.

Other panellists spoke about circularity and ways to incur a smaller environmental footprint in building and construction and other industries.

Developers should minimise the use of new materials and think about how they can be reused at the end-of-life, said Maarten Schäffner, sustainability manager at engineering and consultancy firm Witteveen+Bos.

They should use indicators such as environmental life cycle assessment calculations or the percentage of reused materials in a project, and optimise design at each step of the process by comparing it with a baseline, said Schäffner, whose company is involved in the Jurong Island circular economy study.

A tool called material passports is useful for the circular economy because it enables engineers and developers to know exactly what buildings or structures are made of, paving the way for reuse and recycling. “Because right now, we are taking our buildings down after 20, 30 or 50 years of use, but most of the time we don’t know what’s in them anymore,” said Schäffner.

Property and infrastructure group Lendlease has been using engineered timber to construct some buildings, and its projects include the Forte residential apartments in Melbourne, Australia, and two office towers in Sydney.

Timber construction uses far fewer materials compared to concrete, said Richard Paine, managing director of Paya Lebar Quarter, a Lendlease mixed-use development in Singapore.

“Your building weight is roughly a quarter of what it is for a normal building and that means your foundations don’t need to be as deep or heavy,” he said. Parts of the building can also be prefabricated offsite before being put together at the construction site, which generates less traffic and noise.

Good design and working towards zero-waste or carbon-neutral goals at each step of the process are important. For instance, as the world pushes for greater adoption of renewable energy to curb carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, project developers need to think about the design of such infrastructure, so that solar panels and energy storage systems can be redeployed or reused when they are decommissioned, said Kuttan.

“Developing sustainably is really a fundamental challenge for all cities today,” said Khoo. “How cities adapt to a slew of disruptions arising from climate change, resource constraints, social shifts and new technologies will be critical to their liveability and sustainability.”",Singapore,2019.08

668,Toyota group opens plant for recycling car batteries,"Toyota Motor Thailand has opened a battery life cycle management plant in Chachoengsao, the first overseas facility outside Japan, to circulate batteries of hybrid cars sold in Thailand.

The new facility is a partnership with Toyota subsidiaries and affiliates, comprising Toyota Daihatsu Engineering & Manufacturing (TDEM), Toyota Motor Asia-Pacific, Toyota Tsusho Thailand, Denso Thailand and Siam Waste Management.

The facility is run by TTK Logistics Thailand, a subsidiary of Toyota Tsusho, and is located adjacent to Toyota's passenger car plant and battery assembly plant in Chachoengsao.

Ninnart Chaithirapinyo, chairman of Toyota Motor Thailand, said the facility supports local sales of hybrid cars.

Hybrid cars are the lowest level of technology for electric vehicles, in which the batteries need to be circulated and managed in a 3R scheme (rebuild, reuse and recycle).

Mr Ninnart declined to provide a budget for the facility, saying only that the plant will have capacity to rapidly diagnose 10,000 units a year and recycle 20,000 units a year.

He said Toyota started to sell hybrid cars in Thailand in 2009, with 5,000-6,000 batteries exported to Belgium a year under the 3R scheme.

""This facility will serve not only Toyota's hybrid cars, but also batteries from other brands and electric devices,"" Mr Ninnart said. ""We are in talks with relevant companies to provide our services.""

After the rapid diagnostic process, the high-efficiency modules will be reassembled and sold as alternative hybrid rebuilt batteries at one-third the price of new batteries.

The moderate-efficiency modules still capable of storing electric charge are reused for energy storage to reserve and supply energy for buildings, factories and charging stations.

The low-efficiency modules, both nickel metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries, will be sent to recycling then shipped back to Japan to produce new hybrid batteries.

Mr Ninnart said Toyota has studied the circular economy concept for two years and is using operating methods developed in Aichi prefecture under Toyota Energy Solutions and Primearth EV Energy.

Toyota was the first to bring hybrid models to market in Thailand, with roughly 78,000 such cars sold as of August.

In 2019, Toyota forecasts sales of all EVs at 36,000 cars, of which 19,000 are expected to be hybrid versions.

Toyota has spent 19 billion baht on hybrid car production in Thailand, with plans to assemble 7,000 hybrid cars a year, make 70,000 batteries and produce 9.1 million units of other parts at the Gateway plant in Chachoengsao.",Thailand,2019.08
675,Here's what could go wrong with the circular economy—and how to keep it on track,"The circular economy—one that breaks the link between economic growth and use of limited resources and also cuts waste from the system—is on the minds of corporate sustainability professionals, governments and researchers. We are all excited about its potential to increase economic prosperity, derive more value from products and reduce emissions.

But in the rush to realise the promise of a circular economy, we need to think through the possibility of unintended consequences.

Will the jobs generated by circular innovations be better jobs? Who will get them? Circularity could reduce material extraction and waste through reuse—but at the cost of what other resources? Will circularity reduce consumption, or just maximise use of existing products?

The circular economy is not a silver bullet for employment, sustainability and prosperity. Companies and governments must carefully measure the anticipated and actual impact of these actions and ensure they take us in the right direction—not into a circular but even less sustainable future.

Here are three ways to do just that.

Circularity could fundamentally change the employment landscape, similar to the disruption technology has brought. Research indicates that the circular economy will provide new jobs, with the recycling industry alone already employing more than 1.5 million people worldwide.

A 2015 report by WRAP and the Green Alliance looking at the role of the circular economy in revving up a lackluster United Kingdom jobs market estimated that 500,000 new jobs would be created in the UK alone by 2030.

A study by Cambridge Econometrics, Trinomics and ICF concluded that shifting from virgin extraction to repair in the European Union would add 700,000 jobs, mainly in central and eastern Europe.

However, these employment changes come at a cost. For example, in a world that relies less on virgin material extraction, there will be fewer mining jobs. According to the 2018 ILO report, while 18 million new green jobs are projected to be created by 2030, extracting and refining petroleum will lose one million.

Measuring impact is a first step to addressing potential repercussions for those who lose from the transition. But as much as quantification is a challenge in environmental topics, in social issues it is even more complex and often subjective. For example, the jobs created by the circular economy may be different from existing jobs in scope and location.

Perhaps repair will create more creatively fulfilling roles than mass production, but in an economy that values refurbishment over mass production, work may move closer to the consumer, potentially causing dislocation in regions that can least afford the job losses.

Such topics are hard if not impossible to capture in a single metric, but that shouldn’t keep companies and governments from assessing the consequences of these actions.

2. Compare waste reduction against the resource impact of recycling

Zero waste and 100 per cent circularity have become popular goals—but achieving them can be surprisingly resource-intensive and could lead to actions that compromise overall sustainability.

For example, buying a plastic or steel can of coffee beans may seem like a better environmental choice than composite-material coffee bags because the cans, unlike the bags, can be recycled. But plastic cans take more than 5 megajoules of energy per 11.5 OZ volume to produce; steel, more than 4; but the bag, a little over 1.

In fact, purchasing products based only on what is recyclable is a misguided way to make buying decisions. Recycling itself requires resources: paper must be reduced to pulp and reformulated with water, chemicals and energy. Metals are shredded or melted, requiring energy, before being reconstituted.

Recycling is only worthwhile from a resource perspective if the resources required for recovery and recycling are less than those required for extraction and disposal. Some have even suggested that the circular economy could result in resource depletion if not carefully implemented.

Perhaps zero waste should not be society’s ultimate aim. We need more research and impact-based metrics to understand the total effect of circularity on companies’, countries’ and even citizens’ sustainability efforts and identify the optimum recycling rate for each material.

One often-touted benefit of circularity is that it will reduce consumption of brand-new products. Since we published the paper The Elephant in the Boardroom, companies are more willing to discuss the challenge of endless growth in consumption, but we still have a long way to go. Circular economy can hinder as well as help the situation.

Lower consumption will only be realised if we value longevity and reuse over the purchase of virgin material-based goods. That message has not yet been fully adopted by businesses, even those that are starting to understand the appeal of circular economy. A prominent fast fashion apparel company carries in many of its U.S. stores two prominent messages, often on adjacent boards.

One reminds us to “rewear, reuse and recycle”—but right next to it is an equally prominent sign that reads “We have new stuff coming in every day, so why don’t you?”

The phenomenon calls to mind the Jevons paradox: increasing efficiency doesn’t lead to less consumption—it leads to more. In this case, the consumer feels good about resource savings in one area (contributing to the circular economy by donating old clothes), allowing them to rationalise using more resources in another (restocking the closet with new purchases).

Companies must measure their impact on resources and set science-based targets that bound corporate actions within the confines of the planet’s resources. This will lead to new business models for growth and the associated change in consumer thinking that is not predicated on selling more new stuff.

Circularity can be an effective way to achieve the transformation we need to make sustainable use of the planet’s resources. But pursuing circularity as an end in itself gives us a false sense of security and could even drive worse outcomes.

To avoid this, we need metrics that keep us focused on the impacts we seek, together with targets that ensure we stay within the safe operating space and don’t venture beyond the ability of the planet to support society. Businesses and governments alike must implement circularity with deliberation and caution in order to optimise its impact and help society reap the benefits.

690,Puma partners with Goonj to promote circular economy,"Global sports company Puma is partnering with Goonj, an India based non-profit company specialising in using urban surplus to trigger grassroots development work. In an effort to promote a circular economy, Puma is encouraging its customers to contribute their gently used apparel and footwear at Puma stores and on its website from August 22 – September 10.

For this initiative, collection boxes will be set up at over 360 exclusive Puma stores across the country. Consumers also have an option to arrange for a pick up by submitting a simple request form on Puma's website. For every contribution made in-store or online, they will be gratified with Puma gift vouchers, said Puma in a press release.

At the end of the campaign, the collection will be consolidated and dropped at Goonj's processing centres across India where Goonj teams will put the material through a rigorous process of sorting, segregating, repairing and packing. Customised kits will then be prepared for specific local needs of people in different parts of the country - like family kits, school kits, rahat disaster relief kit, aaganwadi kit, labour kit and menstural dignity kits. In the remote rural villages, these kits will act as a mobilising and motivating tool to reward people who work on their own issues like building a bamboo bridge, digging a well, building community spaces etc.

""We are happy to partner with Goonj towards their efforts to uplift rural communities. This initiative gives us a great platform to collaborate with our consumers to crowdsource essentials like apparel and footwear. We will continue to actively be a part of the circular economy and encourage more people to make a conscious choice towards sustainable living,"" said Abhishek Ganguly, managing director, Puma India.

""This partnership with Puma, presents a great example of how different entities can collaborate to bring awareness on the development issues and how by creating such platforms, people from all across get a chance to participate. We hope the customers take this as an opportunity not for clearing old material but by giving only what can be used as more than the giving, mindful giving matters. And at Goonj, recipient does not get it as charity, but it is given in a very dignified manner,"" said Anshu Gupta, founder director, Goonj. (PC)",India,2019.08

759,SCG takes on circular economy for today's business,"It is impossible to turn a blind eye to the environment crisis the world is facing today.

One of the most appalling environment-related tragedies was the recent death of the female dugong Mariam, whose autopsy later found several pieces of plastic in her intestine. Issues such as global warming, climate change, and excessive waste all pose a challenge to how global companies should operate and cause difficulties for businesses in their environmental policies. With increasing demand for limited world resources, sustainable development is key to surviving and thriving in this age.

The Circular Economy is a new economic business model and a solution to the current environmental situation. It offers a new way of looking at relationships between markets, customers and natural resources. At the same time it harnesses the potential of emerging disruptive technologies to move from “Take-Make-Dispose” toward “Make-Use-Return”.

Roongrote Rangsiyopash, President and CEO of SCG said:

“The traditional Linear Economy is based on the one-way Take-Make-Dispose process without recycling

obligations. This model produces many negative impacts at a global scale which prompts the world to change. Meanwhile, the Circular Economy is a regenerative economic system applied across the value chain to increase management efficiency of waste, raw materials, end-of-life products, and energy to circulate continuously in a proper closed loop system.

“The goals and guidelines of the Circular Economy are to maximise the value of resources while minimising the use of new resources. This is accomplished by creating a series of circular approaches ranging from re-process, re-design, added value, innovation, collaboration with business and non-business related and reuse. The model is all about building better values and a more sustainable environment, community, society, and business.”

Right now, the Circular Economy is not a business option but has become the necessary key to sustainable development and business. Implementation of the Circular Economy will pave the way for new business opportunities to mitigate business risks today and in the future. It helps businesses sharpen their competitive edge and prosper. The model will eventually lead to reduced resource dependence and create value for organisations and stakeholders.

Most importantly, the key to achieving these sustainable development goals that include economic, societal and environmental dimensions requires the active participation of all sectors.

“More public awareness and behavioural transition in manufacturing and consumption to regenerative practices must occur along every value chain,” concluded Mr Roongrote. “Only with the cooperation can the Circular Economy become a reality.”

All in all, it is more important than ever to familiarise Thai society with and make the most of Circular Economy policies and practices.

To help all this come to fruition, SCG is proud to host “SD Symposium 10 Years — Circular Economy : Collaboration for Action”, providing Thailand with a platform to brainstorm and work together toward the most suitable Circular Economy solution in the Thai context.

The symposium takes place on 26 August 2019 at Centara Grand and Bangkok Convention Centre at

785,Circular economy hype builds,"With the circular economy model moving from buzz to business and trade strategy, the Commerce Ministry has pledged to beef up promotion and campaigns for the circular economy to reduce waste and increase value-added production.

According to Banjongjitt Angsusingh, director-general of International Trade Promotion Department, the Commerce Ministry through her department will start the campaigns with housing and decorative items and then move onto products made from agricultural raw materials.

Farm products can be used not only as food but also raw materials for industrial products such as cosmetics, she said.

As parts of the efforts, the department will add more products developed under the circular economy concept to be sold at the Style Bangkok 2019, the biannual lifestyle product trade fair to be held in October at Bitec, Bangna.

The department earlier organised trade fairs related to the circular economy in leading department stores such as the Eco Creative Design at Central Department Store and Designers' Room & Talent Thai fair at Siam Discovery.

A circular economy is an economic system aimed at eliminating waste through the continual use of resources. Circular systems employ recycling, refurbishment and reuse manufacturing to create a closed system, minimising the use of resource inputs and the creation of waste.

Speaking at the ""Circular Economy for a Changing World"" forum held by the Commerce Ministry in commemoration of 99 years since the ministry's establishment, Pipat Apiruktanakorn, the owner of social enterprise Kidkid Co, said the circular economy is an important trend, with many private companies listed in the stock markets becoming more concerned with social responsibility and starting to improve their production methods to reduce costs and improve quality of life.

""This is the time for cooperation between government agencies and the private sector to promote a circular economy as waste needs to be managed effectively,"" he said, adding the Commerce Ministry should raise awareness among consumers by marketing the circular economy.

Mr Pipat said his company created the ECOLIFE app through a partnership with 30 leading universities and many companies such as Siam Cement Group, Nestle, PTT, Samsonite, Siam Commercial Bank and Ikea to reduce the use of plastic.

He also urged the government to come up with incentives for companies, traders and merchants who agree to reduce waste.

Thammasak Jittimaporn, chief operating officer of Mitr Phol Group, said incidents such as the death of baby dugong Marium will be repeated indefinitely as Thailand does not have measures to reduce waste.

Mr Thammasak said the private sector is calling for incentives from the government, particularly for R&D and technology, to address environmental problems.",Thailand,2019.08
823,BRICS nations come together for Urban Environmental Management,"Acknowledging the importance of urban environmental management for improving quality of life in cities, the Environment Ministers of BRICS countries on Friday agreed to work together to resolve the multifaceted environmental issues faced by BRICS cities.

These discussions and announcements were made during the 5th BRICS Minister of Environment Meeting which was preceded by a two-day meeting of BRICS Joint Working Group on Environment.

Highlighting the path-breaking work done by India in achieving its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) Union Environment Minister, Prakash Javadekar, said: ""India under the dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is walking the talk on NDC's.""

He added, ""We have achieved reducing energy intensity by 25% and already 78GW of renewable energy has been made possible, while at the same time forest cover has increased by nearly 15,000 sq km and tree cover outside the forest is increasing rapidly.""

Stressing the key role played by BRICS countries the minister said ""BRICS is a very good platform for all five countries for co-operation and development. All five countries are rising and have many experiences to share and these experiences will definitely help all the economies to improve further in our climate action efforts and protecting environment while ensuring growth at the same time.""

In a tail of ministerial meetings, the minister iterated that India has set an example in achieving its NDC's and all countries need to walk the talk.

The Ministerial Declaration highlighted key initiatives - Partnership on Urban Environmental Sustainability Initiative (PUESI) to share knowledge and experience on important issues as waste management, cogeneration, reverse logistics, sanitation, urban air quality, urban green areas, BRICS

Environmentally Sound Technology (BEST) Cooperation Platform for innovations, knowledge sharing and capacity building, and Clean River of BRICS program for improvement of river ecology and combating marine litter.

Environment Ministers agreed to establish and strengthen concrete mechanisms of implementation of the cooperation initiatives with a special focus on action-oriented cooperation.

The key themes of urban environmental management, contaminated areas and soil remediation, water quality, circular economy in the context of sustainable consumption and production, marine litter and biodiversity were agreed to be integrated into BRICS cooperation initiatives.

While applauding the initiatives of BRICS countries and reaffirmed India's support to BRICS cooperation, the minister highlighted key initiatives as Swachh Bharat Mission, Waste Management Rules, Nationally Determined Contributions under Paris Agreement, National Clean Air Programme, electric mobility, marine litter, urban forestry scheme, development of resource efficiency policy among others.

With respect to biodiversity, BRICS countries stand committed to support the development of the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework and expect the prospective framework to acknowledge the sustainable use of biodiversity and Access and Benefit Sharing components.

The Ministers of BRICS countries urged developed countries to fulfil their commitment under the UNFCC and its Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement to provide means of implementation to developing countries including climate finance, technology development and transfer and capacity-building support.

BRICS countries reaffirmed the importance of jointly exploring new sources of financing individual, bilateral and multilateral projects while highlighting access to financial resources as key to tackling environmental problems in the developing world.

892,Sustainability: The Key To Future Business Growth,"Businesses across the globe have recognized that embracing sustainability is no longer a choice. They realize that they need to be mindful of their operations in order to maintain overall profitability.

Climate change is one of the most imminent threats that has unprecedented implications on how people live, work and play. Changes in temperature and weather patterns, and the rising sea levels are putting the existing ecosystem at risk. Corporates and the civil society need to be collectively aware of and own the changes immediately. With enhanced globalization in recent times, the concept of Sustainability has graduated from being a support function to becoming the nucleus of a profitable enterprise.

Sustainable development is the need of the hour

Ever wondered as to what has led to this shift in businesses pursuing meaningful business profitability? What has transpired behind the scenes of this dynamic digital age that has forced the leaders to review their strategies and ensure that they do what they are doing in a more responsible way? Well, the answer is simple - “There is no business on a dead planet”.

The rise in population and the subsequent increase in the demand for energy resources and supplies has led to serious environment concerns. Waste creation and disposal have also become a major challenge for civilizations to survive. With the issue of climate change looming large and increased pressure on limited natural resources, more organizations are embracing sustainable business practices to maintain their overall long-term growth.

Increased focus on people, planet, profit = New possibilities for the future

With an astute focus on people, planet and profitability, sustainability is all about meeting the requirements of the current generation as well as facilitating the future for the upcoming ones. Going beyond purely financial conversations, this concept of Triple Bottom Line focuses on the development in the social and environmental value of a business, thus opening many possibilities to re-imagine the future.

In a circular system, resource input and waste, emission, and energy leakage are minimized.

Organizations and management have to look towards new ways of operations that focus on optimal inputs usage, energy and resource usage, recycle and reuse the waste that is generated. To achieve that, organizations will need the right skills in design, more dependence on IT and new business models. Cross-sector collaborations are also required to create dynamic usage of waste for one sector as inputs to other processes and sector.

With digital being at the core of every business today, there is immense opportunity for IT to make a positive impact across all industries.

Digital revolution or evolution is adding more technological armaments in the hands of people, cities and organizations to look at creative ways to save energy and fuel consumption and waste management. People are adopting car sharing apps that are is reducing per capita fuel utilization. Organizations are adopting robotic process automation to make processes faster and paperless.

New digital innovations like artificial Intelligence have the potential to save the planet. A new field of ‘climate informatics’ is coming up that uses the phenomenal power of AI to understand the impact of climate change and impact of human interventions on bio-diversity. It can be used to develop smart agriculture by apt crop selection, smart distribution of fertilizers and pesticides based on demand.

Electric and autonomous vehicles will save our planet from excessive fuel consumption and carbon emissions.

The new call-to-action for companies undergoing digital reinvention therefore is to consider environment and social welfare factors right at the strategy and planning stage and extend the scope of sustainability practices beyond traditional IT operations.

Green IT: Way towards sustainability

According to a recent report, information and communications technology (ICT) devices, such as IT-enabled smart grids and buildings have the potential to deliver a 20% reduction in global carbon emissions by 2030, and over $11 trillion in new economic benefits.

Data centers globally are one of the biggest contributors to CO emissions. Companies today are thereby adopting ‘Green IT solutions’ like virtualizations, star rated equipments, and electronic waste management towards saving their carbon emissions. There is lot more that we can do:
• Buy energy efficient products, use sensors across the organization to measure consumption
• Change printer configurations to use less paper and ink
• Encourage employees to use telecommuting, teleconferencing and video conferencing technologies

In the long run, entrepreneurs with a keen business sense and an intent for eco-innovation (inventions that help solve environment issues) will reap the rewards. As per an industry report, companies with a focus on eco-innovation are growing at an annual rate of 15% at a time when many competitors remain flat.

Social entrepreneurs are a common man’s advocates who leverage the power of market forces and business principles to solve social problems in ways that benefit the marginalized. Social warriors outline a compelling thought that businesses can be a suitable vehicle to create economic value as well as build a fair and equitable society.

It's time for all hands on the deck

Everyone has a role to play in shaping a sustainable future and each one of us needs to do their bit in securing our shared resources and solving the climate change puzzle. Increased collaboration between the government and the private and public sectors can help break down barriers to sustainable growth.

What matters today is the way businesses build their successes in sustainable practices and initiatives to pursue similar improvements across new digitized processes and business models. This requires industry-wide collaborations with partners across the value chain.

916,Textile industry growing eco-conscious to demand consumer demand of sustainability,"From a factory standpoint, it’s also a matter of asking whether they’re solar-powered and how much water they use. (Photo: AP)

Washington: Whether it’s how they’re made or what they’re made of, textiles are evolving to meet consumer demand for sustainability. “There’s a real push for sustainability now, and the home textiles industry is waking up to that consumer call,” says Shannon Maher, chair of Home Products Development at the Fashion Institute of Technology, in New York.

It’s about reducing waste during textile production, she said, and reusing or recycling waste to produce other products. “Zero Waste has definitely become a watchword,” she said. Consumers today have a heightened awareness of the harm plastic does to the environment, and “are willing to pay 5 or 10 per cent more for a sustainable product as a way of contributing to the circular economy, and helping the environment,” she says.

Rugs and outdoor fabrics, for instance, are increasingly being made with recycled materials instead of new plastics. A lot is happening on the fashion-design front, too, to explore new, sustainably sourced and even compostable types of textiles.

“Companies like Adidas and Nike are at the cutting edge of some of these innovations, and their work — and innovations in textiles used for apparel — does trickle down to textiles in other realms,” Maher says.

An exhibit of textile innovations at the Cooper Hewitt Design Museum in New York City, on view through Jan. 20, includes a dress made by a Japanese design team that features naturally glowing silk, made from silkworms injected with a green fluorescent protein derived from jellyfish. There’s a prototype for Adidas sneakers made entirely of ocean plastic; another prototype of sneakers that would be entirely compostable; and a textile made from algae.

“There’s a level of optimism when you look around and see designers really taking on the challenge of all this,” says Andrea Lipps, a curator at the Cooper Hewitt who helped organise the exhibit. “There’s a groundswell of creativity that’s continuing to reverberate.”

At the Fashion Institute of Technology, students have been experimenting with using milkweed and flax to create luxurious “fur” from 100 per cent plant material. That won them the Stella McCartney Prize for Sustainable Fashion at the Biodesign Challenge Summit earlier this summer.

Another student design team there came up with the idea for a Spandex-type elastic fabric using a protein found in oysters. To help companies get the word out about steps they’re taking, and help consumers identify environmentally responsible companies, the Sustainable Furnishing Council provides an online list.

“We have about 400 member companies, and they each have made their own public and verifiable commitment to sustainability,” says Susan Inglis, executive director of the council. Look up, say, garden furniture, and see what best practices various manufacturers have put in place.

Another effort to help consumers reliably identify more eco-friendly companies is a new level of Oeko-TEX certification, called “Made in Green,” certifying that no harmful chemicals have been used in the manufacture of a certain product.

“People are talking more these days about ‘the value chain,’ showing that not only are you certified as being environmentally responsible, but all of the factories in your production process are certified. It’s a level of transparency that includes aspects like using clean energy sources,” explains Maher.

“Sustainability is complex,” she says. From a factory standpoint, it’s also a matter of asking whether they’re solar-powered, and how much water they use.",Singapore,2019.08

25,Greening our cities is crucial to the future of the planet - Taipei Times,"Greening our cities is crucial to the future of the planet

As global leaders gathered in New York City for the UN Climate Action Summit last week, it was important to remember that cities are not just convenient settings for our coexistence and dialogue, but also leading sources of greenhouse-gas emissions.

As hubs of employment, trade and innovation, cities are the engines of our economic growth, accounting for more than 80 percent of global GDP. By mid-century, more than 6 billion people — almost 70 percent of the world’s population — will live in urban areas, up from about 4 billion today.

Yet cities already use more than two-thirds of the world’s resources and energy, accounting for more than 70 percent of carbon dioxide emissions. As cities continue to grow, so will these numbers. Between 2011 and 2013, China used more cement in cities development than the US did during the entire 20th century.

The future of our planet, then, depends on how we manage urban development.

In addition to being the biggest contributors to climate change, cities are also among the most at risk, and thus have the most to gain from going green.

With 90 percent of the world’s urban areas on coastlines and at risk from rising sea levels, there is significant work to be done to protect the bulk of the world’s population from these and other climate-related threats.

Cities are where spending on climate action would have the biggest impact. Making cities more compact, connected and coordinated around green policies could yield economic savings of up to US$17 trillion by 2050.

For starters, we must do far more to reduce energy consumption, harmful emissions and air pollution, not least by improving energy efficiency in urban areas.

Given that urban infrastructure is hard to change quickly (and lasts a long time), the time for a new conversation about urbanization is now.

Cities need to develop plans to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, build resilience and involve all relevant sectors of the economy in the shift toward clean energy. Policymakers should be planning for adaptations to existing infrastructure and new long-term investments.

Many cities around the world are already integrating climate goals into their urban-development plans. Copenhagen has emphasized increasing its buildings’ energy efficiency. Bangalore is investing in sustainable transport, and, among other good examples, Mexico City is focused on strengthening the resilience of its most vulnerable residents to extreme weather events.

A growing number of cities have come to realize that climate-friendly policies have immediate benefits in terms of both quality of life and economic growth.

Green investment makes economic sense, because it tends to result in better municipal services, cleaner air and safer water. Indeed, solar energy is now often cheaper than fossil fuels, and plastic recycling — a key to cleaning up our oceans — is a source of steady jobs.

However, cities also need to go further, by recognizing the benefits of a circular economy that minimizes waste.

“The 15 circular steps for cities,” a guide from the European Investment Bank (EIB), shows that cities and their residents have much to gain — including a smaller carbon footprint — from reduced consumption and reuse of resources.

Around the world, international development banks are providing cities with financing and technical assistance for climate-related projects.

For the EIB, the priorities are energy efficiency, renewables, and sustainable transport.

At the same time, governments need to introduce new regulations and offer bigger incentives to get projects off the ground, and to encourage more innovation among businesses.

To that end, we need all stakeholders to be connected and on the same page. City networks such as C40 Cities, Local Governments for Sustainability (better known as ICLEI) and the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy offer a good starting point.

These groups have the power and influence to get the right people around the same table, discussing concrete policies.

For its part, the EIB and the Global Covenant of Mayors have joined forces to help cities finance climate action and build greener cities for future generations.

Under this new partnership, we launched the Global Climate City Challenge a year ago to provide technical assistance that helps prepare and fast-track the financing of urban climate action projects.

After soliciting 145 climate-policy ideas from more than 100 cities around the world, we have selected 20 proposals involving a total investment potential of 1.4 billion euros (US$1.53 billion).

By extending technical assistance and financing for climate projects to cities in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the EU, the program will create jobs, cut energy bills, improve air quality, strengthen the management of waste and wastewater, and build resilience.

To address the critical lack of grant funding necessary to advance projects to a stage where they are ready for feasibility analysis and ultimately investment, the City Climate Finance Gap Fund was launched during the UN Climate Action Summit. It aims to raise more than 100 million euros in grants in order to unlock at least 4 billion euros in projects.

Government and financial leaders who met in New York City should bear in mind that they are not alone. They have the support of a growing global community of mayors, local officials and private-sector leaders who are determined to usher in greener cities for all citizens. Our task is to ensure that these voices are heard.

LSJH is currently running a pilot processing plant that aims to accelerate the textile circular economy. Sorting of waste textiles is a manual process now.Recognition technology based on an infrared sensor is familiar in sorting plastic packaging, but it is new in textile recycling, according to LSJH project engineer Jaakko Zitting, who was part of the team that developed the technology.The goal is to create a facility that will be able to use the new infrared sensor to process all discarded textiles from Finland as well as textile waste from abroad, according to a report by a Finnish public service media company.So far waste textiles have been manually sorted in Finland as well as in other parts of Europe. This means that workers check labels to identify different kinds of materials. However labels can be inaccurate or may even be missing at times. This becomes problematic given that industries using recycled fibres to manufacture new products need to be certain of the raw material they are using.The optical recognition technology under development will improve the reliability of identification of fibres in fabrics and will help ensure better quality textile products, LSJH said in a statement.The technology will be deployed this autumn. Different fibres will be used for different products, with better quality material reserved for thread that could be used to manufacture new clothing. Recycled fibre can also be used for purposes such as composite products or even insulation material.Textile recycling is only possible if the entire textiles value chain is aligned with the circular economy, i.e., if recycled fibres are used to bring new products to the market. It is therefore of utmost important to find new businesses that want to utilise recycled fibres to develop new products, said LSJH project leader and circular economy specialist Sini Ilmonen.Funding for the processing plant was provided by municipal waste facilities and the Ministry of employment and economy. Additionally, public funding agency Business Finland contributed a €1.5-million investment grant. (DS)",India,2019.09
124,Javadekar reaffirms India’s want to grow ‘sustainably’,"India will grow sustainably and at the same time ensure its citizens get the benefits of development, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar told a United Nations forum here.

Speaking at the ‘setting the context for the industry transition’ programme at the Climate Action Summit here on Saturday, Javadekar underscored Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Zero Defect Zero Effect’ model where no products have defects and their production has no adverse effects on the environment.

“My country is on (a) growth trajectory. I can’t deny justice to my people (of wanting to develop). We want to grow sustainably,” Javadekar said.

The Climate Action Summit here, hosted by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, aims to boost action to implement the 2016 Paris Agreement. It will focus on nine interdependent tracks, which will be led by 19 countries and aided by international organisations.

The coalition on transforming industry is being led by India and Sweden.

Javadekar said the nine tracks will help nations in efforts to achieve the goals set under the Paris Agreement.

The minister told the forum that carbon capture and storing has been discussed for years, but it has not fructified to the extent it should have.

He said in a first a campus is coming up in India which will capture carbon. “There will be carbon emission which will be trapped and used as raw material in other factories. That is a big thing,” he said.

Javadekar elaborated on India’s six-dollar-a-ton carbon tax, calling it a carrot and stick policy.

“So the industry starts thinking in the way of how we can avoid coal consumption and how we can come up with other solutions,” he said, adding India is probably the only country with such a policy.

The minister said the lowest carbon emission cement industry is in India.

He lauded the improvements made in India’s cement sector, especially in process technologies, more efficient raw material blending, high efficiency classified files, improved process control and management systems, better raw material selection.

He said the Indian aviation industry was fast switching to biofuels.

“Our first successful flight from Dehradun to Delhi flew on biofuel ethanol. We are making more progress in that direction,” he said.

The minister said now plans were afoot to fly Boeing planes with biofuel and “we will succeed I’m very sure”.

Javadekar said energy intensity (the measure of energy inefficiency) in the country has been brought down and that the results were for all to see.

Later, he elaborated on the national policy of resource efficiency and circular economy concept.

He said there is tremendous push by the Indian government on e-mobility and is giving related tax concessions.

He said Euro 6 compliant vehicles will be in the market by April 2020.

“It’s a huge investment in fuel. So, we are moving around with really ambitious targets. And we are on the road,” he said.

Use of better quality inputs have resulted in gradual reduction of energy consumption in the steel sector as well, he said.

He said the government’s 'Perform, Achieve and Trade' initiative has covered 478 energy intensive industries.

The minister said many Indian industries are part of the carbon disclosure project and have begun adopting science-based targets.

He said these examples of public policy intervention and public private partnerships have been successful in reducing emission of Indian industries.

“However, efforts need to be scaled up because the challenge is global and large,” he said.

Javadekar stressed that many countries have profited through historical emissions and these nations must now take more responsibility to address the climate challenges.

In this regard, he suggested technological and financial solutions. On technology, he said there will always be new innovations coming up which will reduce energy intensity and raise efficiency and these technologies need to be made available.

“All these measures have very important critical elements. And if government is supporting innovation, the society is supporting innovation, the innovation will not be bogged down in intellectual property rights, but will be available to the world because we are mitigating a disaster,” he said.

He further stressed there should not be a case of profiteering as motive in the case of technology transfer for tackling climate change.

“And so my submission is that if we really want to achieve (our targets), we have to address these two important issues because the world is suffering.”

On products which are produced through environmentally-friendly means but are more expensive than their environmentally-degrading substitutes, Javadekar said,”The world has seen that organic food and vegetables fetch more price. Why can’t industrial products do that? If we address all these issues...we will come out with certain different solutions.”

India and Sweden are co-leading an industry transition track under the high-level UN Climate Action Summit, hosted by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, that will create stronger commitments from sectors such as steel and cement to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

With a view to boosting ambition and accelerating action to implement the Paris Agreement, the Climate Action Summit will focus on nine interdependent tracks, which will be led by 19 countries in total and supported by international organisations.

The nine tracks are mitigation, social and political drivers, youth and public mobilisation, energy transition, industry transition, infrastructure, cities and local action, nature-based solutions, resilience and adaptation, climate finance and carbon pricing.

“The collaboration between India, Sweden, the World Economic Forum and many others to kick this process off is leadership by example and I look forward to seeing how this develops over the coming years,” Amina Mohammed, UN

Deputy Secretary General, said while addressing the ‘Setting the context for the industry transition programme’ for the Climate Action Summit here Saturday.

India and Sweden are co-leading the Industry Transition track, which will focus on creating stronger commitments from the “hard-to-abate sectors” such as steel, cement and build on positive momentum in areas such as shipping. It is supported by the World Economic Forum (WEF).

Other stakeholders in the industry track are The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), World Bank, Confederation of Indian Industry, Confederation of Swedish Enterprise and International Chamber of Commerce.

Among the expected outcome from the track is announcements from at least 6-7 CEOs from heavy industry and transport (i.e. chemicals, cement, steel, aluminium, trucking, shipping, aviation), across different geographies, making commitments to net-zero emissions by 2050 with a clear plan on how this will be achieved and a clear near-term deliverable.

188,Bioplastics: Leading the Way to a Better World,"Bioplastics: Leading the Way to a Better World

The World Economic Forum recently revealed the top 10 emerging technologies for 2019 that are expected to radically impact the global social and economic order. Top on the list is Bioplastics for a Circular Economy.

Less than 15% of the world’s plastic is recycled, with the rest incinerated, abandoned or sent to landfill. Biodegradable plastic offers a solution. The technology certainly benefits the circular economy.

In Thailand, a chemical company, PTT Global Chemical (GC) continues to drive sustainable growth in line with the concept of Circular Economy, both internally and externally. The company is also building social awareness that will lead to changing behaviour regarding the more efficient use of resources which will, in turn, enable GC to reach its goal of becoming a model of sustainability.

GC is also committed to conducting its operations with an emphasis on resource efficiency and environmental conservation, as a foundation for sustainable operations, more efficient manufacturing processes, lower consumption, improved waste management, and reduced environmental impact. This involves applying circular economy principles to technological and biochemical improvements to reduce waste and environmental impacts throughout GC's supply chain.

GC operates its business by applying circular economy principles both inside and outside the company, while at the same time increasing public awareness with a goal of changing behaviour to maximise the value of resources. A priority for GC is to become a role model of encouraging circular economy-led lifestyles known as the “Circular Living Concept”.

GC's sustainable management practices cover four areas: resource management from upstream to downstream; production management using the ""3Rs"" (Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle), which expands into ""5Rs"" (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Refuse, and Renewables); efficient consumption; and effective waste management. Another area of focus for GC is upcycling – applying innovations and creativity to add more value to products. This is also in line with the principles of the circular economy.

GC focuses on bioplastics used to produce packaging in various forms. GC is the major shareholder in NatureWorks, the world’s largest producer of PLA (Polylactic Acid), headquartered in the USA. GC has a 50% share in PTTMCC Biochem, the leader in BioPBS (Bio Polybutylene Succinate). PLA and bioPBS are bioplastics widely used for sustainable products globally. Bioplastics are plastics derived from natural raw materials. They have similar properties as conventional plastics but can be composted into carbon dioxide, water, and biomass that can be used for crops and other plants or for feedstock as part of circular economy. Bio-based bioplastics are produced by fermentation that converts natural raw materials like sugar into monomer which is polymerized into bioplastic resin. Bioplastics have been successfully developed on a commercial scale worldwide. They include Polylactic Acid (PLA) and Biopolybutylene Succinate (BioPBS.Bioplastics), compostable materials that take six months to one year to decompose under appropriate conditions.

GC works on bioplastics projects with various partners, including Benjarong BioPBS Coated Cup, Chulalongkorn University’s Zero Waste Cup, and Silpakorn University’s Be Smart Be Green Bioplastic straws. All aim to introduce environment-friendly products for sustainable lifestyles.

The latest initiative from the company is “GC Compostable Label”. GC has created labels certifying the products and packaging produced from compostable bioplastic pellets by GC group. This shows the intention to develop environment-friendly products, build confidence, and give assurance to consumers that the products they use are fully compostable and good for the environment, all in accordance with strict circular economy principles.",Thailand,2019.09

230,Saturday Indesign Ambassador Tan Szue Hann | Indesignlive.sg,"Our Ambassadors for Saturday Indesign 2019 are at the forefront of the industry. Find out what makes them tick in our profile series. First up is architect Tan Szue Hann – the Managing Director of MINIWIZ Singapore.

MINIWIZ is a circular economy RD&D [Research, Design & Development] company that turns waste materials into architecture, interiors, furniture, products, fashion and anything else that is worthwhile and meaningful.

The great thing about what MINIWIZ produces is that sustainability credentials are matched by visual appeal. The company’s Polli-Ber Brick is the perfect example. This modular interlocking brick made with recycled plastic and agricultural waste is so beautiful that it will serve as the trophy for the winning team in our Saturday Indesign 2019 Debate!

Since Hann joined the company and established its Singapore office earlier this year, he has been busy not only spreading awareness of the MINIWIZ catalogue of modular building materials, furniture and objects, but also working with government to push toward circular economy initiatives.

We sat down on some of MINIWIZ’s own furniture (incorporating recycled materials, of course) for a chat about Hann’s goals for a more sustainable Singapore, and the kinds of solutions MINIWIZ can offer designers and their clients.

What is the key message you’d like people to understand about MINIWIZ and what it does?

We can really use design to elevate the value of materials. A lot of what we do at MINIWIZ is applying design and engineering so that people appreciate the value of what’s been recycled. A lot of people look at recycled goods and think, “Hey, that used to be someone else’s.” And in our culture, in Asia, sometimes there’s a bit of stigma to that. But if we re-engineer, re-design and almost make it unrecognisable, then that allows for the material to gain a new perceived value.

But what we do is not just about perception or how something looks, but also how it performs. A new composite or a newly engineered material can often perform better than it originally could have.

Could you give us some examples?

For example, our Polli-Ber Brick – which will be the Saturday Indesign Debate trophy – is a composite of polystyrene, which is otherwise very brittle, and rice husks from agricultural waste. Combining those in a certain proportion makes the plastic a lot less brittle. The rice husks also bring a new aesthetic quality to the material. And that also empirically improves its value.

In what contexts are people specifying the Polli-Ber Brick? 



We’ve supplied it for the backdrop of a stage set, it’s been made into feature walls (including architectural offices), and of course it’s the entrance wall at our MINIWIZ Singapore office as well. So far it’s been used in a decorative way and as partition walls, but we have also engineered a material that can also be used for exterior walls. It’s similar to Polli-Ber Brick, but we fill the cavity with concrete so it becomes fireproof as well.

What sort of product inventory does MINIWIZ keep, and how can your products be ordered?

We work on a solutions-based model. What that means is we try to customise solutions for architects, for developers, for homeowners or whoever it is. We don’t carry a huge inventory of our products. The model is more like – what kind of space do you have? What sort of products or combinations thereof could actually make sense for what you require? So it could be partially bricks, it could be partially plastic felt wall panels – depending on what you need to do with the space and how it needs to perform. We can also start introducing furniture that’s made of recycled waste. So it’s a combination of all these things.

Therefore we don’t have an exact inventory from which you can pick and choose. We customise for you and we start making the production orders accordingly. So every product is customised, even though the building blocks are the same.

The production is currently primarily based in Taiwan [where the MINIWIZ headquarters are located], although we are in talks of bringing it closer to the SEA region to mitigate carbon footprint. We also have portable machines for producing our wall tiles and our smaller items, so we can manufacture those on site, anywhere in the world.

How and why are you working with government here in Singapore? What are you hoping to achieve?

Working with the government is crucial because we need a whole culture where the circular economy is the established norm. Right now we’re not there. We need to get the framework and policy in place such that recycling becomes a way of life, and we’re sorting out our own waste before it goes into the dump. When recyclable materials are already sorted out and fairly clean, then the re-engineering and production of materials can begin.

Without those kinds of policies, people are just going to continue throwing things away the same way they have in the past. When it comes to consumers, there’s a lot of wanton throwing away of things that are only used once or twice. That’s not good enough for the sustainable nation we want to be. We need to start developing a culture that appreciates the multiple uses of materials and the constant renewal of goods into different things. That’s how we can begin to establish a circular economy.

“We need to start developing a culture that appreciates the multiple uses of materials and the constant renewal of goods into different things.”

That doesn’t mean that we cut off the consumer chain entirely, or that we are anti-consumerist. We’re not obviously, because you need growth to happen. But if we start thinking about building new things with what we currently have, without expending more carbon to generate brand new materials, that’s the beginning of closing that loop.

Perhaps one of the factors leading to Singapore’s lack of recycling culture is the domestic rubbish chute. Do you agree?

I’ll pull the lens a bit further back. The main problem related to the lack of recycling is the whole culture of efficiency. We’re obsessed with being efficient and with hygiene. There are multiple instances where single-use plastics are extremely necessary – primarily in the medical field. But I think it’s also about what is sensible. There’s a fine balance to keep between what is convenient and what is considerate.

What did you enjoy at past editions of Saturday Indesign, and what are you looking forward to this year?

Saturday Indesign is a confluence of the exciting new design products that are out there, and the key players in the industry – all within one day, and within a curated set of spaces. To have Indesign curate an event and have the entire community come down and engage in discourse and conversations about design – and of course the debate! – that’s a red-letter calendar event that everyone can look forward to. And I imagine it will only keep growing.

The buzz is not just the event, but also its combination with what’s out there on the web. The ecosystem that creates has become even stronger than in previous years. I’m really proud to be an Ambassador for Saturday Indesign and I’m looking forward to 12 October!

Thanks to MINIWIZ for being the Saturday Indesign 2019 Trophy Partner!

290,FMCG companies chase stiff deadlines to cut plastic use,"While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a deadline of October 2, 2019, for eradication of single-use plastic, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are working aggressively towards meeting their timelines of using 100% biodegradable plastic for packaging ready-to-eat products.

A lot of initiatives have been put in place to reduce, collect and recycle multi-layered plastic (MLP). Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles used for beverage products are being re-purposed to make apparels, footwear, furniture, etc, by many companies.

Sharukh Khan, executive director - operations, Dabur India, said the company is aiming to become a plastic waste neutral company by March 2021. “This is being done by collecting, processing and recycling 20,000 metric tonnes (mt) of post-consumer plastic waste. With this, the company would be collecting 100% of the plastic waste it generates through its product packaging,” said Khan.

However, players say a clear definition of what is single-use plastic in the Indian context is very crucial. According to industry players, items like plastic carry bags, plates, glasses, cups, cutlery, straws and take-away food containers and thermocol plates fall in this category.

They said the problem can largely be solved by embedding the concept of 5R – refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle and recover.

“It starts with educating consumers to avoid plastic use, if possible. The crucial step in achieving recycling or recovery is an effective source segregation. The challenge is mainly in terms of lack of the required infrastructure. The regulators should focus on systems for effective collection, recycle and recovery. A suitable extended producer responsibility (EPR) framework involving all the relevant stakeholders will help. We have allocated Rs 3.25 crore for EPR this year along with a lot of management time and attention. We have set our packaging targets for 2024-25. For our India operations, we will reduce packaging consumption per unit of production by 20% from 2017-18. We will also ensure that 100% of the packaging material we use is recyclable, reusable, recoverable or compostable,” said Rakesh Sinha, head - global supply chain, manufacturing and IT, Godrej Consumer Products Ltd.

PepsiCo India has been been working across states to collect, segregate and sustainably manage equivalent of 100% plastic packaging by 2021. It has partnered with organisations to upcycle plastic into creating utility products such as chairs, benches, tables, t-shirts, laptop bags -- for instance, six PET bottles are being used to make a t-shirt. “One of our key targets is to make 100% recyclable, compostable or biodegradable packaging by 2025 and we have been striving to design all packaging with the goal to achieve optimum results with utmost efficient use of material possible,” a PepsiCo India spokesperson said.

Hindustan Unilever (HUL) will move to 100% reusable, recyclable or compostable plastic packaging by 2025. The company is working with the government and other partners such as United Nations Development Programme on pilot projects for plastic waste management.

“We have also committed that 25% of all the plastic we use will come from recycled sources by 2025. We are working towards achieving this goal. We continually look at new ways to reduce, re-use, recycle and recover packaging and waste as we move towards becoming a zero-waste business. Globally, we have reduced nearly one-third of our packaging waste since 2010. We are committed to accelerating a transition to a circular economy, moving from the linear take-make-dispose model to a regenerative approach, which keeps materials at their highest value for as long as possible,” said an HUL spokesperson.

ITC has been adopting a holistic approach based on packaging optimisation, use of polymers that allow higher levels of recycling and supporting municipal programmes on waste source segregation, collection, reuse and recycling.

“Over 150 mt of post-consumer MLP was collected in Pune in partnership with a pioneering waste-pickers cooperative SWaCH and recycled as vegetable trays, flower pots, pallets, etc. Since its launch in June 2019, this programme is in the process of being scaled up to achieve an annual recycling target of 2,500 mt, ITC said.

Nestlé India's plans to 100% recyclable/ reusable packaging by 2025. It has designed a project called '2 minute Safaai ke naam' in Dehradun and Mussoorie in November 2018, wherein consumers were incentivised by giving them a packet of Maggi noodle for every 10 empty packets.

“We are working on developing more environment-friendly packaging materials. For single-use plastics at our out of home outlets, we are exploring alternative options. There are certain challenges in serving hot beverages in 100% paper-based options and we are trying to address that,” said a Nestlé India spokesperson.

Coca-Cola's primary packaging is completely recyclable and does not consist of single-use plastic, it said. While continuing with sustainable packaging initiatives, it is redesigning and light-weighting packaging, increasing renewable and recycled material use supporting recycling programmes.",Singapore,2019.09
296,Fortum India signs a MoU with CCS Haryana Agricultural University to make fiber from paddy straw,"Hisar: Fortum India, a Finnish clean energy company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar, a State University with the objective to establish collaboration in research about paddy and paddy straw.

The MoU was signed in the presence of Prof. K.P. Singh, Vice Chancellor, CCS Haryana Agricultural University by Mr. Sanjay Aggarwal, Managing Director, Fortum India Pvt Ltd. And Dr. S.K. Sehrawat, Director of Research, CCS Haryana Agriculture University, Hisar.

Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural University has been constantly working towards the management of paddy straw and as a first step, Fortum’s partnership with HAU will include to deepen understanding of the theoretical and practical knowledge and expertise in the areas of studying the properties of rice straw and other agri-biomass, its availability, socio economic impact, probable supply chain and other possible area of support, in the State of Haryana.

Prof. K.P. Singh, Vice Chancellor, HAU, while expressing his thoughts over the MoU, said, “This will give more thrust to the university’s crop residue management program. The university is striving not only for the proper management of crop residues but also for the fair value of everything coming out of the farm.”

“At the university, we are establishing an Innovation Centre for Agri waste Management (ICAWM). ICAWM aims to identify, synergistically develop and propagate circular economy based innovative technologies for conversion of crop residue into eco- friendly, technically efficient and economically viable Bio-waste value added products. We hope together we can find holistic solutions which will help in uplifting the farmer’s lives.” he added.

It is noteworthy that there is a serious problem of managing paddy straw in the states of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Some farmers burn crop residues and destroy them, causing environmental pollution. To protect the environment and to provide simple and economical options for the farmers to manage paddy straw, Haryana Agricultural University is working seriously under the guidance of Prof. K.P. Singh.

Commenting on the same, Mr. Sanjay Aggarwal, Managing Director of Fortum India Private Limited said, “We are proud to collaborate with Haryana Agricultural University, one of the leading universities of the country to solve the problem of paddy straw in Haryana. Burning of crop residues on a large scale in the fields emits greenhouse gas which has huge side effects on the environment. In three states in the Delhi region, 50 million tonnes of agrobiomass is burned every year. We intend to convert this agricultural waste into valuable products, provide solutions to reduce pollution, which will help local communities to become self-sufficient and raise their standard of living.”

“We will work with the university to make textile fiber from paddy straw, as well as other valuable chemicals which are used in many industries, to make bioplastics and to establish bio refinery in the future.”, he further added.

309,SCG enlists Dow in recycling plan,"Siam Cement Group (SCG) has teamed up with US materials science company Dow to conduct a feasibility study of plastic waste recycling and renewable feedstock operations in the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC).

Roongrote Rangsiyopash, SCG's president and chief executive, said the study will be concluded by December, after which both parties will outline the facility size and investment budget.

""This collaboration expects to operate mechanical and feedstock recycling from plastic resins, plastic waste and petrochemical feedstocks,"" he said. ""It is a business opportunity for SCG and Dow to embrace the circular economy concept, bringing practical solutions for recycling and upcycling of plastic waste to Thailand.""

SCG is also calling on the government to offer investment privileges for the circular economy because many companies are investing heavily in the concept.

""The privileges will attract investors to enter this scheme with many projects such as waste separation facilities,"" Mr Roongrote said.

He said both firms plan to expand their recycling operations beyond EEC provinces, but any move will depend on the volume of plastic waste circulated in the recycling facilities of each province.

Jim Fitterling, Dow's chief executive, said the company can provide its recycling technologies to support future operations in Thailand.

The collaboration with SCG is an example of Dow's strategy of enabling a shift to the circular economy for plastics by focusing on resource efficiency and integrating recycled content and renewable feedstocks into production processes.

Moreover, post-consumer plastics can become higher-value products through their extended lifespan.

Mr Fitterling said the plastic waste circulating in the oceans amounts to about 8 million tonnes worldwide. Thailand alone is responsible for some 1 million tonnes a year entering the seas.

""Dow expects that plastic waste locally can be recycled for this operation at roughly 200,000-300,000 tonnes per year in the near future,"" Mr Fitterling said.

Dow and SCG will study the possibilities for waste separation in the country. The study is expected to determine which types of waste plastic are suitable for waste separation and the best solution for a recycling system.

""Plastic waste recycling and renewable feedstock operations can start on a commercial scale of roughly 20,000-30,000 tonnes per year,"" Mr Fitterling said. ""The plastics are too valuable to be lost as waste, so they should be a part of the circular economy concept.""",Thailand,2019.09

PATA’s CEO Mario Hardy said the Plug and Play Travel Asia Pacific platform is “the perfect partnership” to foster sustainability among its members, transforming their businesses for “a more profitable, inclusive and ecological future”.

This is in line with the advocacy role that PATA has played in the Asia-Pacific region to drive “more inclusive stakeholder collaboration and public private partnerships”, Hardy added.

Since inception, Plug and Play has evolved to become one of the most established global consortium innovation platforms covering 14 industry-themed verticals that reviews thousands of start-ups per year across its 29 offices.

Jupe Tan, managing partner of Plug and Play Asia Pacific, said: “In the past few years, we’ve been collaborating with over 300 corporations – mostly in the Fortune500 category – to connect them with cutting-edge start-ups and execute their corporate innovation strategy. As part of our vision to help the world progress through innovation and connection, Plug and Play looks to continue to expand its reach within the regional tourism sector with more corporations to join the Plug and Play Travel Asia Pacific platform.”

Currently working with several prominent airlines, airports, hotels, travel agents and other industry stakeholders, Plug and Play aims to also provide regional local large enterprises with transfer and corporate best practices from its existing global corporate travel consortium.",Singapore,2019.09

3 September 2019, Bangkok – Mr. Suttha Ruengchaipaiboon, a President of Magnolia Quality Development Corporation Limited (MQDC), joined ‘Transformation to the Circular Built Environment’, a discussion organized by SCG Cement-Building Materials. Leading organizations from around the world exchanged ideas to drive the development of a circular economy for a sustainable world at Bangkok Convention Centre, Central World, Centara Grand Hotel.

Mr. Ruengchaipaiboon shared his experiences in achieving a circular economy with MQDC projects. MQDC’s reduction in waste through recycling and its use of renewable environment-friendly materials helped it win a second runner-up prize for sustainability at the AEC Excellence Awards 2017.

“Working under our principle of ‘sustainnovation’ to find innovative solutions for sustainability, MQDC builds and operates to optimize reuse and recycling for a circular economy,” said Mr. Ruengchaipaiboon.

“While constructing 101 True Digital Park, for example, we upcycled steel items as furniture for the project. Plastic materials became bags that help shoppers reduce their waste footprint. We now

partner with the project’s many restaurants, collecting leftovers. We compost this food waste over 24 hours to make fertilizer we distribute to local communities.”

Working with Building Information Modeling (BIM) process, MQDC’s project was the first in Southeast Asia to receive a prestigious AEC award, competing among 145 contestants from 32 countries.

MQDC has pioneered full-cycle use of BIM, enhancing the detail and accuracy of 3D models. This precision helped achieve savings at its project of 30% in energy, 40% in water, and 15,000 tons of CO2 each year, while still enabling an improved quality of life.

MQDC further received a ‘Smart Cities-Clean Energy’ award from the Ministry of Energy for its project’s use of advanced, environment-friendly technology.",Thailand,2019.09
353,WBCSD and Circular IQ partner to scale up the circular economy uptake by business,"Geneva, Amsterdam, 02 September 2019 - The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and Circular IQ today announced their partnership agreement to co-develop an online tool in support of the Circular Transition Indicators (CTI)-framework developed by WBCSD over the past year. The framework, which has been pilot tested by 15 leading companies, aims to help businesses calculate, measure and monitor their progress in the circular economy with to scale up impact and improve strategic decision making.

Continued extraction of finite resources, climate and demographic changes will make it harder for businesses to provide the products and services necessary for a well-functioning global circular economy. And today the global economy is only 9 per cent circular, which means that the pressure to accelerate the transition to a circular economy is growing. Successful circular initiatives will reduce dependence on dwindling natural resources and will create value for companies and their stakeholders.

“We look forward to collaborating with Circular IQ, an emerging innovator in the field of circular economy data-collection and reporting”, said Brendan Edgerton, WBCSD’s Director for Circular Economy of WBCSD. “Our partnership will deliver a unique tool that will help many business measure and track progress on their circularity building more momentum and business action to move to the circular economy and deliver the solutions needed to build a sustainable world.”

“Our experience in collecting and digitising existing data and using this data to improve decision-making, helps businesses to act and measure results”, said Roy Vercoulen, CEO and co-founder of Circular IQ. “I am very excited with this partnership. I believe our experience will help WBCSD to create tools, to support and empower companies to initiate actions to assess their circularity and start improving it.”

Jeff Turner, Vice President Sustainability at DSM, the chair of the CTI development project in the WBCSD working group, said “For DSM as a purpose -driven company that focuses on circular solutions, it is important that we can measure our circularity through a commonly agreed framework by the business community. This tool will not only help companies individually in collecting data and performing the calculations, it also ensures consistent outcomes for any company that chooses to use it and therefore increases the robustness of the CTI framework.”

Moving forward, consistent measurement metrics to assess circularity will be key. Circular IQ, and WBCSD are strongly aligned on the belief that our society faces major and global challenges regarding waste, pollution, resource depletion and global warming. Action and smart tooling are needed to effectively tackle these problems. The CTI-framework will help companies identify opportunities to improve their circularity and effectively address these challenges.

The two organisations are aligned in purpose, knowledge and expertise and look forward to starting their collaboration to bring the online tool for the CTI framework to life to provide companies across geographies and sectors with a tool that allows them to calculate, measure and monitor their transition to a circular economy.

The online tool will officially be launched at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in January 2020.",Singapore,2019.09

433,The Finn spearheading a charge to make Thailand's rubbish go round in circles,"The Finn spearheading a charge to make Thailand's rubbish go round in circles

As Finland is the world's first country to launch a national roadmap for its transition to a circular economy by 2025, the northern European nation is encouraging Thailand to adopt the model where resources are continually reused for the sustainable future of our planet.

""It is a new economic model in which materials are not destroyed at the end, but are used to make new products over and over again. Even more than that, consumption is based on sharing rather than owning; for example, you can rent a car or use a public transport service instead of owning one,"" said Kari Herlevi, the project director of the circular economy focus area at Sitra, the Finnish Innovation Fund, which aims to make Finland a role model of sustainability.

Mr Herlevi drew attention to the problem of the current so-called linear economy in which goods are manufactured from raw materials, sold in large quantities, and eventually thrown away.

""We overconsume our [finite] natural resources. We are not living within the planetary boundary. We are using more materials than we should, even in Finland,"" he told the Bangkok Post at the Finnish Ambassador's residence during his visit to Thailand on Oct 14.

In the face of these challenges, Finland had unveiled the world's first plan to adopt a circular economy, he said.

""We want to challenge the current situation and create a society that maintains the value of materials. We need a better economic system from environmental and economic points of view. In 2016, Sitra created a national roadmap to achieve the circular economy by 2025,"" he said.

Mr Herlevi is at the helm of the roadmap, and it's his job to implement economic reform and supervise various projects to ensure that Finland will become a carbon-neutral country by 2035.

""I took part in the World Circular Economy Forum [in June this year] to scale up the transition. I am now working on the circular economy playbook for Finnish SMEs and a carbon action pilot to speed up carbon sequestration,"" he said.

In addition, Mr Herlevi has recently shared views and experiences with Thai experts in the circular economy.

""We had the first discussion, so it's not yet practical cooperation. However, there is a great need in Thailand for improved resource recovery, waste management, transport and plastic recycling systems. Megacities like Bangkok would need circular economy solutions where the value of materials is maintained and inefficiencies could be reduced to bring significant reductions in waste and emissions. This would mean a strong commitment and large investment to change the system,"" he said.

Having worked in pollution-choked Shanghai, Mr Herlevi encouraged Asian countries to adopt the circular economy model to tackle environmental problems.

""Many national leaders have told me that the mitigation of climate change is too expensive, but it is more expensive to continue on the current path. In fact, the circular economy can cut down on emissions from heavy industries by applying high-value recycling of materials like aluminium, steel, plastic and cement.

""The circular economy can also bring savings on a practical level. For example, consumers can refill to save package costs. Shops could sell goods at lower prices because they don't offer containers. Of course, this doesn't apply to every product and it is not the most effective measure, but it is a practical way to reduce single-use plastic. The circular economy is about doing things differently. We should challenge our industries to innovate,"" he said.

Mr Herlevi said public demand for a better system is required to push for a circular economy.

""If you don't have political pressure, it is harder to change the current economic model. It is important for the education sector to get involved. In Finland, we have integrated the circular economy in all levels of education. Of course, it is a slow road, but it is necessary to include the circular economy in the national education system,"" he said.

Moreover, strong leadership and strong regulations are needed for such reform, he added.

""If there is no regulation, it is very hard to install a better system. You need top-down and bottom-up approaches. As consumption is concentrated in the city, you need a leader who really understands the situation. Individuals can do their part, but if the system is not working, it is almost impossible to do the right thing,"" he said.

When asked about climate youth movements, Mr Herlevi voiced his support, saying the young will bear the brunt of the future even if they make the least impact on the environment.

""It is understandable that they are vocal about their needs. Moreover, they are under-represented in politics. I think it is important that Greta Thunberg and others are active and speak their minds. Of course, we need to move from discussion to action. Policymakers should act according to the Paris Agreement,"" he said.

Most importantly, Mr Herlevi said everybody can contribute to the circular economy in their own way.

""Everybody can do something in their everyday life. You can think about what works for you and start from there. Have a positive mindset. Think about how you eat, live and travel. Is there anything you can change?"" he said.

Finland is known for its waste-sorting. Some Finns have up to seven bins at home. Like them, Mr Herlevi has made an effort to lead a circular life.

""I live in a house partly made of wood. I have installed solar panels and an underground heating and cooling system. I also recycle plastic, compost food waste and use the train to commute to work. [However] when you have a family, you tend to generate more waste as a household and reducing consumption is more challenging,"" he added.",Thailand,2019.10
467,Covestro commits to circular economy,"German high-tech polymer manufacturer Covestro plans to focus on the circular economy and be a creative force for the entire plastics industry.

The company aims to use raw materials from sustainable sources such as waste, plants and CO2 as much as possible in production. The goal is a departure from fossil resources such as crude oil.

Speaking at the world's largest plastics trade fair, K 2019 in Duesseldorf, Covestro chief executive Markus Steilemann insisted that used plastics must be recycled systematically and to the greatest possible extent.

""The great challenges of our time, such as climate change and the rising consumption of resources by the growing world population, make truly sustainable ways of living and economies an indispensable necessity. The linear patterns in consumption and production based on one-time use have become obsolete -- we must rather strengthen the idea of recycling and consistently align our actions accordingly,"" he said.

Mr Steilemann said the plastics industry in particular can and must drive the change to achieve a circular economy.

""Our company wants to be a pioneer in this process, for the benefit of the environment and society,"" he said.

Covestro recently started using alternative raw materials instead of crude oil in production, among other changes to adhere to the circular economy model.

The company also designs plastics from the outset so they can be effectively recycled. Plastic products must last as long as possible and waste should be avoided, said Mr Steilemann.

""Society, but also industry, must produce less waste. Above all, waste has to be disposed of systematically and must no longer end up uncontrolled in the environment,"" he said. ""Plastic waste in our oceans is essentially the result of inadequate waste management. Plastic in itself is not the problem and should not be prohibited. On the contrary, high-quality plastics are a problem solver and are urgently needed -- for renewable energies, new forms of mobility and sustainable construction, for instance.""

To stop the flow of plastic waste into bodies of water, Covestro is participating in the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, a worldwide company network that has been active since early 2019. In the new Circular Plastics Alliance, the company is also working with numerous other businesses and organisations to promote the recycling of plastics in Europe.

480,Here's what will take for the circular economy to go from an idea to reality,"Here’s an idea. What if you never had to buy a light bulb again? Instead, you lease light, like you lease a car or an apartment. It's just one idea that’s part of the circular economy.

Before we can understand the circular economy, well, it helps to define the linear economy. Most organisations today operate in the linear economy which is based on a 'take, make, and dispose' model. So, for example, a light bulb company takes resources, like glass or metal, to manufacture its products.The company makes the bulb and sells it to a customer like me who uses it.Once the light bulb burns out, I dispose of it. It’s likely neither the company nor I will ever see that light bulb again. For a light bulb company to make money in the linear economy, it tries to buy materials for the lowest cost possible and to sell as many bulbs as possible.

This model operates as if there are infinite resources, like glass or metal, in the world. But you and I know that’s not the case.

That’s why the circular economy treats materials like they're finite. A company in the circular economy doesn’t just recycle products but maintains ownership of them all along, so the model looks more like this, make, use and return.Let’s go back to the light bulb example.Instead of buying bulbs, this office in London leases its light from Philips Lighting. It signed a 15-year lease for the service and pays a fee each quarter.

Philips still owns the actual light bulbs and provides maintenance and replacements when needed, no extra cost.

This model gives Philips the incentive to produce energy-efficient light bulbs and it saves the office money with fixed lighting costs.It’s a radically different business model that takes companies more like service providers than sellers of a physical product. And it turns out lots of companies are looking for ways to get involved.Take H&M, one of the world’s largest clothing retailers. It’s working on a strategy to become 100 percent circular. The company collects old garments in its stores and recycles them. Since 2013, H&M says it has gathered more than 55,000 tons of fabric to reuse for new garments.Some governments are getting on board with the circular economy, too.The European Union adopted an action plan in 2015 aiming to make supply chains, you guessed it, more circular.

This includes everything from production to consumption, repair and manufacturing, and waste management. The point isn’t just to become more 'green' and create environmental benefits, there could be economic benefits too.One report estimated a shift toward the circular economy in the E.U. could increase GDP by an additional 12 percentage points by 2050. But moving from the linear economy to the circular economy also brings costs.

Companies would need to redesign their supply chains and products in order for them to be used again and again.Manufacturers might be burdened when it comes to the actual logistics of disposing and recycling. A recent report found only 22 percent of U.K. companies are trying to generate value from products that are returned for reuse, recycling or refurbishing. It’s estimated the cost of transitioning to a fully efficient reuse and recycling system across Europe could be as much as 108 billion euros, roughly 130 billion dollars.

Cost is one thing. Changing people’s mindsets is another. And that’s what it'll take for the circular economy to go from an idea to reality for everyone.",India,2019.10
519,Plastic industry in recycling push,"Thais can profit from plastic waste, as well as help the environment, by adopting a more circular economy, according to one of the world's largest plastic producers, Indorama Ventures Plc.

The company's senior vice-president Richard Jones told the Bangkok Post last week that plastic waste deserves proper management to prevent it from ending up in the ocean, causing damage to the marine ecosystem.

Part of that management involves collecting plastic waste, which can be sold for recycling, said Mr Jones, who emphasised that 82% of plastic bottles are already collected and re-used in one form or another.

He said the polyethene terephthalate (PET) used to make plastic water bottles accounts for around 10% of the plastic produced in the world and is an excellent candidate for multi-purpose recycling.

Many countries including Japan, Australia and EU countries allow food containers and drinking water to be made using a proportion of recycled plastics.

Thailand, on the other hand, still required all such bottles and boxes to made from 100% virgin plastics.

Mr Jones said that Indorama is working to persuade the government to change the country's regulations on this issue.

""We and our partners are working together to make it happen. We understand the Thai Food and Drug Administration's concerns, but we are willing to help the FDA have more confidence on the issue,"" he said.

He said many companies are looking to add recycled PET to their products, such as Nestle company that has eyed having 100% recycled PET, which is regarded as a good opportunity for any Thai firms wanting to produce plastic with recycled PET.

According to the company's sustainable report last year, between 2011-2018 it recycled 38 billion PET bottles, or 840,000 tonnes.

It plans to recycle a further 750,000 tonnes by the year 2025.

The company has also worked with 15 schools and 10 organisations to create a concept of sustainable development in communities, which finally could manage over 2 tonnes of PET bottles and produce 2,500 plastic-made shirts from that waste for charity.

Mr Jones said he hopes the government's recycling policy will lead to clean businesses as well as a focus by the public on effective waste separation.

According to the Pollution Control Department's annual report in 2018, the country produced 27.8 million tonnes of waste, of which 39% (10.88 million tonnes) was disposed of in landfill sites. Plastic waste accounted for around two million tonnes, of which 500,000 tonnes (plastic bottles) was recycled. However, there were still around 1.2 million tonnes of unrecycled plastic bags.",Thailand,2019.10
558,Circular economy a viable solution for developing economies,"To meet the needs of future generations, fundamental change in the way we use natural resources is necessary. Current global resource extraction patterns are inconsistent with internationally agreed goals to limit global average temperature increases to below 1.5 ° C above pre-industrial levels. Redirecting to a sustainable growth direction would require significant changes in both the productive use of primary resources and a significant degree of primary resource replacement with secondary materials – those obtained from waste streams and reused or reconditioned for further use.

The definition of ‘ circular economy ‘ is increasingly becoming a new robust growth model. A circular economy is one where goods and services are recycled, repaired and reused instead of disposed, and waste from one industrial process becomes a prized input into another. The design and optimization of resource ‘ loops ‘ across value chains can help meet the material needs of growing populations by drastically lower levels of primary resource use per capita. The concept of circular economy is now a fundamental component of both the 2050 Long-Term Strategy for the EU to reach a climate-neutral Europe and the five-year plans for China. Japan placed the circular economy as a priority for the G20 Summit in 2019.

In contrast in our country Pakistan, given significant development and political progress, inadequate attention has been paid to circular economy pathways and the same situation prevails in other developing countries. Structural and political conditions, as well as the faster pace of growth and industrial development, would demand different strategies to those implemented in developed countries; for example, the agricultural sector has so far received minimal attention in global circular economy discussions, but will need to play a central role in the circular economy pathways of developing countries. Innovation is already occurring in developing countries, in the agricultural sector and well beyond, and policymakers in developing countries are starting to implement aggressive policies for more resource-efficient and circular industrial growth patterns. The circular economy presents the conventional manufacturing-led growth model with a compelling alternative strategy for industrial development and job creation. The circular economy remains mainly recognized as a tool for waste management and recycling, but the economic opportunities are much wider and more complex. The adoption of this model could provide new business opportunities for economic differentiation, value creation and skill development with the right supporting conditions. Developing countries like Pakistan should take advantage of the new economic opportunities in a strong position. A wide informal industries are already involved in’ circular’ practices-for example in areas such as electronic waste (e-waste) and telephone repairs -and could engage in supply chains with higher-value circular economy. Therefore, with appropriate investment, developing countries can’ leapfrog’ developed countries to incorporate sustainable production and consumption at the core of their economies in digital and material innovation.

A transition to a circular economy carries with it some trade-offs that need constant monitoring. In the absence of a systematic and strategic approach to the circular economy at national or international level, there is a danger that under the circular economy umbrella companies will pursue perfunctory-or, at worst, negative-practices that discourage more efficient and higher-value use of content. For example, waste-to-energy projects using under-standard waste disposal methods may carry environmental and human health risks and may also rely on more suitable waste sources for previous-life goods. Exchange-offs may also occur where circular proposals suggest major industrial policy shifts: in mineral-intensive economies, for instance, circular strategies may promote value-added, but may also threaten job losses among those working in resource extraction and basic processing.

Circular economy’s progress in developing countries will be important in ensuring sustainable growth for global efforts. Developing countries will already be global production centers and are expected to become major market drivers. Progress now in incorporating circular concepts in industrial growth and strategies for infrastructural development will help meet the needs of rising and rapidly expanding populations while balancing against a continuing increase in primary resource usage, related emissions, and pollution. For instance, the CE can help deliver quality housing and infrastructure at low economic and environmental costs by following flexible, responsive and resilient design principles. Circularity in international value chains and the governance and investment structures needed to enable a global circular economy need to be given greater attention. In 2015, East African countries imposed a ban on secondary textile imports to protect their domestic industries, worried about China’s entry into the market of large volumes of cheap second-hand clothes. The ban was replaced by an import tax after the US threatened retaliation, but the episode demonstrated how, if not carefully managed, trade in secondary materials could lead to conflicts with conventional sectors and between countries. And the implementation of a complete ban on solid waste by China in 2018 brought to light the importance of creating integrated, open supply chains in waste and secondary materials if hazardous waste disposal activities are to be avoided and circular economy value chains are to emerge on a scale. In order to agree on common rules and standards for international circular value, greater cooperation is needed at global level.

There is an immediate need to extend the global circular economy conversation to include developing countries and to invest political and financial capital in promoting an inclusive, global circular economy growth. Governments in developed countries have an important role to play in fostering meaningful dialog on how best to manage the global complexities of circular economy policies. Support from international agencies such as the UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) will be critical to facilitating the piloting of circular economy solutions among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries and along international value chains to demonstrate the viability of cross-border circular value chains at scale. And proactive engagement by multinational companies with suppliers in developing countries – including SMEs and those operating in the informal sector – will be necessary for circular activities to be scaled up in a manner that is inclusive and avoids the displacement of vulnerable workers.

Therefore, in order to conclude I believe action is required on three fronts firstly by aligning the circular economy with current technology policy priorities. To incorporate the circular economy into high-level business policies and policy planning, decision-makers need trust that circular economy solutions are aligned with sustainable development priorities, including promoting stable economic growth and providing the most vulnerable people with opportunities. National governments in developing countries must recognize synergies between the circular economy and existing national plans and conduct an analysis of the scope of opportunities for transition to a circular economy through key economic sectors. Governments of donors must embrace the circular economy as an industrial development tool in developing countries and raise funds to support the innovation and expansion of circular economy. Secondly, there is need for continuity to invest in the basics in developed countries to support the transition to the circular economy. There will be a need for effective governance mechanisms, inclusive policies and collaborations at national, regional and international level to create an enabling environment for testing and rolling out circular economy activities. Thirdly, there should be support for an inclusive international circular economy strategy that encourages cooperation and partnership. Trade and cooperation are key ingredients in speeding up the circular economy in developing economies, and leveraging foreign investment will rely on harnessing opportunities for innovation.

571,"Plastic reuse the most efficient way to solve marine waste issue, experts say","Although marine plastic has become a prominent environmental issue in recent years, plastic is too valuable a resource to ever truly go away, so effectively managing such waste and placing it in a circular economy system would be the most efficient way to solve the issue, experts at a Tokyo seminar said last week.

Some panelists proposed solutions such as utilizing cutting-edge biodegradable polymer and the implementation of new international standards for plastic biodegradability.

Foreign dignitaries, government ministry officials, businesses and members of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization came together at the Japan-UNIDO Multi-stakeholder Cooperation Dialogue to discuss solutions to the marine plastic issue.

“At UNIDO we believe that the issue of marine plastics is caused primarily by a lack of proper treatment of waste. Promoting good circular economy … would help to reduce plastic leakage to the environment as a whole and the marine environment specifically,” said UNIDO Deputy Director General Hiroshi Kuniyoshi at his opening keynote address.

Eight million tons of plastic litter reach the ocean every year, leaving a devastating effect on marine life, conservation efforts and the environment.

Yet only 9 percent of plastic waste ever produced have been recycled, while another 12 percent have been incinerated, according to a working paper released by UNIDO in April. The rest, which almost amounts to 80 percent, ended up in either the natural environment or in a landfill.

“Plastic is a very valuable material, and there are so many advantages in using it. … I think it’s best to think about how we can really make use of the characteristics of plastic, while also finding ways to manage it and ensure that it doesn’t damage the environment,” explained Kuniyoshi in an interview with The Japan Times.

A circular economy aims to create a closed-loop system where resources are reused over its life cycle, ultimately reducing resource input as well as waste output over the economic cycle. This is in contrast to a linear economy, where resources are taken, used once and then thrown away.

“In principle everyone can win, and with circular economy, we are as close as possible to a formula where you can get companies to do the right thing for the environment and earn money and therefore do it voluntarily,” Stephans Sicars, director of the Department of Environment at UNIDO, told The Japan Times after the event.

Sicars added that with a circular economy, the power of economics would guide people’s interests toward sustainable choices even in areas where enforcement isn’t as strong. As an example, he mentioned that plastic bags may be banned in an area but the ban itself fails to make a difference because of the lack of enforcement.

“Consequently, when it becomes the self-interest of people, to work on reducing waste and reducing materials used, and repairing more … one reduces environmental impact even where regulation is maybe not so strong. And this is where we come from.”

Some participants at the seminar were already making headway in inching closer to a circular economy.

Kaneka Co. showed off its polymer research, which could replace conventional PET bottles with a product that is environmentally friendly and would be biodegradable both on land and in the ocean.

Masao Kunioka, a councilor at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, also talked of creating new international industry standards and requirements for the biodegradability of plastics.

“In our opinion, if you don’t change how products are being designed and used, then the plastic litter problem will not be resolved,” but that also leaves space for new, green businesses to come into existence too, explained Sicars in his address at the seminar.

“To unleash the power of economics … and assign new responsibility to those using and designing plastic products is key to force the industry to change,” he added.",Japan,2019.10
575,Covestro Plans to Promote Circular Economy - CTIMES News,"The aim is to achieve the greatest possible departure from fossil resources such as crude oil. Above all, used plastics must be recycled systematically and to the greatest possible extent. Covestro intends to develop new technologies exactly for this purpose. Overall, the company wants to shape the transition from a disposable economy to a circular economy with as many partners as possible and expects this to open up entirely new business opportunities.

“The great challenges of our time, such as climate change and the increasing consumption of resources by the growing world population, make truly sustainable ways of living and economies an indispensable necessity. The linear patterns in consumption and production based on one-time use have become obsolete – we must rather strengthen the idea of recycling and consistently align our actions accordingly, ” stresses Covestro CEO Dr. Markus Steilemann.

According to Steilemann, the plastics industry in particular can and must drive the change to achieve a circular economy. “Our company wants to be a pioneer in this process – for the benefit of the environment and society, but of course also for the benefit of our customers, who want to join us on our path to the circular economy.”

In order to promote the circular economy, Covestro has taken a first step in establishing a global strategic program to establish circularity throughout all areas of the company. It will then be backed by concrete and measurable objectives. The materials manufacturer has already taken several steps in this direction. For instance, it has recently been using alternative raw materials instead of crude oil to move the important element carbon virtually in a circle. Especially when it comes to using CO2 as a new raw material, Covestro sees itself as a pioneer and, with its innovative technology, is now in the grand finale of the prestigious German President’s Award.

However, the greatest potential for closing cycles is likely to lie in the recycling of plastic waste. In order to be able to make greater use of it than before, waste disposal systems must be considerably improved and redesigned. Covestro wants to contribute to this above all by developing new recycling technologies. The aim must be to use the most energy-efficient methods possible to convert used plastics back into their molecules. In a joint project, for example, the company is conducting concrete research into the reuse of soft polyurethane foam, which is used to make mattresses.

On top of this, Covestro intends to increasingly design plastics from the outset so that they can be effectively recycled. At the same time, plastic products must last as long as possible and be used to avoid waste.

""Society, but also industry, must produce less waste. Above all, waste has to be disposed of systematically and must no longer end up uncontrolled in the environment,"" says CEO Steilemann. ""Plastic waste in our oceans is essentially the result of inadequate waste management. Plastic in itself is not the problem and should not be prohibited. On the contrary, high-quality plastics are a problem solver and are urgently needed – for renewable energies, new forms of mobility and sustainable construction, for instance"".

In order to stop the flow of plastic waste into the bodies of water, Covestro is also involved in the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, a worldwide company network that has been active since early 2019. In the new Circular Plastics Alliance, the company is also working with numerous other businesses and organizations to promote the recycling of plastics in Europe.

Overall, Covestro wants to cooperate with as many players as possible in all areas of the value chain in order to find the best solutions for the circular economy. The company assumes that a recycling-oriented economy will also lead to new business opportunities. New value creation paths and new business relationships beyond the existing B2B business are potential opportunities.

At the world's largest plastics trade fair, K 2019 in Düsseldorf, Covestro will be presenting many prime examples of products and technologies that can help close material cycles in various sectors. Together with its partners, Covestro has for example developed a concept for manufacturing new electronic components from used polycarbonate. Covestro will also be hosting a special theme day at its booth on October 23 dedicated to the topic of the circular economy.",Taiwan,2019.10
613,The importance of circular economy,"Marcin Lapaj, the global business development manager of Henkel AG was in India. During a talk on circular economy, he said, ""It is broader than just recycling. It covers design and the use of recycled materials."" He stated that circular economy is broader than just recycling; and it covers design and the use of recycled materials.

He added, only waste that is collected, can be recycled.

Marcin Lapaj was clear that every material for which we do not have a recycling process becomes waste eventually.

Through additional investments in waste collection worldwide, plastics pollution can already be avoided. Lapaj spoke of different types of collection pathways. These are: communal pickups to recycling yard to dedicated bins to in-store returns.

Different types of plastics cannot be recycled together, they need to be sorted apart. By introducing recycling, we can turn waste back into valuable material. Some countries send all waste to landfills where valuables are “picked” manually under precarious conditions. Sorting rates can be as high as in very developed countries.

Mechanical recycling of plastics occurs by melting, filtering and degassing in an extruder. All inks, coatings and adhesives are blended into the plastic recyclate, reducing its purity. Whereas chemical recycling can convert plastics back into raw materials identical to fossil ones.

His message was we need innovation. In addition to work on the choice of materials, the existing system, the existing production-consumption structures, but also working on transforming the packaging system – to make it more sustainable.

In order to quickly and reliably determine the recyclability of new packaging, Henkel offers a software tool EasyD4R. Henkel. It is available on its website under www.henkel.com/easyd4r so that more companies and organisations can use it and more easily develop sustainable packaging solutions.

WhatPackaging? View: A problem in India is: everyone thinks in terms of their factory gate, their store entrance, or home dustbin. The scope of responsibility extends far beyond those limits. Whenever a customer makes a purchase and thus becomes the owner of the plastic bag, he or she also becomes part of an integrated system. So solutions have to be devised from a holistic standpoint. All the players – from the politicians who write the policy, the manufacturers, the wholesalers and the retailers right through to the consumers – bear a common responsibility.",India,2019.10
620,"Ahead of World Food Day, Italy PM backs project promoting sustainable farming in Africa - Xinhua | English.news.cn","ROME, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Saturday presided over the signing of a cooperation agreement to promote sustainable farming in Africa.

The agreement between Italian farmers' association Coldiretti, Italy's oil and gas giant Eni, and Bonifiche Ferraresi SpA, an Italian company that specializes in innovative farming technology, was inked at the close of the two-day International Forum on Agriculture and Food held in northern Italian town of Cernobbio.

The objective of the Africa Project ""is to export a development model that bets on...the potential of family farms, thereby supporting small producers in the South of the world..."" Coldiretti President Ettore Prandini said in a statement.

The so-called Africa Project will roll out an initial pilot project in Ghana, according to Coldiretti.

Food and agriculture are the nexus of ""food and nutritional security, accessibility, stability... safeguarding the environment and biodiversity, sustainable development and social equity,"" the Italian prime minister said in remarks posted on the government's website.

The Africa Project must promote ""a marriage between economy and ecology, which must go hand in hand,"" Conte said. ""And they must do so in Africa, where a great portion of the global population is concentrated...""

Conte also announced that he will take part in the World Food Day events at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) next Wednesday in Rome.

""It will be an opportunity to reiterate a more and more intense international cooperation so that the food and agriculture of the future proceed in step along the path of sustainability,"" Conte said.

This means ""obtaining more with less and producing safe and nutritious food for all while preserving natural resources, which cannot last forever,"" he said.

""We have set up...a model of cooperation that, through know-how and technology, responds to two essential needs of our times: the need to contribute in a sustainable way to the social and economic development of developing countries and at the same time, the promotion of a model of energy production that is more and more sustainable and oriented towards decarbonization,"" Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi said in a statement.

""These are vital themes for the planet,"" Descalzi said, adding that with the Africa Project, Eni reaches a double objective: that of promoting local development in the countries in which it operates, and that of favoring ""a more and more efficient and circular economic system.""

Sustainability and climate change are becoming hot-button issues: three out of four Italians believe the environmental situation in the world is serious or extremely serious, according to a study of Ixe pollsters published by Coldiretti on Friday.

Climate change topped the list of emergencies mentioned by respondents, followed by the proliferation of plastic waste, air, sea and river pollution, and extreme weather events caused by climate change, according to the survey.

In the first nine months of 2019, Italy has experienced 1,336 extreme weather events, up 75 percent compared to last year, Coldiretti said.",China,2019.10
695,Friends of the Earth shows Korea how to reduce plastic waste,"The European branch of the world's largest grassroots environmental network has shown Seoul how the organization is working to reduce plastic waste in Europe, which has the second-highest amount of any continent.

 Meadhbh Bolger from Friends of the Earth Europe, an arm of Friends of the Earth International, met members of the Korea Federation for Environmental Movements ― the Korean branch ― in Seoul in September. 

 The European Union government has been battling plastic, which have been significantly damaging the region with waste process emissions and solid waste. In 2019, the region had 0.86 gigatonnes of equivalent carbon dioxide, equal to the emissions from 189 500-megawatt coal-fired power plants at full capacity. The power plant figure, given the status quo remains, is expected to jump to 295 in 2030, and 615 in 2050. 

 ""In addition to the emissions, we have had to choose an unjust way of exporting the waste to other countries, including China, where we had sent 40 percent of the waste that was environmentally most hazardous,"" Bolger said.

 ""With recycling having a limited effect, we needed to reduce the use of plastics and change our economic structures and manufacturing processes that abuse the use of plastics.""



The European Union introduced a Plastic Bags Directive in 2015, which aimed to have each person use 40 plastic bags or less each year until 2025 and, one year into effect, had reduced the use of such bags by 80 percent.

 In the same year a Circular Economy Package introduced 54 revisions to existing regulations. Additional restrictions were announced in Strategy on Plastics 2018 that required plastic wrappers to be recyclable by 2030 and Single-use Plastics Directive 2019 that cut plastic waste in oceans by 85 percent.

 The EU directives encouraged member states to come up with their own rules. The Flanders region in northern Belgium banned single-use food wrappers at any public event until 2020.

 Bolger said European citizens and private entities mostly welcomed the anti-plastic regulations because people were well-informed of the mandates' importance through news reports and other media.

 ""In our recent survey in 28 EU member states, 70 percent of responding supermarkets embraced EU policies to reduce wrappers and other wastes,"" Bolger said. She said only some corporations opposed the policies.



With its growing use of plastics, Korea has been trading the waste with other countries to discard or recycle it. The trade in 2018 started posting a loss when the country imported 151,292 tons compared to 67,441 tons of exports ― generating a deficit of almost $47 million.

 The change began after the 14th Conference of Parties to the Basel Convention last May when Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam and Malaysia stopped accepting Korean plastic waste. That cranked up Korea's plastic imports, mostly from Japan, the United States and other OECD member states. 

 Korea imports plastics because domestic plastic waste that is mostly made with multiple properties is not recyclable by itself. Calls began for Korean manufacturers to use single property, like cooking oil bottles made in the U.S. that singularly used high-density polyethylene. The same Korean products use polypropylene for caps and polyethylene for the rest.

 The Korean environment ministry last July said the country's unrecycled plastic waste and other waste totaled 1.2 million tons ― due to lack of facilities to burn, bury or recycle it. 

 ""Korea is a gigantic waste producer, producing 4,000 tons of plastic waste each day,"" said Korean private lab Resource Recycling Consulting chief Hong Soo-yeol. ""But they still have this systematic structure that for the waste to be recycled we must import used plastic from advanced countries.""",Republic of Korea,2019.10
743,‘Total plan to handle plastic waste much needed’,"PETALING JAYA: The slew of negative publicity of late on the recycling industry has put the authorised plastics recycling industry in a bad light, says the Malaysian Plastics Manufacturers Association (MPMA) and its counterpart, the Malaysia Plastics Recyclers Association (MPRA).“It has portrayed Malaysia as a dumping ground for waste from developed countries, but what we are seeing are symptoms of waste smuggled in by illegal recyclers,” said MPMA vice-president C.C. Cheah.Speaking at the launch of a white paper on the Malaysian plastics recycling industry here yesterday, Cheah said without a comprehensive framework to govern the entire industry, no amount of public clean-ups would stop pollution if resources, recyclable or otherwise, continued to be mismanaged.The white paper, he said, came about following the recent negative publicity which affected the image of the country and the industry.“Hence, we have taken a step forward in the recovery of value from plastic waste by publishing a white paper on the recycling industry,” he said as he presented a copy of the report to Housing and Local Government Minister Zuraida Kamaruddin here.Titled “An Advanced Plastics Recycing Industry for Malaysia”, the paper is jointly published by MPMA and MPRA, and in collaboration with Monash University Malaysia.Taking nearly two months to be written, the paper stated that Malaysia must move into an era characterised by a modern plastic recycling industry to maximise resource recovery and reduce pollution so that the country could enter a genuine state of circular economy.A circular economy is an economic system that aims to eliminate waste and continuously use resources for as long as possible.Moving forward, Cheah said Malaysia must have a comprehensive look at the life cycle of plastics, from the design stage all the way to (resource) reduction, recycling and proper disposal at the end of life.“An advanced plastic recycling industry will support an overall effective waste management system, and the industry alone cannot do it,” said Cheah, adding that there should be multiple collaborations between stakeholders such as MPRA, the government, local councils, waste contractors and so on.He added that the plastic recycling industry had already contributed RM4.5bil to the Malaysian economy, and there was further opportunity for growth when more waste plastic was recovered as a resource that helped catalyse the development of a circular economy.Transitioning to a circular economy would help Malaysia gain in resource efficiency, as well as create jobs and grow the economy, said Prof Pervaiz K. Ahmed, deputy head of research from Monash University Malaysia’s School of Business.“Smart policies send strong signals to create longer term predictability for investment and encouraging the development of new markets which are important drivers of the circular economy,” he said.The white paper can be downloaded from mpma.org.my/v4/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/White-Paper-FINALR.pdf",Malaysia,2019.10
769,Online trade hurts locals,"The massive growth of transnational e-commerce is putting local micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in a tight corner and is likely to have an impact on employment in the retail and related sectors, a seminar was told on Saturday.

Thanavath Phonvichai, vice-president for research at the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, told the 37th TCC annual meeting in Lampang attended by more than 2,000 members that the business community has voiced concerns about overseas online shopping by Thai consumers.

Estimated at up to 100 billion baht in value, most online purchases are made from China, he said, noting that even though cross-border online shopping allows Thai consumers access to cheap goods and services, its negative impacts are being felt by local merchants and MSMEs who operate traditional stores.

""Merchants are complaining about how slow their businesses have been. Overseas online shopping has a role in this,"" he said.

Moreover, it is feared this disruption may have wider repercussions on retail employment as the government is unable to collect value-added tax (VAT) from transnational e-commerce transactions, he said.

According to Mr Thanavath, the business community is concerned this may also contribute to the country's economic slowdown.

Merchants should be encouraged to place their products on international e-marketplaces, and the government should invite giant e-commerce companies to set up distribution centres in Thailand, which will allow it to collect VAT and offset the impact, he said.

Meanwhile, the TCC also pledged to spearhead a campaign to see the Clean Air Act become law at the annual meeting.

TCC chairman Kalin Sarasin said the proposed law seeks to establish a new agency to handle air pollution and coordinate with authorities in neighbouring countries in tackling open burning.

In the opening session of the 37th annual meeting titled ""Thaitay in Action"", Mr Kalin said the forum will explore how to prepare from challenges from tech disruption.

He said that although the domestic economy is bearing the brunt of the persistent trade war between China and the United States, the stronger baht and the sharing economy, there is still an opportunity to apply ""Thaitay in Action"" to shore up the economy.

The sharing economy is based on acquiring, providing or sharing access to goods and services often facilitated by a community-based online platform.

Launched in 2015, the Thaitay concept involves solutions to stimulate local economies by mixing innovation and technology with storytelling. An increase in income in local communities will help reduce income disparity.

He said the TCC will take the lead in applying the concept, together with the bioeconomy, circular economy and green economy (BCG) models, to drive the economy.

The BCG model, developed by the Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation, has a goal of raising Thailand's GDP by one trillion baht over the next five years.

The Minister of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation, Suvit Maesincee, said yesterday the BCG master plan has been proposed to the prime minister and the government is expected to hold a meeting with the private sector and farmers' council in two weeks.",Thailand,2019.11

832,German chemical giant BASF starts large investment project in China - China.org.cn,"German chemical giant BASF on Saturday officially launched its largest-ever investment project, with financing estimated to reach up to US$10 billion upon completion, in south China's Guangdong Province.

The BASF smart Verbund project, located in the city of Zhanjiang, will initially include plants to produce engineering plastics and TPU serving a range of key industries. They are expected to go into production by 2022.

The Verbund project is the first wholly foreign-funded project in China's heavy chemical industry.

""By utilizing the latest digital technologies and applying the highest safety standards, the new Verbund site will be a role model for sustainable production contributing to the development of a circular economy in China,"" said Dr. Martin Brudermuller, chairman of the board of executive directors of BASF SE.

The whole Verbund site in Zhanjiang is planned to be completed by 2030, when it will cover 9 square km.

""Zhanjiang is a perfect location for BASF to further strengthen our footprint of local production in China,"" said Dr. Stephan Kothrade, president of Asia Pacific functions and president and chairman of Greater China at BASF.

He said the smart Verbund site will form a solid foundation for a world-class industrial cluster in Zhanjiang and establish stronger business connections between the south China region and other Asian countries.

By 2022, the new engineering plastics compounding plant will supply an additional capacity of 60,000 tonnes per year in China, bringing BASF's total capacity for these products in the Asia Pacific to 290,000 tonnes per year.

The Verbund site in Zhanjiang will be BASF's third production site worldwide, following Ludwigshafen in Germany and Antwerp in Belgium. The new capacity will enable BASF to meet the growing demand of its customers, particularly in the automotive, electronics and new energy vehicles industries.

Zheng Renhao, secretary of the Zhanjiang municipal committee of the Communist Party of China, said the BASF project has shown a strong ability to form an industrial cluster by attracting a large number of upstream and downstream enterprises to Zhanjiang.",China,2019.11
941,Climate Crisis: From Dreams to Hope,"Sustainable trends in business need to focus on facts, rather than on romantic ideas about the environment.

Recent years have seen great progress in awareness of sustainability – in finance, in the boardroom and in leadership. Business and society can’t succeed without it and we are becoming resourceful about certain aspects of sustainability. When it comes to climate change, however, there has been a temptation to lean into a romantic ideal of Mother Nature healing herself with just a bit of nudging from business. This may be viewed as an abdication of responsibility.

Humans are now considered a determining factor on the planet’s geochemical, physical and biological dynamics according to the theory of the Anthropocene era, the start date of which is not yet fixed. Nature has developed amazing adaptation processes that can teach humans how to have a more beneficial impact. These lessons emerge from data, so we owe it to ourselves and future generations to “listen to the scientists” as Greta Thunberg recently exhorted the US Congress.

At a recent event co-sponsored by the Hoffmann Global Institute for Business & Society and the Institut de la transition environnementale, researchers from INSEAD and parts of the greater Sorbonne University Alliance met to discuss sustainability and how they need to be aware of one another to find successful and innovative solutions to climate change, amongst other issues.

Business and ecology academics considered how they could collaborate and work towards clear-eyed solutions to today’s urgent problems. Examples came from olive groves in Spain, examining the profitability of a global seed manufacturer, ecological accounting, carbon sequestration and the circular economy.

A theme that ran through all presentations was the importance of data, not dreams, when tackling important problems. In the circular economy, for example, industries have to prepare for change whilst considering what consumers want now. We can’t wait for that mythical ideal buyer who will recycle and reuse the same product. In ecological terms, the potential loss of rare animals is frightening, but it’s not as devastating as when more common organisms (like pollinators) that are vital to the food chain are threatened.

Business must learn to cope with climate change, starting with agriculture, an industry sometimes perceived at odds with ecologists. Farmers may want only one crop in their fields, but biodiversity is essential. It includes the variety of interconnected plant and animal life in a given habitat that is necessary for that locale. It’s not only important for the environment but also for business; one researcher shared how biodiversity could be a factor in increasing profit.

Business will have to do more with less in the face of climate change. To meet this challenge, companies must use updated, more relevant methods to understand what they are working with.

Denis Couvet, professor of Ecology at France’s National Museum of Natural History, discussed how environmental accounting can work with business. Ecologists have proposed methods and concepts that fit with traditional accounting in order to conceptualise environmental input/output. A push from the UN for the Natural Capital Accounting Project – piloted in Brazil, China, Mexico and other nations – will contribute towards a standard in ecosystem accounting.

Couvet also spoke about agroecology, a type of farming that entails optimal use of natural resources in food production. There are many frameworks to promote agroecology. Amongst them, CoFarming involves ten French start-ups working together with farmers. Some of the proposed best practices include the use of digital resources and the study of life-cycle analyses with digital tools. AgriMind’lab is a coaching platform that invites new farmers to join a community to help them manage their resources.

Wider innovations occur, and not only in Europe. China, for example, has created a ‘payments for ecosystem services’ framework for switching to dry land farming in an attempt to preserve water. Moreover, the Chinese government has created a participatory platform for scientists and farmers to work together. Its structure recognises that there are different kinds of farmers with different skills and needs, as well as opportunities to improve agricultural practices.

How closely should farmers and business stay to natural systems that have tremendous experience (and success) in adapting? The US$50 billion seed industry is trying to make the most efficient products possible and is the cornerstone of global food security, according to INSEAD PhD candidate Utku Serhatli, who presented his work on seed manufacturing in the face of climate change.

His working paper with INSEAD Professors Enver Yucesan and Andre Calmon shows how climate change means the yield variability of corn is expected to increase and that more land will be required to produce less corn over time. The impact of temperature changes, higher CO , more droughts and floods, and stronger hurricanes directly affects seed production. The researchers found that due to the processes associated with creating hybrid seeds, climate change will hurt the supply of low margin seeds more. These types of seeds are typically sold to poor countries. Because of their current development cycle, it’s more profitable for seed manufacturers to ignore low quality seeds.

Of course, this has an impact on food security in developing countries. Rather than relying on seed manufacturing giants to produce hardy seeds, developing nations could consider their own seed development or perhaps participatory seed farming. Natural systems have spent thousands of years improving themselves and should be taken into consideration when creating new ways to feed the global population.

Climate change can have an impact on traditional operational improvement. For instance, one area in which giant seed manufacturing firms invest heavily is data analytics to improve demand forecasting. They are hoping therefore to delay product differentiation (which Serhatli refers to as “postponement”) so that these firms can have visibility with regards to demand before making allocation decisions. The impact of climate change would render these traditional improvements much less effective and further worsen food security in developing countries. In general, climate change might necessitate a paradigm shift in how we approach agriculture, Serhatli said.

Does the solution lie beneath our feet?

Luc Abbadie, a professor of Ecology at Sorbonne Université, described the use and need for carbon sequestration – the removal and storage of carbon (usually carbon dioxide) from the atmosphere into carbon sinks through physical or biological processes. Forests can act as a carbon sink, but it’s important to understand that they can’t take all the excess carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. There must be a balance between emission reduction and carbon sequestration.

Deforestation is dangerous not only because we need trees to offset emissions, but also to retain life-sustaining carbon in the soil. In tropical areas, switching from forest to crops can deplete carbon in the soil within two years; in temperate climates, the loss (so far) takes about 100 years. There is some encouraging news from this sector as carbon was previously thought to reside only in the top level of soil. Tests on deeper samples have found carbon from thousands of years ago in some cases.

To encourage carbon retention in the soil, ecologists suggest modifying an established method. Rather than just incorporating straw into soil, it could be better to integrate straw that’s been sitting around for months. Over time, microorganisms alter the chemistry of straw, which changes the complex relationships between carbon input and carbon accumulation and could result in better carbon accumulation in soil.

Abbadie spoke about the need for a systemic view of the whole of biodiversity with costs and benefits. Nature’s solution – the result of thousands of years of selection – is often very good, but it doesn’t mean that it’s the only one. Whilst capitalising on “natural” knowledge is ideal, industry and society must participate in solving the myriad problems generated by climate change.

Professor of Geography Marianne Cohen presented her work on agricultural activities facing environmental transition in France and Spain, specifically, olive groves. Bucking against the local knowledge that rainfall in the Spanish region of Andalucía was the most important factor in olive oil pricing, Cohen looked at the data and discovered that other factors, including storage from the previous year, were much more important.

In her study, the grove with the lowest biodiversity fetched the lowest price per litre (Sierra Magina, Andalucía). The highest biodiversity was found in French vine regions (Terrasses du Larzac, Bandol) and in the village of Saint-Guilhem-le-Désert, where olive oil is either a niche product or cultivated by amateurs for their own needs.

Ideals from the circular economy were brought to earth by INSEAD Professor Luk Van Wassenhove. The concept of decoupling economic growth from the consumption of the earth’s resources requires assistance from experts in business. Moving from a romantic to a scientific view, Van Wassenhove said that companies need simple analytical tools to evaluate alternative business models.

For the circular economy to be successful, a balance amongst access (logistics, competition), technology (product design for either durability or recycling) and the market (consumers may not be interested in refurbished goods) must be struck. For an effective “circular economy”, industry needs to shift away from pure production towards delivery as a service by linking policy, finance, consumers and business.

It is critical to reduce the uncertainty associated with the circular economy. There are some associations with another new economy – the sharing or gig economy. For companies like Uber and Airbnb, the focus is not production. Despite having raised tremendous amounts in funding, these firms are still not profitable, which puts the concept of “sharing” on shaky ground.

Although we all must live with the changes around us, perhaps executives are best placed to work with climate change, having successfully grappled with mammoth digital disruption and organisational shifts. There is, patently, more on the line this time though. “It’s a question of civilisation,” Abbadie reminded the researchers. As with other disruptions, an open mind is required to see the facts as they are and innovate based on data, not fairy tales about Mother Nature.

992,Coke to complete $1.7 bn investment in 'Fruit Circular Economy',"Global FMCG major Coca-Cola is on track to complete all its investment commitments in India, including the $1.7 billion funding to create a ""Fruit Circular Economy"" meant to aide the Indian agri-ecosystem, a senior company executive told IANS.

The planned investment of $5 billion announced by the company in 2012 is expected to be completed by 2020 for retail infrastructure creation, bottling plants and introduction of new products, amongst others.

Since its re-entry into India in 1993 till 2011, Coca-Cola invested $2 billion in the country. ""We are on track with our investment commitments of $5 billion by 2020. That's on track,"" a senior executive with the beverages major's India arm told IANS.

Additionally, the company has committed an investment of $1.7 billion or more than Rs 11,000 crore towards creating a ""Fruit Circular Economy"" aiding the Indian agri-ecosystem for the next five years till 2023.

""This investments will help catalyse the entire fruit value chain helping take them from the grove to the glass,"" the executive said.

Apart from its planned investments, Coca-Cola India has initiated the next stage of its transformation into a ""growth-oriented, consumer-centred, Total Beverage Company"".

""As part of this journey, we continue to expand our beverages portfolio to provide more choices to our customers across our Indian and global portfolio,"" the executive said.

The company recently set up a new business venture division to incubate and scale-up new businesses.

""This new division is focused on broadening our beverages range so that our portfolio appeals and is available to wider parts of society,"" the executive said.

""One part of the strategy here is to look across Coca-Cola's global portfolio and bring brands to India that we think will resonate with the consumers here, thus offering them more choice,"" the executive added.

Consequently, the beverage major in India entered into new segments, like the niche but potentially high-volume non-alcoholic malt drinks market with its global brand, Barbican.

Other notable additions to its portfolio this year have been Rani Float and Powerade, both of which were brought to India from the company's global portfolio.

""Our 2020 plans include making both Rani Float and Powerade more widely available pan India,"" the executive said.

Besides, the company's India unit is also incubating its own brands, one of them being Aquarius Gluco-charge, which was launched about a year-ago across some parts of the country.

""Other incubations include experimenting in beverages that are more unique to India. Our aim is to be the preferred choice of beverage, no matter what your beverage preference is,"" the executive added.

Globally, Coca-Cola offers over 500 brands in more than 200 countries and territories.

In India, the company offers beverage brands like Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Zero, Diet Coke, Thums Up, Fanta, Fanta Green Mango, Limca, Sprite, Sprite Zero, VIO Flavoured Milk, Kinley and BURN energy drinks, amongst others.

994,"On China, Taiwan must make no mistake - Taipei Times","On China, Taiwan must make no mistake

China’s Taiwan Affairs Office and National Development and Reform Commission on Monday last week announced 26 measures, with 13 directed at Taiwanese businesses and the other half at the Taiwanese public, which are arguably the weakest of the group.

The government must carefully consider the potential influence of these measures on the nation’s business sector, and outline pragmatic and thorough countermeasures.

Beijing’s Jan. 2 version of the “one country, two systems” formula for Taiwan and its 26 measures are systemic actions, as can be seen in the latter’s drafting process. It involved as many as 22 ministries and commissions.

This is a large-scale project aimed at negotiation and integration, and China clearly devoted considerable effort to completing it before the election. Effective or not, China is serious.

The 13 proposals targeting Taiwanese businesses share a common characteristic. They not only point to China’s goals during its next development phase, such as targeting artificial intelligence technologies. They also show that Beijing is paying close attention to Taiwan’s key sectors, including 5G, a strong circular economy achieved through resource recycling and a more advanced financial system.

The measures intended for civil aviation and transportation of passengers and goods, as well as participation in airport construction, appear directed at EVA Airways and China Airlines.

Beijing obviously conducted surveys and research before mapping out these measures, and the possibility that they have talked to “proxy agents” and major Taiwanese enterprises in the process cannot be ruled out.

Given the timing of the announcement, the 26 measures seem to be an attempt at intervening in next year’s presidential and legislative elections, and more importantly, they show that the US-China dispute over supply chains is in full swing.

The Financial Times on Monday last week reported on US discontent over Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co exporting chips to Huawei. The question is what measures Taipei could take to protect its leading semiconductor company, which plays a crucial role in the nation’s economic status.

Failure is not an option. The public wants concrete results and assurances.

The other 13 measures claim to give Taiwanese equal treatment to Chinese, but the real intention is to soften the idea of incorporating Taiwan into China.

Compared with the business-oriented incentives, the measures directed at Taiwanese — such as providing Chinese travel documents and protection from its embassies and consulates in other countries — are focused on the individual and not as urgent.

While Taiwan’s diplomacy suffers from China’s suppression, Beijing can only block official visits by Taiwan’s president and high-level government officials. It can do little to hinder the free movement of Taiwanese abroad.

Taiwan also enjoys visa-exempt entry to more countries than China does, so the offer of a “travel document” is not enticing. Taiwanese have learned the lessons of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement, and China will have to put in considerable effort to sell them something this weak.

While political campaigns ready themselves for the elections, the government must establish a national security team that is trusted by all.

Taipei should talk less and do more by monitoring and responding to Beijing’s moves 24-7, as China may play tricks or take actions beyond these measures.

Taiwan cannot afford even the smallest mistake.

999,Covestro expands open innovation in China,"Covestro is expanding its open innovation with various partners starting from its Asia Pacific Innovation Center in Shanghai with the new concept of ""Open Innovation Hub.""

Covestro is expanding its open innovation, or cross industry innovation with various partners starting from its Asia Pacific Innovation Center in Shanghai with the new concept of “Open Innovation Hub.”

The move comes as the multi-industry ecosystems in China have evolved through open innovation principles that push the boundaries of the traditional industry sectors as well as for industry upgrade.

“China is setting the pace for technologies and solutions in many areas that address future trends, and we see tremendous potential here to engage with different innovation partners,” said Holly Lei, President of Covestro China. “With the Open Innovation concept we take a step forward in implementing our ‘in China, for the world’ innovation strategy.”

The Open Innovation concept will support experts and partners with an infrastructure to work on five important pillars, for example in engaging with designers, start-ups and established customers to explore potential aesthetic and circular design of products.

The new approach enables experts to reach out into the ecosystems to find partners for sustainability topics and circular economy, and helps to build networks for industries and applications where Chinese developments take a leading role such as mobility, robotics, bio-materials and drones.

“We will bundle our open innovation activities under one umbrella now,” said Dr Michael Schmidt, Head of Innovation, Covestro, Asia Pacific. “We strive for a close and intense collaboration with our partners from all kind of industries with the goal to build a leading innovation ecosystem for our customers.”

Covestro has been active in connecting with start-ups, academia such as Tongji University and cross-industry partners even before implementing a branded open innovation concept in China.

Covestro showed its materials for 5G at this year’s K Fair from October 16–23 in Düsseldorf, Germany. The materials are in fact a teamwork fruit, which is benefiting from Covestro’s open innovation concept.

As 5G is going to become the basis for a fully mobile and networked society, it is a key technology for the digitalization of all areas of life and the economy.

The new technology enables close networking of devices such as cell phones, tablets, vehicles, household appliances, industrial plants and many others to form an Internet of Things (IoT).

With the installation of 5G, the demand for base stations, active antenna units (AAU) and other equipment will increase dramatically. Covestro is developing innovative and sustainable material solutions and contributing to a smart infrastructure, including sensor technologies and a digital communication environment.

China is leading in 5G network deployment. Covestro’s global 5G team is working with Southeast University of China on the optimization of radio frequency data transmittance.

In Europe, the company is cooperating closely with Deutsche Telekom and the Umeå Institute of Design. Together with its partners, the company is committed to achieving the materials of choice for 5G technology.

At K Fair, Covestro also showed the running and basketball shoes which were created together with Chinese designer Axis Liu.

“For me new materials are one of the most powerful driving forces for creative shoe design and for exploring new possibilities,” says Axis Liu. “Therefore, I appreciate the know-how of the experts at Covestro and I will continue to benefit from this in the future.”

The cooperation between Liu and the Covestro team resulted in athletic shoe concepts that set standards in many respects. They are highly sustainable and light, yet extremely durable.

Because running shoes are often worn outdoors for several hours at a time, it is particularly important for the upper material to be water resistant and breathable.

For the basketball shoes, it is considered that the feet and bodies of basketball players are more strained in different ways than those of runners.

That’s why there are also differences in the individual components of the materials used.

Besides industries, Covestro expands its open innovation concept to universities and research institutions in China.

Covestro launched “Future Cities Competition” with its long-term partner Tongji University in Shanghai from August 5-9, 2019.

Competition participants were tasked to build a prototype of a future city by utilizing Covestro materials and applying the Internet of Things (IoT) to future homes.

The winner team was invited to K Fair to present their winning ideas.

“For close to a decade, Covestro has been working with Tongji to train young talent to explore innovative and sustainable material solutions,” says Dr Michael Schmidt, also the Dean of the Covestro-Tongji Innovation Academy.

“Through this competition, we look forward to gaining new insights as we accelerate towards tomorrow’s smart living.”

“Engaging and inspiring the next generation to contribute to drive innovation for sustainable urban development is important to us. This is why we are actively reaching out to them and providing a platform where they can share their vision of Future Cities,” he added.

With 2018 sales of 14.6 billion euro (US$16.2 billion), Covestro is among the world’s largest polymer companies. Business activities are focused on the manufacture of high-tech polymer materials and the development of innovative solutions for products used in many areas of daily life.

The main segments served are the automotive, construction, wood processing and furniture, and electrical and electronics industries. Other sectors include sports and leisure, cosmetics, health and the chemical industry itself.

Covestro has about 30 production sites around the globe and as of the end of 2018 employed approximately 16,800 people (full-time equivalents).

China is Covestro’s single largest market, with sales totaling 3.1 billion euro in 2018, accounting for 21 percent of group sales. Covestro’s cumulative investment in China exceeded 3.3 billion euro since 2001.",China,2019.11

11,Tsai has proven her value to nation - Taipei Times,"Tsai has proven her value to nation

President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) is Taiwan’s first female president and the second president from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), after former president Chen Shui-bian (陳水扁).

Following the DPP’s major defeat in the 2008 presidential election, Tsai, then a political outsider, stepped forward and rose to the DPP leadership at a time when courage seemed to be in short supply.

Despite initial losses in the November 2010 New Taipei City mayoral race and the January 2012 presidential election, her intrepidness and endurance finally started to pay dividends.

Under Tsai’s leadership, along with help from the unpopular policies of the then-ruling Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT), the DPP regained momentum in the following general election.

On Jan. 16, 2016, Tsai won the presidency by a landslide, beating her KMT opponent, former New Taipei City mayor Eric Chu (朱立倫), by a margin of 25 percent. Tsai was inaugurated as president on May 20, 2016.

In the past three-and-a-half years, Tsai has demonstrated she is a decent, effective and trustworthy leader. Her proven records in the economic and political realms have set an example for others. She therefore deserves a second term.

The global economy has suffered due to the impact of the US-China trade dispute and Brexit. However, the government has minimized the effects by undertaking an innovative trade and investment initiative named the New Southbound Policy, which Tsai originally proposed in September 2015 as part of her policy platform as the DPP presidential candidate.

The policy was created to reduce Taiwan’s dependence on China, and to improve Taiwan’s cooperation and exchange between 18 selected countries in Southeast and South Asia and Oceania in the areas of the “5 plus 2” innovative industries plan: the “Asian Silicon Valley” project, smart machinery, biotechnology-related projects, green energy, the defense industry, innovative agriculture and the circular economy.

The policy has achieved significant results since it was established on Sept. 5, 2016.

During the first 10 months of this year, The Ministry of Economic Affairs has approved 151 Taiwanese companies’ applications to return to Taiwan to invest a total of NT$623.6 billion (US$20.5 billion) in the manufacturing sector, which is expected to create about 54,970 jobs.

The ministry also said that it expects about NT$200 billion of the approved investments to materialize by the end of this year.

In addition to Taiwanese firms, foreign enterprises have invested heavily in Taiwan this year.

Based on Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates, global foreign direct investment (FDI) has been substantially reduced by 20 percent for the first six months of this year.

However, the inflow of FDI to Taiwan has reached more than US$7 billion, representing a 7 percent increase for the first 10 months of this year.

Taiwan’s GDP has maintained steady progress, with an average annual growth rate of 2.4 percent since 2016. The growth rate for this year is expected to be 2.5 percent, the best among Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong.

The inflow of FDI and return of Taiwanese companies from China should produce positive effects on the Taiwan economy in 2020 and after.

IMF data show that Taiwan’s GDP, measured in nominal US dollars, ranked 21st in the world last year at US$601 billion, and is the eighth-largest economy in Asia, after China, Japan, India, South Korea, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.

However, Taiwan’s GDP per capita adjusted by the purchasing power parity (PPP) in US dollars ranked 15th in the world last year at US$53,023. Taiwan’s PPP-based GDP per capita is larger than Germany’s US$52,559, France’s US$45,775, the UK’s US$45,705, Japan’s US$44,227 and South Korea’s US$41,361, according to the IMF.

Based on UN data of the top creditor nations sorted by their net international investment positions, Taiwan ranked the fifth-largest in the world with US$1,054 billion, less than Japan’s US$2,813 billion, Germany’s US$1,616 billion, China’s US$1,596 billion and Hong Kong’s US$1,309 billion.

Of the 141 economies, Taiwan is ranked the 12th-most competitive economy in the world, and ranked first in macroeconomic stability, according to The Global Competitiveness Report published by the World Economic Forum in October.

Stock market performance is a reflection of a nation’s general economic condition. Taiwan’s stock market capitalization for 2015, the final year of former president Ma Ying-jeou’s (馬英九) tenure, was NT$25 trillion. In the first nine months of this year, it reached NT$32 trillion, a net increase of NT$7 trillion.

The current market value is the highest of the past 30 years. With the 10.46 million shareholders presently in the market, each could potentially gain an estimated NT$276,000, according to an Oct. 23 report in the Liberty Times (the sister newspaper of the Taipei Times).

The daily transaction value of the Taiwan stock market is about NT$105 billion, which is about NT$30 billion larger than that of 2015, and the TAIEX has exceeded 11,000 points, which was never achieved under the Ma administration.

China is the largest single source of tourists for Taiwan and has banned individuals from traveling to Taiwan in an attempt to hurt Tsai and the DPP ahead of the Jan. 11 elections. Despite China’s ban, the number of tourists is expected to reach a target of 12 million through the promotional efforts under the New Southbound Policy.

In geopolitics, Taiwan-US relations have been the best since the establishment of the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979. Tsai has earned the US’ trust. To counter bullying from China, the US Congress passed the Taiwan Travel Act last year, and recently the Taiwan Assurance Act and the TAIPEI Act to promote Taiwan foreign relations, as well as approving the sales of advanced military hardware to protect Taiwan.

Taiwanese are not old, poor and miserable as Kaohsiung Mayor Han Kuo-yu (韓國瑜) has repeatedly said.

On the contrary, they are living well and happy. Based on last year’s Happiness Report published by the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, Taiwan ranked 26th in the world among the 156 countries included in the study.

Taiwan ranked third among Asian countries, after only Israel and the United Arab Emirates. By comparison, Singapore ranked 34th, Malaysia 35th, Thailand 46th, Japan 54th, South Korea 57th, the Philippines 71st and China a distant 86th. In this year’s report, Taiwan moved up a notch to 25th.

Finally, KMT presidential candidate Han is to be Tsai’s major rival in the election.

Han’s rise is attributed to certain factors: a backlash to government reforms, support from local KMT political factions, the pro-China media, and communist China’s “united front” and distribution of unverified media reports, in addition to his own political instincts.

Han is a populist. He did his graduate study in social science in Beijing, and he learned Maoist revolution tactics, such as spreading disinformation and fomenting class struggle. He is also making absurd campaign promises.

Han has proclaimed himself a proletarian, although in reality he is a multimillionaire, not a working-class person.

He used to admit that he loved to drink — frequently and to excess. He likes to fool around, and, of course, he likes to talk about sex. Han never tires of doing that.

Because of this, Han won a stunning victory in the Kaohsiung City mayoral election on Nov. 24 last year. It did not take long for voters to realize that he is ignorant about everything, deceptive and dishonest. Even high-school students question his honesty.

In his presidential campaign, Han has been trying to duplicate his success with the story of the “Kaohsiung Experience.” Nevertheless, people have already woken up and understood that he is untrustworthy. They will not be fooled again.

As the saying goes: “You can fool some of the people all the time, and all the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.”

The most urgent issue for Tsai is to combat misinformation ahead of the elections.

Taiwan would rather be led by a trustworthy Tsai than an untrustworthy Han. Taiwan needs Tsai’s leadership for four more years to protect its sovereignty and maintain national prosperity.

15,China Focus: China import expo offers green solutions - Xinhua | English.news.cn,"SHANGHAI, Nov. 9 (Xinhua) -- Across the venue of the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai, organizers have posted garbage classification guides and offered three types of trash bins labeled ""food waste"", ""residual waste"" and ""recyclable"" to help mandatory garbage sorting. Volunteers are also ready to explain and help.

If visitors fret over the complex garbage sorting process, they might find solutions at the ABB booth. The Swiss tech giant showcases a waste separation robot, which can nimbly put different kinds of trash into different bins.

The robot is part of an AI-powered garbage sorting system. When rubbish is transfered to the video recognition area, the background system immediately does the analysis and identification work and sends real-time instructions to the robot.

""The whole system uses technologies such as robot automation, AI and cloud computing. Through continuous data collection and deep learning, it can do even better sorting work,"" said Liu Qianjin, chief technology officer of ABB China.

Many more companies bring their green solutions to the expo, hoping to cash in on business opportunities in the world's second-largest economy that is focusing more on green growth and environment protection.

Japanese company Itochu exhibits a high-performance waste incineration power generation technology. ""Precise waste separation is very important for improving waste incineration efficiency. We are seeking more partners in China to launch public-private partnership (PPP) projects,"" said Fang Yijie, assistant to general manager of Itochu Shanghai Ltd.

In addition, Itochu shows recyclable clothing materials that can help reduce the consumption of marine-environment polluting polyester fibers. It also brings a kind of plastics-like paper made mainly from limestone that can cut the use of non-renewable oil derivatives.

""Itochu showcased its strengths in various fields at last year's expo, but this year we focus more on products and technologies related to circular economy. Our recent investments are more or less related to green development,"" said Fang.

Asia Pulp & Paper Group (APP) showcases a better waterproof version of the biodegradable material it launched at the first CIIE as well as biodegradable greaseproof wrapper and parchment paper for baking.

""To make the most of the biodegradable materials, people need to be willing to pay slightly higher prices for products beneficial to sustainable development and do the trash sorting work well. Nowadays, increasingly more Chinese people can do both,"" said Zhai Jingli, APP China vice president.

Heng Ju, senior vice president of AECOM China, said global companies are getting more involved in China's sustainable development. ""One of our partners is developing waste degradation technologies, and our mission is to apply these technologies with our better urban planning programs,"" said Ju.

Eyeing China's pursuit of sustainable development and green life, the companies bring a great variety of green products to the second CIIE to seek potential deals, said Yu Dianfan, a professor with Shanghai University of Finance and Economics.

On the third day of the six-day expo, APP signed tentative deals on more than 110 million U.S. dollars worth of degradable products with companies from Shanghai and provinces of Jilin and Zhejiang. AECOM also has signed cooperation agreements with several Chinese companies to explore ecological and environmental-friendly city planning schemes.

China will bring about more cooperation and development opportunities to companies across the world as the country further opens its doors and pushes foreward green development, said Ju.

The State Council Taiwan Affairs Office and the National Development and Reform Commission on Monday unveiled measures to further promote economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan Strait.

Known as the ""26 measures,"" they are effective from the day of their promulgation, according to an official statement.

Thirteen of the 26 measures are about ensuring that enterprises from Taiwan receive the same treatment as those from the mainland, including investing in or participating in projects of major technological equipment, 5G, circular economy, civil aviation, theme parks and new types of financial institutions.

The same treatment for enterprises from Taiwan also applies to policies of financing, trade remedy, export credit insurance, import and export facilitation and standard formulation.

The other 13 measures concern the same treatment for compatriots from Taiwan as those from the mainland, providing further facilitation and support for Taiwan compatriots in areas of consular protection, agricultural cooperation, transportation, telecommunications charges, qualifications for house purchase, culture and sports, professional title evaluation, and admissions and examinations, the statement said.

Building on the ""31 measures"" that the mainland rolled out in February 2018 to promote cross-Strait economic and cultural ties, the latest measures further reflect the mainland's vision of making development people-centered in its Taiwan work, treating Taiwan compatriots as equals and benefiting them in the same way as mainland residents, the statement said.

The 26 measures will further help Taiwan enterprises accelerate technological innovation, reduce overall costs, seize development opportunities and achieve better development, it added.

The new measures will create a better environment and better conditions for Taiwan compatriots to study, work and live, promote integrated development and protect Taiwan compatriots' legitimate rights and interests, according to the statement.",China,2019.11
77,EEC to embrace 'circular economy',"The government is focusing on implementing a circular economy within the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) to make its business and investment more environmentally friendly, according to Kanit Sangsubhan, secretary-general of the EEC Office.

Mr Kanit on Saturday addressed a session of the Asean Business and Investment Summit which is being held in line with the 35th Asean Summit and its Related Summits in Bangkok and Nonthaburi.

The EEC is a special investment zone covering areas in Chachoengsao, Chon Buri and Rayong provinces designed by the government to become a hub for trade and innovation.

Mr Kanit said the government has been cooperating with the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (Unido) to implement a circular economy in the EEC which would see the zone aim to eliminate waste and the continual use and re-use of resources such as through recycling.

84,National Taiwan University and Nespresso laun...,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — National Taiwan University (NTU) is collaborating with a coffee industry giant on applying coffee by-products to agricultural production to provide scientific data for recycling research.

NTU and Swiss coffee brand Nespresso have launched the ""Application of Coffee Grounds in Organic Agriculture"" research project, according to CNA. Residual coffee grounds will be collected by industry actors and sent to the College of Bio-Resources and Agriculture at NTU, whose students will conduct agricultural research with the aim of enhancing the circular economy.

Nespresso said that it has been promoting a free recycling service since 2018. Throughout the country are over 1,300 post offices where anyone can return their used coffee capsules in the mail free of charge. A monthly average of 10 metric tons was recycled in 2018.

The aluminum collected from the capsules is melted down and made into various items. The coffee grounds will now be handed over to NTU as part of the collaboration.

The head of the Department of Agronomy at NTU, Professor Huu-Sheng Lur (盧虎生) told CNA that NTU has various spaces for agricultural production, including greenhouses, flat land, a mountain farm over 2,000 meters above sea level, and its own experimental forest in Xitou in Nantou County. He said that coffee grounds could be applied in these spaces for a variety of different production purposes.

This project will enable researchers to gather new scientific data on soil health and carbon emissions among other things. Coffee by-products can thus be used as a recycling material for agricultural production.

While there are many anecdotal claims about the use of spent coffee grounds in urban farms and gardens, whether applied to the soil directly or after composting, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has found that this practice greatly reduces plant growth.",Taiwan,2019.11
85,PrimaLoft partners with Parley on marine plastic waste,"PrimaLoft, expert in advanced material technology, and environmental network Parley for the Oceans have joined hands to use plastic recovered from remote islands, beaches and coastal communities to make high-performance insulation products. PrimaLoft is the first insulation provider in the textile industry to partner with Parley to use marine plastic waste.According to a report published by the United Nations, 8 million tons of plastic end up in the ocean every year. This enormous amount of plastic pollution has a tremendous impact on marine life, as it costs the lives of 1 million seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals yearly. The economic consequences are also immense. Each year, plastic causes $8 billion in damage to marine ecosystems. Parley and PrimaLoft will take action that will positively impact this significant environmental issue.“This collaboration with Parley is a perfect match. We both have the same goals: reducing the plastic pollution on our planet, especially in the oceans,” said PrimaLoft president and CEO Mike Joyce. “Avoiding the production of new fossil oil-based materials wherever possible is also a top priority. After the launch of PrimaLoft Bio and proving that our fibre is ready to be utilised in a circular economy, this is another important part of our sustainable efforts.”In addition to the material PrimaLoft sources, the company also supports Parley in their projects preventing ocean pollution, all over the world.Parley now operates a pioneering global supply chain and Cleanup Network across 28 countries, intercepting plastic waste from beaches, islands, and in remote coastal communities. In 2015, the first products made with Parley Ocean Plastic put the marine plastic pollution crisis into the spotlight and presented a unique solution to a complex challenge – one that diverges from traditional recycling approaches.“Parley Ocean Plastic is a trademark for a range of premium materials to turn products into Symbols of Change and fund our battle against marine plastic pollution,” comments Cyrill Gutsch, founder and CEO of Parley for the Oceans. “The enormous success of our partnerships with brands like adidas and Stella McCartney, internationally renowned athletes, artists, and entertainers has had a carry-over effect on the whole industry. Recycling is now sexy, desirable and stands for meaningful design. Purpose is the new luxury. Today we welcome PrimaLoft as an official Parley supply chain partner to our global network, adding new high-performance material types to our portfolio and drastically supporting the growth of our movement – for the oceans.”“Using upcycled marine plastic waste to create insulation that meets the high-performance standards customers expect from PrimaLoft presents a unique challenge,” said Joyce. “Sourcing high-quality raw materials is essential to the development of our insulations, and marine plastics are often lacking that level of quality. Together with Parley, our engineers have developed a method that allows for marine plastics to produce insulation products that meet our high-performance standards.”PrimaLoft will also focus efforts to incorporate and implement the Parley AIR (Avoid Intercept Redesign) strategy, ultimately leading to a reduction of the company’s plastic footprint.",India,2019.11
88,"Hong Kong's HKRITA, Gap collaborate on circular economy","The Hong Kong Research Institute of Textiles and Apparel (HKRITA) will work with global apparel retailer Gap Inc. to foster sustainable development of the textile industry. The joint aim is to develop eco-friendly production processes and technology solutions that enable the industry to move from a linear model to a circular model across the life-cycle of textiles.Two initial research areas have been identified: separation of spandex from used garments and denim decolourisation for recycling.Spandex is a common material used to improve the stretch and comfort of fabric. However, the textile industry is currently unable to separate spandex in an eco-friendly and circular manner from blended fabrics like cotton-spandex blend.A research project, which sees HKRITA partnering with creative textile manufacturer Artistic Milliners, is being designed to develop an eco-friendly separation method that removes spandex using bio-solvents.In this way, the separated materials can be re-used by the textile industry, according to an HKRITA press release.The second research area will tackle denim decolourisation, a long-standing problem in the textile industry. Currently, common industry practice involves chemical treatment, but this method can harm fabric properties and create negative environmental impacts. This project will also join hands with Indian denim manufacturer Arvind Limited to develop a physical method to decolour the denim, so that the cotton can be more easily reused or re-dyed.The duration of the two research projects will be 24 months and the technologies developed from them will be open for licensing.Established in 2006, HKRITA is funded by the Innovation and Technology Commission of the Hong Kong government and hosted by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.",India,2019.11
