36,Will Indian Cities Start Paying for Bus Tickets With Plastic Bottles? Quite Possible!,"We live in a world which is mostly concentrated on make, use, and dispose. This, loosely referred to as linear economy, ensures that we walk towards an impending mass destruction of the planet where the natural habitats would be choking with plastic and other toxic industrial waste very soon.

However, all may not be lost after all. While many organisations follow the destructive path of a linear economy, growing awareness regarding the environment has led to the development of a concept called 'circular economy'.

Broadly speaking, a 'circular economy' model ensures that Earth's continually repleting natural resources are put to minimal use to sustain them for future generations It is not only limited to daily-use recycling products but goes deeper by attempting to ensure that organisations recreate products which can make their recycling easier or unnecessary. This model of economy would not only ensure less consumption of non-renewable resources but ensure their sustainability for future generations.

On Wednesday, Chairman of the Mahindra group, Anand Mahindra shared a video from the World Economic Forum which detailed the accounts of four cities that let the public pay for public transport with plastic waste.

Beijing allows commuters to pay for the metro ticket with plastic bottles at a special ticket machine. In an Indonesian city, buses accept payment through plastic bottles and not cash. In Surabaya, again in Indonesia, passengers pay with recycling and get two hours of travel. In Istanbul, meanwhile, people can exchange their plastic waste for credit on their metro cards which can be used on different forms of public transport. Sydney has high-tech reverse vending machines where recycling gets you rewards like movie tickets or bus tickets.

Talking about recycling laying the foundation for a circular economy, Mahindra wondered which Indian city would be the first to take a similar initiative, tagging Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Andhra Pradesh CM N. Chandrababu Naidu, asking them whether they would implement this model in Indore and Amravati respectively.



Thanking the chairman for his suggestion, CM Shivraj informed that the state of Madhya Pradesh does have several plastic bottle recycling machines, however, his (Mahindra) suggestion was a good idea and the CM promised to take this up in a future meeting.

Several other users too hailed the idea and even offered their suggestions.",India,2018.09
61,"Interview: China, EU's interests have been closely intertwined: ambassador - Xinhua | English.news.cn","BRUSSELS, Dec. 29 (Xinhua) -- Despite some ""growing pains"", the relations between China and the European Union (EU) have made important progress in 2018, and the interests of the two sides have been closely intertwined, Ambassador Zhang Ming, head of the Chinese Mission to the EU, told Xinhua in a recent exclusive interview.

In the year of 2018, which marks the 15th anniversary of the establishment of the China-EU Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, the relations between the two sides have maintained a steady growth momentum, with scope of cooperation being expanded and interests further integrated, among others, Zhang said.

In the past year, the 20th China-EU leaders' meeting was successfully held. Leaders of many European countries, including Britain, France and Germany, together with about 10 commissioners of the European Commission and more than 50 members of the European Parliament have visited China.

""Such frequent high-level exchanges have enhanced mutual trust and injected new political impetus into the development of China-EU relations,"" Zhang noted.

In the economic and trade sector, bilateral trade volume has grown rapidly to a new height this year. The two sides also exchanged offers of bilateral investment treaty, agreed to end the negotiation of the Agreement on Geographical Indications in a timely manner, and signed new cooperation agreements on circular economy, blue partnership and customs cooperation.

China-EU relations are bearing more significance on the global level, Zhang added. ""China and the EU have more common words in supporting multilateralism and improving global governance; They also issued a joint statement on climate change while maintaining close communication on such global and regional hot issues as the Iranian nuclear and Syria.""

In addition, China and the EU have deepened their cooperation on the Belt and Road initiative, Zhang said. With a growing positive voice within the Union, the EU's recognition and understanding of the initiative are more objective thanks to their deepened political consensus and more fruitful cooperation.

During the 20th China-EU leaders' meeting and the 12th Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) summit, China and the EU reached important consensus on synergizing connectivity between the Belt and Road initiative and the EU Strategy on Connecting Europe and Asia. Many Chinese and European companies have cooperated in third-party markets including Asia and Africa to carry out major projects in infrastructure, energy, environmental protection and finance.

The pragmatic results of China and the EU in 2018 are inseparable from the positive attitude of the EU in developing cooperation with China. The EU's objective voice toward China is rising. And with a greater expectation, the EU is more active in making strategic plan for the development of bilateral relations, Zhang noted.

""China appreciates the EU's positive stance on developing bilateral relations and is willing to meet the EU halfway, hoping that the Union could match its words to deeds, respect China's core interests and major concerns, and develop bilateral relations in a fair, equitable, open and win-win manner,"" Zhang said.

Meanwhile, the year 2019 is important to both sides as it marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the European Parliament election.

""Amid rising protectionism and unilateralism on the global arena, China and the EU have a greater responsibility to promote bilateral relations, enhance mutually beneficial cooperation for the good of the two peoples while continuously adhering to multilateralism, so as to deal with the uncertainty of the global situation with stable bilateral relations,"" said the ambassador.

""The interests of China and the EU have been closely intertwined, but the potential for cooperation needs to be further explored,"" Zhang said.

For now, EU's investment in China accounts for 4 percent of its total external investment stock, while China's investment to the EU only takes up 2 percent of the latter's foreign investment, according to the ambassador.

""There is still pretty much room left to expand bilateral cooperation,"" he said.

Talking about the differences between China and the EU on some specific issues, Zhang said that given their different history, culture, national conditions and developing levels, it is normal to have different views.

China and the EU have a solid foundation of political mutual trust, long-standing economic complementarities. As long as the two sides uphold the spirit of mutual respect, working together for mutually beneficial results, the ""growing pains"" will eventually be solved, Zhang said.",China,2018.12

68,Your Christmas tree could help save the planet,"LONDON-Your unwanted Christmas tree could be processed to produce important chemicals and cut emissions, say researchers.

Pine needles could provide feedstock to create new products, such as sweeteners and paint, as well as cut emissions.

Currently, an estimated seven million trees each year end up in landfill.

A study from the University of Sheffield suggests the process would also result in zero waste, therefore easing pressure on our waste services.

""By now we all know about the problem of greenhouse gas emissions, and the need to reduce carbon emissions,"" explained Cynthia Kartey, a PhD student at the university's Department of Chemical and Biological Engineer

""I see biomass waste as a potential alternative source of feedstock for the chemical industry, for example,"" she told BBC News.

For example, some of the substances found in pine needles are an active ingredient in perfume.

However, by identifying the value from the trees in the form of the potential feedstock for the chemical industry would make it economically sensible to send them to biorefineries, says MissKartey.

This could also lead to a reduction in the UK's carbon footprint as it would cut our dependency on imported plastic trees and a reduction in the amount of tree biomass ending up in landfill, she explained.

Colleague Dr James McGregor added: ""The use of biomass - material derived from plants - to produce fuel and chemicals currently manufactured from fossil resources will play a key role in the future global economy.

""If we can utilise materials that would otherwise go to waste in such process, thereby recycling them, then there are further benefits.""",Pakistan,2018.12
81,"News Analysis: ""Green"" priorities go local in Italy with plans to transform ex-power plants - China.org.cn","You are here:

ROME, Dec. 27 (Xinhua) -- Italy's slow-moving transition away from traditional fuel resources is speeding up on a local level as the process begins to convert a handful of power stations into low environmental-impact facilities with innovative new uses.

The country's former state energy monopoly, Enel, is spearheading the project, which is starting out on two out-of-use plants -- Portoscuso, a former oil-fired plant on the island of Sardinia, and Campomarino, a gas turbine plant in the southern region of Molise.

Enel has identified two-dozen total projects across the country that are in some stage of transition. One is a former mining project and the other 23 ex-power plants.

In a statement, Enel called the larger transformation initiative -- dubbed the ""Futur-e"" strategy -- the company's ""most important and ambitious circular economy project.""

The phrase ""circular economy"" is shorthand for a system that minimizes waste by making systems more efficient, reusing as much as possible, and recycling byproducts.

The idea is not new: The Tate Modern museum in London, the Caixa Forum Cultural Center in Madrid, and Lisbon's Tejo Electricity Museum are all housed in what were once urban power stations.

But what is unusual about the projects in Italy, according to Edoardo Zanchini, national vice-president for the largest Italian environmental lobby group Legambiente, is that most of the 23 plants Enel is seeking for transition are comparatively isolated or in under-developed areas -- in contrast to the projects in Britain, Spain, and Portugal, which are located on valuable real-estate in each country's capital.

""It's an ambitious initiative,"" Zanchini told Xinhua. ""Of the 24 separate projects, some are organized better than others. But together they will result in a major environmental step forward for Italy.""

Portoscuso and Campomarino are the furthest along of the 24 projects, with companies or other entities vying to head the transformation plans required to submit a formal submission of interest early in 2019. Ten more are plants that are approaching a similar phase of development.

Each proposal will be evaluated by specially appointed commissions made up of local stakeholders, academics, analysts and representatives from Enel. Tenders will be judged based on specific needs of the surrounding community, the innovativeness of the proposal, adherence to the guidelines of the ""circular economy"" as well as the long term social, economic and environmental sustainability of the ideas.

Enel officials said the former power plants could be transformed into a wide array of other uses, including low environmental-impact smart villages, recreation sites, shopping areas and Internet technology centers.

Francesco Ferrante, a former senator and co-founder of Green Italia, an advocacy group, told Xinhua the usefulness of the projects goes beyond the specific benefits of individual projects.

""There are obvious environmental benefits of making better use of each plant,"" Ferrante said. ""But there is also very important symbolic value, showing that Italy and a major utility like Enel are taking environmental priorities seriously."" Enditem",China,2018.12
82,How the fashion industry doubled down on sustainability in 2018,"The issue of sustainability took centre stage in the fashion industry in the year 2018, with multiple brands making pragmatic steps to addressing their environmental impact. We take a look at some of the biggest strides made.

PVH, the company that owns Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein and Speedo, signed not one but three major initiatives this year in a bid to reduce the waste generated by its fashion brands and the industry in general.

The group joined the Global Fashion Agenda (GFA), a non-profit initiative that aims to boost sustainability levels within the fashion business, teamed up with Fashion For Good (FFG), an organisation that supports startups in becoming more sustainable, and became a core partner and member of the Advisory Board of The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which works with businesses, government and academia to accelerate and promote a transition to a circular economy.

Denim brand Guess has had a troubled year, but its focus on sustainability remained strong, with the launch of a circular fashion recycling program dubbed ‘Resourced’.

The concept offers US shoppers in-store discounts when they donate used clothing, in an effort to give secondhand pieces new life, and reduce textile waste. The company plans to roll it out globally by 2020.

Gap Inc – which counts Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic on its books – pledged this year to save 10 billion liters of water by the end of 2020.

The fashion conglomerate aims to economise on water resources by focusing on product innovation and improving efficiency at its fabric mills and laundries, and hopes that the initiative will help affected communities achieve better access to clean water and sanitation.

This month, the luxury fashion and lifestyle conglomerate Kering announced the launch of the ‘Sustainable Innovation Award’ – a new fashion prize in China.

Launched in partnership with the innovation platform Plug and Play, the award will single out innovative startups and technologies in Greater China that are offering a positive environmental and social impact by focusing on raw materials, green supply chain concepts and the circular economy, in an attempt to encourage sustainably-minded fashion processes.

Three winners will receive mentorship and networking opportunities to develop their concepts.

This month also saw 43 fashion businesses, including Burberry, H&M, Stella McCartney and Hugo Boss, commit to fighting climate change with the signing of a new “Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action”, a UN Climate Change initiative.

The charter aims to address the role of the fashion industry “on both sides of the climate equation” – meaning that it will focus on the ways in which the sector can reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and focus on sustainable development via 16 different commitments.

Its goal is for the industry to achieve net zero emissions by the year 2050.",Singapore,2018.12

Or for that matter, a cheela made of drumstick leaves by another group might give you nutrition, taste and aesthetic pleasure. So many farmers and entrepreneurs have brought different traditional and new dishes. Painting dry cotton balls in different colours is a children idea from dendhuki. You can visit Sattvik tomorrow and also on 25th to partake satvik food, ingredients, crafts are on display by 50 women groups supported by Ministry of Women and Child Development from Jammu and Krishna, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Uttarakhand, Bihar and so any more places.

Children are enjoying the innovation maze designed by GIAN team. Children have to find their way out and when they get lost, they find a new innovation. Should not we all get lost some time if that helps us discover innovations. There is a photo shoot site nearby on a designer cycle rickshaw and also a children creativity spot near GIAN maze. Come and get lost.

It in addition to this, we have tried to add more meaningful cultural activities this time including a poetry session chaired by Shri Raghuveer Chaudhary, a distinguished Jianpeeth awardee. Sessions by eminent doctors on preventive health including by ayurvedic experts, physiotherapist, orthopaedic experts, diabetic specialists etc., are also there.

There were several policy advocacy sessions on behalf of organic farmers and start-ups. Some of the suggestions we made are: a) there should be open access space in every city for farmers to sell their organic produce directly to consumers; b) just as start-ups, generally from urban areas, have been given five years of relief from a lot of procedural requirements, organic farmers should also be allowed for at least ten years to sell their products without too many restrictions and requirements; c) farmers income cannot be increased without reducing costs. One way is to reduce the cost of inputs by using herbal pesticides and growth promoters. SRISTI has perhaps the only lab dedicated to develop such products and test their efficacy. We need many more such well-equipped labs in the country to promote sustainable agriculture; d) dissemination of sustainable practices through kisan call centre must become obligatory. AT this stage they just promote chemical including some which are banned in many other countries; e) the start-ups should share their failures and set back to help budding entrepreneurs in charting their future path; f) not many states have included the stories of innovators from and for grassroots in the textbooks and curriculum; how will a culture of innovation evolve in the true terms, g) the support from regulatory agencies need a lot of strengthening. The motorcycle based and now chahsis based santi, multipurpose agri machine sis still not eligible for to approval and thus is illegal in the strict sense of the terms Every year Gujarat itself has a sale of about ten thousand santis, all illegal but all legitimate. On one had government has a policy of promoting circular economy but on the other, it will not approve solutions using second-hand parts.

I hope we will hear from many of you in coming two days more suggestions to make the eco-system for promoting women based enterprises, organic agriculture, farmer-consumer interface and promotion of innovations for and from grassroots. We will pursue many more ideas at the fourth International conference by the Honey Bee Network on Creativity and Innovation at IIMA January 28-30, 2019.

The twin-city forum between Taipei and Shanghai opens today in Taipei, focusing on economic issues with the circular economy as its theme, Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je (柯文哲) said yesterday.

Held annually by the cities since 2010, the two-day forum has sparked controversy because of China’s suppression of Taiwan in the international community, but Ko said that as long as economics, rather than politics, remained the center of discussion, there were unlikely to be any disputes.

Ko was responding to comments by Mainland Affairs Council Minister Chen Ming-tong (陳明通), who had earlier yesterday said he hoped the forum would not stir up any political turmoil.

Chen said inter-city exchanges across the Taiwan Strait were in line with the council’s policies and he looked forward to seeing the forum proceed smoothly and yield positive results.

Ko agreed, saying that the forum should pay more attention to economic affairs “so that the event generates fewer disputes and proceeds more smoothly.”

Shanghai Vice Mayor Zhou Bo (周波) arrived at Taipei International Airport (Songshan airport) at about 11:30am leading a 135-member delegation.

They were confronted outside the airport by pro-independence protesters holding up banners that read: “Taiwan, China: one country on each side,” and shouting slogans.

However, they were confined to an “opinion expression zone” set up by police.

The Taipei Police Department dispatched about 600 police officers to the airport for crowd control.

Chilly Chen (陳峻涵), office director of the 908 Taiwan Republic Campaign, was dragged out of the airport by police.

Given the nature of the forum, Zhou should limit his discussion to exchanges between the two cities, Chilly Chen said.

“Do not think about doing ‘united front’ [work] here,” he added.

Zhou is participating in the forum on behalf of Shanghai Mayor Ying Yong (應勇), who was unable to attend because of scheduling conflicts.

The Shanghai official told those awaiting his arrival that the forum is the most important mechanism for exchanges across the Strait, and that he expected those in his delegation to make new friends and gain new knowledge.

Shanghai has launched a plan to position itself as a global financial, shipping and technology hub by 2035, Zhou said, adding that he was looking forward to sharing with Taipei counterparts experiences in urban development.

Keynote speeches about the circular economy are to be presented by Taipei Department of Urban Development Commissioner Lin Jou-min (林洲民) and Shanghai Municipal Development and Reform Commission Vice Director Zhou Qiang (周強), the Taipei City Government said.

Cultural development, urban renovation and environmental protection would also be covered, the city government said, adding that the two cities would sign three memorandums of understanding on cooperation.

After his arrival yesterday, Zhou visited power management solution provider Delta Electronics Inc (台達電), one of Taiwan’s biggest high-tech companies.

The city government last night hosted a banquet to welcome the Shanghai delegation.",Taiwan,2018.12

Citibank Taiwan is honored to have been presented with the Best Social Responsibility Award at the Taiwan Banking and Finance Best Practice Awards — known as the Oscars of the financial sector — which was hosted by the Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance in Taipei on Friday.

Having worked in the region for more than half a century, Citibank Taiwan not only wishes to be the best for our clients, but also wishes to embody this spirit when promoting corporate social responsibility for the company.

Citibank Taiwan’s promotion of corporate social responsibility would be made manifest in four fields: connection, inspiration, trust and innovation, Citibank Taiwan chairman Paulus Mok (莫兆鴻) said.

When it comes to corporate social responsibility, Citibank Taiwan no only seeks to surpass charity, but also anticipates to be the mover of social progression, Mok said.

As a leading figure in the financial sector, Citibank Taiwan aspires to take corporate social responsibility standards to a global level. With the UN’s 17 sustainable development goals (SDG) in mind, Citibank Taiwan attained 11 of them from 2016 to last year. This allows local companies to connect with the international community in the development of corporate social responsibility.

Citibank Taiwan has not only answered a call from the Executive Yuan’s Environmental Protection Administration to develop a circular economy and to cut down on plastics, but has also promoted the Financial Supervisory Commission’s Financial Inclusion System by offering financial management education, a strength of the bank.

With the administration and non-governmental organizations (NGO), including the Chi Sing Eco-conservation Foundation, the Taiwan Toy Library Association, the Taiwan Environmental Protection Union and the Homemakers United Foundation, Citibank Taiwan is dedicated to promoting a circular economy.

Adhering to the ideal of “reduce, recycle and reuse,” Citibank Taiwan employees, along with NGO partners, schools and the public, it can attain the goal of reducing plastic production.

Citibank Taiwan is also working closely with NGO partners to foster correct ideas of finance for young people through talks, workshops and consultation meetings.

With Citibank Taiwan’s Pathways to Progress program — one of many the bank has embarked on to foster vocational capabilities among young people — the company hopes to provide fresh graduates not only with a vision for the future, but also foster capabilities to help them become upstanding members of society.",Taiwan,2018.12
178,Urban Mining Has The Potential To Unlock India’s E-Waste Economy,"India’s consumer electronics market is one of the biggest in the world. While this augurs well for the state of the economy, it also leads to a huge amount of EEE – electronic and electrical equipment that gets discarded, better known as e-waste. With external factors such as hyped up Black Friday sales and government led Make in India policies leading to further device proliferation, e-waste levels are only going to rise further. Reports say that India will touch 3 million tons of e-waste by the end of 2018, and this is only the beginning.

The evolution of components used in these products is a fascinating field of study. However, devices are getting smaller and this hyperconvergence is leading to more minerals and components being packed closer together. Everything from the display to the circuit boards are made of precious metals. A single mobile phone contains all kinds of minerals such as Palladium, Copper, Silver, Gold and more – all of which have a huge aftersales market that is overlooked if people don’t dispose of their e-waste properly. Traditionally, people have discarded their e-waste through ‘kabaadi-walas’, a highly unorganized sector that involves dangerous manual labor and ineffective safety standards.

This is where urban mining comes into the picture. Urban mining is being called sustainability’s latest battleground, and in emerging countries such as India, this can play a huge role in environmental sustainability. Urban mining details the reclamation of secondary resources from urban waste and obsolete materials. In China, for instance, urban mining is providing a solution to the country’s resource crisis to meet its manufacturing needs and reduce its resource shortage. There’s no reason why such a solution cannot be successfully applied in India as well.

When it comes to the salvage of resources and precious metals, urban mining has immense potential. Research shows that $21 billion worth of materials can be saved through effective urban mining. The strategic implementation of urban mining plans can turn a city into a source for raw materials such as Iron, Copper, Aluminum, Lead and more. Not only can these minerals be used for further industries and processes, they can also be removed from the ground to prevent water and air contamination that leads to long-term health ailments.

But this can only be possible if e-waste is disposed in the right manner and reaches the right parties who know how to extract these minerals. Just how urban mining is providing a solution to China’s resource crisis, it can help India overcome its mineral resource shortage and reduce dependence on foreign imports to meet its manufacturing needs. With so many electronic devices in use throughout the country, we already have a readymade substitute for reducing the nation’s import bill, lowering the environmental burden and encouraging the ‘circular economy’.

A report from IIM Bangalore talks about the implications of urban mining in the context of building sustainable cities in India. Since the objective of urban mining is essentially safeguarding the environment and promoting resource conservation, its relevance in India cannot be underestimated. India is one of the largest consumers of materials in the world, and this demand can be substantially met by following the philosophy of reuse, reduce and recycle when it comes to e-waste and the materials within it.

E-waste thus represents a multi billion-dollar industry for the country, so long as e-waste is placed in the right channels. Urban mining represents a great opportunity for everyone to come together and make a lasting impact. As the collective goal of the nation is to enhance resource recovery and promote efficient consumption, end-to-end urban mining projects hold the key to a sustainable future. Effectively done, it can help shift the country away from import-heavy policies and reduce negative impacts on the environment caused by precious metals that are causing more damage than we can imagine. Thus, it is our collective responsibility to propagate the concept of urban mining in the country.",India,2018.12

The Circular Plastics Alliance will make efforts to improve the economics and quality of plastics recycling in Europe. Matching between supply and demand for recycled plastics is found to be the main obstacle to a well-functioning EU market of recycled plastics.

The launching of the Circular Plastics Alliance will contribute to achieving at least 10 million tons of recycled plastics into new products on the EU market by 2025.

“Close cooperation within and between all the links in the plastics value chain is essential if we are to achieve a true circular plastics economy and ensure that recycled plastics find their way to new products, instead of into landfills or the incinerators”, said, Frans Timmermans, First Vice President responsible for sustainable development. He, added, “The Circular Plastics Alliance aims to facilitate this cooperation, building on the commitments the plastics industry has already made and encouraging even more ambitious action. Europe already leads this, and Europe will be the first one to reap the benefits as well. This is the best way to show the world that circular plastic economy is good for the business and good for the environment.”

Jyrki Katainen, Vice-President, responsible for Jobs, Growth, Investment and Competitiveness, commented, “European industry has already clearly committed to more sustainable plastics with the pledges that they have submitted to the Commission. Business understands this is an opportunity to innovate and to become global frontrunners in new technology and materials, in line with circular economy logic.”",India,2018.12
232,"Italy making improvement in trash treatment, but still lags behind neighbors - Xinhua | English.news.cn","ROME, Dec. 11 (Xinhua) -- Italy continues to trail the European Union (EU) as a whole on waste treatment, though the country is closing the gap with its European neighbors, according to a recent key report released by the technical and research branch of Italy's Ministry of Environment.

The Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research -- best known by its Italian initials, ISPRA -- told lawmakers on Monday that while Italy has made strides toward what is known as the ""circular economy"", there was still much to do.

The ""circular economy"" seeks reducing the amount of waste products create, making products last longer before being discarded, and then recycling the waste that is created to produce new goods or energy without extracting new natural resources.

Italy has been among the European Union's laggards when it came to effectiveness in reducing and effectively disposing of waste. The ISPRA report indicated that is beginning to change.

ISPRA's 27th annual report on urban waste was its most comprehensive yet, measuring waste production and disposal in urban areas in all 20 Italian regions all set out in a report totaling more than 600 pages.

Overall, urban waste production in Italy has more or less plateaued in recent years: oscillating over the last five years from a low of 29.52 million metric tons of waste to a high of 30.11 million tons. The total for 2017 -- the latest year covered by the report -- was 29.59 million, a decline of 1.7 percent compared to the previous year and virtually identical as in 2013.

That decline was more or less consistent across the country, with just four of 20 regions showing an increase in waste production between 2016 and 2017.

On a per-capita basis, Italy produced a total of 497 kilograms of waste per resident per year, only slightly higher than the average for the European Union as a whole.

But when it comes to disposing of that waste in low- impact ways, the data told a different tale: 55.5 percent of the waste in Italy is separated by categories, up slightly compared to the previous year, well below EU averages.

""All the regions have taken a step forward and for the first time the amount of differentiated waste totals more than 55 percent,"" Stefano Laporta, ISPRA president, said Monday. ""But there is no room to be complacent.""

Salvatore Micillo, undersecretary with the Ministry of Environment, and Stefano Vignaroli, president of parliament's Commission on the Circular Economy, also spoke at the presentation of the ISPRA report, making similar remarks.

Organic waste in Italy totaled 6.6 million tons, an increase of just 1.6 percent compared to 2016, the smallest year-on-year increase since 2010. The amount of incinerated waste totaled 5.3 million tons, down around 2.5 percent compared to the previous year, but also higher than European averages. The recovery of packaging waste was around 78 percent in 2017, stable compared to 2016.",China,2018.12
249,Thai water sports company wants to take back its historical emissions,"Feeling remorseful about the environmental impact of his company, Svein Rasmussen is on a mission to make amends for all the emissions it has produced in 25 years of operations.

The Norwegian national began offsetting his company’s annual emissions through a mangrove tree planting project in Thor Heyerdahl Climate Park in Myanmar four years ago, he told Eco-Business in a recent interview about Starboard, his Bangkok-based business that produces water sports equipment such as paddleboards and windsurfers.

“We’re reducing between 15 and 20 per cent of our emissions, but reductions are incremental and will not get us to zero carbon. But when you plant mangrove trees, that’s when you get momentous change,” Rasmussen said.

Mangrove trees, which grow in coastal areas in saltwater, have been found to remove up to five times as much carbon dioxide from the air as rainforest trees, storing it in their leaves, branches and in the soil.

Starboard has been planting mangroves to offset an amount of carbon dioxide 10 times the size of its annual footprint, with the ultimate aim of taking back every kilogram of carbon it has ever released. It has planted 140,000 trees in the park so far.

“It’s hard to go back in time, so all we can do is estimate our footprint from the last 25 years and plant enough trees to see that it is taken care of,” explained Rasmussen.

The company last month mooted the idea of a plastic bag fee at an Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting in Bangkok, and organises clean-ups of waterways in Bangkok. “Oceans are filling up so quickly that we don’t have time for the usual [slow] evolution of policies,” he stressed. “We want to connect with any major influencing party, from the military to the chamber of commerce, to fast track the evolution of plastic regulations.”

At the same time, the company is getting its house in order when it comes to plastic use. Starboard joined the Plastic Disclosure Project by the non-profit Ocean Recovery Alliance, under which companies measure the amount of plastic they use and aim to reduce it in the long term. Starboard ran a plastic audit last year.

“When we did the calculations, it dawned on me that most of the boards and products that we make come from fossil fuels,” he told Eco-Business. “The paint, the mat on top of the paddleboard, the resins—all of it.”

Ninety per cent of the raw materials the company used in production were derived from these finite resources. “That means 90 per cent of our profits come from fossil fuels even though we don’t use single-use packaging. I felt very guilty,” said the Norwegian-born water sports enthusiast.

This drove Starboard to look for ways to reduce its plastic use and carbon footprint, and enable other organisations to do the same.

Last year Starboard launched what it calls the world’s first Plastic Offset Programme in partner with the Ocean Recovery Alliance, encouraging other firms to take a hard look at and improve their plastic use.

The company assigned a financial value to the social and environmental cost of using plastic, and channeled that money into a fund for research and development and supported non-government organisations that combat ocean plastic.

“We have created a fund based on the plastic used in our products, which we will invest back into projects that protect the ocean—our greatest resource and the big blue playground for paddlers and windsurfers worldwide,” said Rasmussen in a statement.

Starboard also searched for better ways to manufacture its products and reuse plastic. Even if an item is made of durable plastic, companies need to consider how these can be disposed of at the end of their lifespan, Rasmussen said.

“We need to look at how we can reduce the amount of plastic that goes into a product, how the plastic can come from recycled or bio sources, and what is an acceptable end of life system for it,” he elaborated.

Plastic has come under the spotlight in the last two years as the social and environmental impacts of the miracle material of the 20th century became increasingly clear to the general public.

Microplastics, formed when plastic waste is carried out to sea and broken up into smaller pieces, is consumed by sea life that forms part of the human food chain. The tiny bits of plastic were recently found in human excrement for the first time.

Plastic pollution is also killing marine life including, most recently, a sperm whale that was found washed up on a beach in Indonesia with more than 1,000 pieces of plastic in its stomach.

Earlier this year Starboard announced that it had begun manufacturing parts of its products with plastic salvaged from discarded fishing nets, leading to a 14.4 per cent drop in the company’s emissions through a partnership with DSM.

The Dutch multinational works with coastal communities in India who collect, clean and process the nets so they can be converted back into plastic material called Akulon Repurposed that is sold to manufacturers for production.

Around 2,000 tonnes of nets are collected and recycled each year through DSM’s programme, which has created jobs for 300 individuals in low-income coastal communities, said Matt Gray, commercial director for Asia Pacific at DSM Engineering Plastics.

It’s a drop in the ocean compared to the 640,000 tonnes of nets that make up 10 per cent of all plastic waste in the sea. Explaining the focus on fishing nets, Gray told Eco-Business that fishing nets are a good source of plastic because they are made of nylon, a material that DSM already makes.

“It’s a true circular economy. We use nylon-based fishing nets and fishing lines, and we’re pulling the material back out of the environment,” he said.

Fishing nets are also easy to clean and recycle, while general plastic waste is easily contaminated and therefore unusable, he added. “It is necessary to capture as much value from waste streams as possible, which is an idea that’s central to the concept of a circular economy.”

The Akulon Repurposed feedstock DSM produces may be reinforced with glass - depending on how the feedstock is intended to be used - to ensure that the materials perform to the same levels as new plastic, and already outdoes other forms of recycled nylon available in the market, said Gray.

Besides using upcycled plastic, Starboard replaced 33 per cent of the fossil fuel-based resin it needs with a recyclable, plant-based bioresin that resulted in a 20.7 per cent reduction in carbon emissions. The manufacturer’s plastic usage totalled 317.96 tonnes in 2017, which fell to 298.5 tonnes by 2018.

Does Rasmussen foresee a world that could be completely plastic free?

“Let’s put it like this—plastic will always be there, but in a more useful way, like prosthetic limbs. It is silly to use such a fantastic material for single-use items,” he said.

Rasmussen added: “We also need to think about [recycling waste] differently. DSM is are doing what we’ve needed to do for a long time, namely retrieve the waste in nature today and find an economic model that works.”",Singapore,2018.12
251,IMF wants Pakistan to tackle circular debt: Questions failure to fully implement last strategy to,"ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) in consultation with other multilateral creditors has asked Pakistan to come up with a comprehensive strategy for tackling Rs1.3 trillion circular debt on short, medium and long-term basis.

The Fund has also asked as to why the last strategy for ending circular debt could not be fully implemented after completion of the programme in November 2016. “Reversal of policies and lackluster attitude on reform path has played havoc with the country’s economy,” the IMF and Pakistan team agreed during the parleys and then both sides evolved a consensus for preparing a new strategy to stop unbearable losses for the cash-bleeding power sector.

“The total amount of circular debt has gone around Rs1.3 trillion and the government is preparing a comprehensive strategy to tackle both stocks and flows of circular debt,” top official sources confirmed to The News on Saturday. The stocks of circular dent stood at Rs582 billion and flow at Rs690 billion and this amount is increasing every month. This amount of circular debt, they said, might have gone on higher side because this loss was piling up on a monthly basis.

“We are preparing a strategy which will be firmed up within one and a half months,” said top official sources. Now the strategy, they said, was focusing on tackling finding ways for subsidy provided to the AJK government on power as well as to Balochistan on tube wells.

The IMF team that visited Pakistan in November last seriously took up the issue of circular debt and argued that the policy of tackling circular debt was reversed in the aftermath of completion of the last Fund program as it stood at just around Rs350 billion which had now peaked to around Rs1.3 trillion. “The reversal of policies on many fronts is the main cause of existing quagmire which Pakistan’s economy is witnessing currently,” the IMF team assessed and endorsed by Ministry of Finance during the parleys. The loose fiscal policy had also put pressures on external front of economy but the overvalued exchange rate proved disastrous for the economy. On circular debt, the IMF assessed that the strategy to tackle circular debt lost its steam resulting into piling up of this monster again after November 2016. “Now Pakistan will have to undertake a comprehensive package, including rationalisation of tariff, plugging leakages, allowing Nepra to notify and implement determined tariff automatically and improving governance structure to overcome woes of cash bleeding power sector,” the IMF prescription given to Pakistan suggests.

When contacted, one top official of Power Division said the government had instructed them to prepare a strategy on this front and this task was underway not on the demand of the IMF but the government considered it in the best interest of the sector to implement all actions required to avoid piling up of circular debt up to such an extent in future.

The IMF sources said Pakistan will have to undertake short, medium and long-term policies to improve its economy.

They said parleys would continue between the two sides to strike consensus at staff level agreement, as it is the only way for presenting Pakistan’s case before the Fund executive board in months ahead.",Pakistan,2018.12

255,EU urged to commit significant increase in climate commitments by 2020,"As the first week of the crucial UN climate summit ended this weekend, businesses, investors, local authorities, trade unions and NGOs on Sunday called upon the European Union to commit to significantly increase the current climate commitments by 2020, in order to secure a successful outcome of the summit.

Stakeholders standing together as the Coalition for Higher Ambition urged the EU governments attending the 24th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as COP24, to respond to the landmark 1.5 degrees Celsius Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report with urgency and also scaled up ambition.

The first week of the talks delivered limited progress on technical issues, but most decisions that are expected from this COP, including a commitment to strengthen all countries' climate pledges by 2020, are left to the ministers, who will be attending the summit this coming week.

To stimulate progress of the talks, the EU needs to do its best to convince all countries to support such a commitment, including by pledging to substantially increase its own climate targets.

With its new draft long-term strategy calling for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, the EU brought new ambition to the negotiating table, but it is the increase of the short-term emission cuts by 2030 that will make or break our response to the climate crisis.

Wendel Trio, Director of Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe, told IANS in a statement: ""The first week of the climate summit was full of bad news on emissions reaching all-time highs and targets not matching the demands of science.""

""It is clear that governments are not keeping the promises they made three years ago when the Paris Agreement was signed. The second week of the COP is the last chance to correct the course.

""We urge EU leaders to show leadership and ambition, and commit to increase the EU's 2030 target even beyond the 55 per cent reduction some member states and the European Parliament are calling for,"" Trio added.

Yann Francoise, Head of climate, energy and circular economy strategies in Paris, said: ""Achieving Paris agreement is already a priority of numerous EU cities. The city of Paris adopted in last March its new Climate Actions Plan to be carbon neutral by 2050 for a fair, inclusive and resilient city.""

""To achieve this ambition, all policies local, regional, national and European should be aligned. The EU should increase its ambition. Thirty years is a short period to achieve this transition which claims social justice initiatives as the same level than mitigation and adaptation solutions. Cities act, have solutions, cities are ready to work together.""

Mir Roca Montserrat, Confederal Secretary of European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC), said: ""Scientists and citizens marching in the streets are reminding us that the climate clock is ticking. The ETUC supports the objective of a net-zero emissions EU in 2050, but reaching that objective requires much more ambitious milestones for 2030 and 2040.""

Achieving net zero emissions by 2050 is a viable target for the overall EU economy and a source of opportunities for value and job creation, added Miguel Angel Munoz, head of climate policies.

Experts say the priority outcome at the COP24, which will conclude on December 14, will be the finalisation of the ""Paris rulebook"", a Bible for transparent implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement -- the first global treaty to reduce emissions by all rich and poor nations.

The COP24 negotiations, which will see participation of more than 20,000 people from nearly 200 countries, are going to be held in the backdrop of grim news on climate change from three UN bodies.

India, one of the participants, has committed itself to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions intensity of gross domestic product (EIGDP) by 33-35 per cent below the 2005 levels by 2030, according to UN

EIGDP is the amount of greenhouse gas emissions created by a unit of GDP.

Indian Minister Harsh Vardhan, who was attending the summit, said the high level of greenhouse gas emission was a major concern and reaffirmed that India would play a ""positive, constructive and balanced role"" in the climate summit.

He said India is working hard for achieving the 175 GW target for installed Renewable Energy capacity by 2022.",India,2018.12
273,Climathon event empowers students to take control of their future,"Students and academics from across Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University have joined forces to participate in the global 24-hour Climathon event with the aim of finding new ways to tackle environmental challenges in Suzhou.

The XJTLU team joined participants from 113 cities in 67 countries around the world who took part in the hackathon-style event, which encouraged ordinary citizens to contribute to sustainable development in their own cities.

Approximately 50 XJTLU students were divided into 12 groups, each tasked with finding the solution to a specific question related to either Human Behaviour and Circular Economy within a 24-hour time period.

In the Circular Economy category, a group who developed the ‘Cleanathon’ – a product capable of filtering out microfibers produced during the laundry process – took out both the first prize and the popularity prize in the category.

The group, which comprised Eva Carocci from the BEng Industrial Design programme, Adit Rastogi from the BA Marketing programme, Xiaoyang Zhou from the BEng Architecture programme and Wenqing Gao from the BSc Financial Mathematics programme, came up with the design to address the issue of unfiltered microfibres polluting the ocean.

“The design of Cleanathon is based on the existing Cora Ball, which can collect and filter one third of the microfibres produced during the laundry process,” said Adit.

“Our goal is to promote Cleanathon to hotels and residential neighbourhoods so that the technology can have a larger market and therefore play an important role in protecting our oceans and our own health.”

Fellow student Eva said she believed the key to the group’s success was teamwork.

“We all come from different departments, and our areas of expertise really complemented each other,” said Eva.

A group who developed an app designed to help XJTLU staff and students exchange and trade unused items was the winning team in the Human Behaviour category.

The group consisted of Naomi Riteco from the MSc Media and Communication programme, Daniel Francis from the MSc Financial Mathematics programme, Xingyan Wang from the BSc Biological Sciences programme and Ziye Xia from the BA Human Resource Management programme.

Dr Barbara Wong, from the Department of Industrial Design, was the team leader and one of the key organisers of the event. She said Climathon required a combination of innovation and insight of the users and environmental problems to find the real problem and an effective solution.

“Climathon participants need a range of different skills – creativity and design thinking, basic prototyping skills, the ability to communicate well and a real sense of team spirit,” said Dr Wong.

“The critical element of the Climathon is that it looks at innovative ideas and business viability, as well as environmental solutions. The groups need to make thorough considerations about the feasibility and business model to guarantee its sustainability.”

The XJTLU students benefited from a range of mentors, who were also the organisers, from the University during the Climathon event, including Dr Ellen Touchstone from the International Business School Suzhou, Dr. Marco Cimillo from the Department of Architecture, Dr Paola Pellegrin from the Department of Urban Planning and Design, and Dr Zheng Feei Ma from the Department of Health and Environmental Sciences.

The event was supported by five departments in XJTLU, including the Department of Industrial Design, Department of Urban Planning and Design, Department of Health and Environmental Sciences, Department of Architecture, and the International Business School Suzhou. Two student clubs – the XJTLU Design Association and Oikos Suzhou – played a key role in the organisation of the event including undertaking promotion activities, recruitment and material preparations.

306,"Total Corbion starts production at its 75,000 tons per year PLA bioplastics plant in Thailand – Plastics Insight","Total Corbion PLA, a 50/50 joint venture between Total and Corbion, has started production of Luminy PLA resins at its 75,000 tons per year PLA (Poly Lactic Acid) bioplastics plant in Rayong, Thailand. Luminy PLA resins contribute to the circular economy.

A wide range of Luminy PLA resins from renewable, non-GMO sugarcane sourced locally will be produced at the new plant, which will include standard PLA to innovative, high heat PLA and PDLA with unique properties. A wide range of markets especially the packaging, consumer goods, 3D printing, fibers and automotive will use these products optimally for extrusion, thermoforming, injection molding and fiber spinning processes.

The production of 75,000 tons per year from the new facility has increased the global production of PLA bioplastics by almost 50%, to 240,000 tons per year. The estimated annual growth rate of PLA market ranges from 10% to 15%.

Stephane Dion, the CEO, Total Corbion PLA, said, “The start-up of this state-of-the-art plant establishes Total Corbion PLA as a world-scale PLA bioplastic producer, ideally located to serve growing markets from Asia Pacific to Europe and the Americas. The subsequent increase in global PLA capacity will enable manufacturers and brand owners to move into the circular economy and produce biobased products with lower carbon footprints and multiple end of life options.”

Bernard Pinatel, President-Refining & Chemicals at Total, commented, “I’m very pleased that the joint venture has started-up the second-largest PLA bioplastics plant in the world. This achievement is fully in line with our strategy, to expand in petrochemicals and, at the same time, innovate in low-carbon solutions. Bioplastics are a great complement to our more traditional petrochemicals products to meet the rising demand for polymers while contributing towards reducing end-of-life concerns.”",India,2018.12
353,Zero-waste economy blooms in the city,"BENGALURU: Garbage produced in thousands of tonnes, overflow the road sides of Bengaluru. The title of ‘Garden City’ is tarnished with the reek of garbage in the air. But in the midst of this stink and doom, a new trend has emerged as a breath of fresh air among the environmentally conscious. Many residents are switching to a zero-waste lifestyle where no trash makes it’s way to landfills. This minimal means of living requires decomposable, eco-friendly substitutes for everyday products. City Express speaks to owners of sustainable companies to understand the trend.

“It is not just about selling products. It is about encouraging an earth-friendly lifestyle,” says Sahar Mansoor, CEO and founder of Bare Necessities. Her company is first in the country to produce high quality, zero waste products such as compostable toothbrushes, lip balms, detergents, reusable straws.

They also provide consultation services to go zero waste for businesses as well as for personal and corporate events. Save Globe India uses raw-materials like bamboo, jute, coconut coir, rice husk, ridge gourd and other sources from nature to manufacture their products.

“We saw how plastic ruins nature, so we began our mission to educate people by conducting campaigns for corporates and apartments, on the availability of natural products that come from nature and go back to nature without costing our planet,” says Harika, co-founder of the company. Celebrations should not become a burden on the planet, says Pooja Dixit. Her company Spill Savers is the first of its kind in the city to rent out reusable cutlery for small events with an aim to reduce the number of disposables going to landfills. Since last year, Boondh – a social enterprise that provides menstrual cup for affordable prices, claims to have reduced 1,68,000 kg of non-biodegradable menstrual waste.

Awareness is the driving force for these startups. “All around Bengaluru, residents have taken the initiative to set up cutlery banks so that there is easier access to renting. We have a WhatsApp group of 13 people from various parts of the city for this cause,” says Dixit. A government enforced ban on plastic disposables compels citizens to switch to alternative, zero waste services. Companies too use such approaches to optimise operations and as a corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy. Save Globe India supplies cloth bags, food containers, and cutlery to major corporates like CCD, TAJ Group of Hotels, Sheraton, ISKON, and WWF.

Lack of automation is a major challenge and results in limited production capacity. Harika explains, “The more automated the production process is, the more the carbon footprint”. The ubiquity of plastic makes it difficult to find alternatives. Not every plastic product can be replaced. For Spill Savers the challenge lies in logistics. “There are two trips while renting, one for the drop and another for the pickup. With Bengaluru traffic and transportation charges, sometimes the transportation cost is more than the rental cost,” explains Dixit.

Expanding the consumer base for zero-waste products will impel corporate giants to enter the market. “At the teething stages of the zero-waste menstruation economy, we hope with similar stakeholders to attempt to reach at least five per cent of India’s menstruating population in the next five years,” says Bharti from Boondh. The enterprises are less product oriented and more driven by social purpose. Mansoor says, “Bare Necessities seeks to change the narrative on waste in India.

In the future, we hope to become a place for policy analysts to work with local government on policy recommendations to manage our waste better, to reduce our waste. A place for behavioural economics, ecologists, researchers and consumers alike to build the ecosystem towards a circular economy.”",India,2018.12
453,"Global construction chemicals, advanced materials market to expand: Deloitte - Xinhua | English.news.cn","New York, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Global market size of construction chemicals and advanced materials (CAMs) would increase to 87 billion U.S. dollars by 2023, up from 57 billion dollars in 2016 thanks to higher demand from smart cities and green buildings, according to a report recently issued by international consulting firm Deloitte.

The growth translates into a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of more than 6 percent. The highest contribution to the incremental growth from 2016 to 2023 will likely come from the Asia and Pacific region, specifically China, India, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia, said the report.

Innovative CAMs, such as pollution-absorbing bricks, light-generating cement, photovoltaic paints and self-healing concrete, are changing not only the way buildings are constructed and retrofitted, but are also expected to help address new challenges of durability in a changing climate.

Construction CAMs have a significant growth opportunity in the coming years, especially as demand from smart cities and green building construction continues to rise, said the report.

Still, construction CAMs now account for only a tiny fraction of the overall construction industry, added the report.

Construction CAMs companies are advised to acquire industry players to fill service gap, collaborate with their customers with an eye on sustainability and circular economy, enhance product portfolios via innovation and restructuring as well as adopt digital technologies to deal with shortage of skilled labor.",China,2019.03

493,Asia’s biggest funding opportunity for sustainable solutions offers up to S$1m and more for clean energy & circular economy solutions,"Singapore—The Liveability Challenge on 10th January launched a global call for innovative clean energy and circular economy solutions for cities in the tropics, dangling Asia’s biggest prize for sustainability solutions with up to S$1 million in project development funds, as well as exclusive crowdfunding campaigns and mentorship opportunities up for grabs. The global call for submissions will close on 5 April 2019, 11:59pm (GMT+8) Singapore time.

The need for transformative action has never been greater. Humanity only has 12 years to curb its carbon emissions and keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius—or risk an irreversible climate crisis, according to the recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

It’s not game over yet. But beating the 12-year climate deadline and providing better lives for Asia’s growing urban populations will take a drastic reduction in our energy footprint and moving to a circular economy. That’s why The Liveability Challenge aims to close the financing gap between the ideas needed for liveable cities of the future, and the investments that will make these solutions a reality.

The Challenge is presented by Temasek Foundation Ecosperity and organised by Eco-Business, in partnership with Ecosperity Week 2019. A total of 28 partners from business, civil society and government are supporting The Liveability Challenge, almost double the number from 2018.

“To give the world a fighting chance at preventing runaway climate change, humanity must slash emissions by 45 per cent and it is clear that incremental improvements will not be enough. But we believe in the power of human ingenuity and determination, which is why this year’s Challenge aims to tackle two major areas of concern in sustainability—energy and circular economy,” said Ms Jessica Cheam, Managing Editor of Eco-Business.

“With more funding and support this year, the Challenge aims to drive impact and ensure a sustainable future for urban residents in the tropical belt, who are among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change in the decades to come,” she added.

The launch event at Cool Cats, The NCO Club at South Beach marked the start of The Liveability Challenge 2019’s call for submissions related to clean energy or the circular economy. Proposals submitted must have proof of concept or have achieved Technology Readiness Level 6. Submissions close 5 April 2019, and must be done via the official website of The Liveability Challenge (www.theliveabilitychallenge.org).

Shortlisted finalists will get to pitch their projects to a panel of Asia’s most sought-after venture capitalists and investors during Ecosperity Week in June. Start-ups, innovators or anyone with an impactful, demonstrable solution will vie for not one but four prizes, including project funds of up to S$1 million from Temasek Foundation Ecosperity, a crowdfunding campaign on private equity investment platform FundedHere, a mentorship opportunity with the Circular Economy Club, and a spot in GoMassive’s accelerator programme.

“The first edition of The Liveability Challenge in 2018 exceeded our expectations by bringing innovators, funders, investors, and the sustainability ecosystem in Singapore and the region closer together. Temasek Foundation Ecosperity played a catalytic role in commercialising the first winning solution, which are the world’s first truly biodegradable straws, as a first step to reduce plastic waste and pollution,” said Mr Lim Hock Chuan, Chief Executive, Temasek Foundation Ecosperity.

He added: “More action is needed as the world seeks to accelerate the transition to a decarbonised and resource-efficient future. Temasek Foundation Ecosperity champions sustainability and liveability. Together with our partners, we hope to get more people on board and help game-changing solutions get the funding and support they need to be commercialised, and in time to come, make a big, positive difference to our collective living environment.”

Representatives from business, civic society and government at the exclusive launch event heard from a high-level line-up of speakers including venture capitalists, investors, sustainability experts and two of Singapore’s most prolific start-ups. They spoke about what it takes for innovative cleantech start-ups to get funded, how climate change is driving transformation in the economy, and why Singapore is the perfect bridge between sustainable solutions and green finance.

509,Focus on circular economy for job creation and climate change goals,"The Global Recycling Day, which falls on March 18, has a crucial significance for a country like India, which has to achieve massive economic growth by balancing the dual objectives of job creation and its international commitment to the Paris Climate Goals and SDGs (sustainable development goals).

In such a scenario a transition is imminent, a kind of paradigm shift that is focused on fostering economic growth, through circular economy, banking on the so called 6R principles of 'reduce-recover-reuse-recycle-redesign-remanufacture'.

India's rapid economic growth, has created a larger consumer base with a growing demand for materials. As India embarks on even higher trajectories of growth, its resource requirements is set to increase. Estimates suggest that annual material consumption in India will likely triple by 2030, compared to 4.83 billion MT in 2009. Enhanced material recycling could help India decouple its growth story from primary resource and material consumption.

If one thinks of long term growth a circular economy path to development is something we should consider as it could bring India economic benefits of around Rs 40 lakh crore in 2050 compared to the so called business-as-usual development path – a benefit equivalent to 30 per cent of India's current GDP.

Take job creation for instance. The more labour intensive recycling value chain can generate six to eight times more jobs than by incineration or land filling of wastes –Examples of this can be cited from the United States scrap industry which generated over 150,000 direct jobs and 323,000 indirect jobs in 2015 (ISRI); and China where recycling industry created 1.5 million direct jobs and about 10 million indirect jobs.

In India, the metal recycling sector presently employs almost 1.75 million people, contributing 2% of the GDP. Studies reveal that material recycling in all probability can create six times more jobs in 2030. This calls for designating recycling as a ‘strategic sector’ under the Make in India programme in view of the sector’s huge environmental footprint, tremendous job creation potential and, its prospects of adopting high-end process and technologies.

However, recycling rates in India are languishing for a variety of factors, making the country the third largest importer of various types of scrap material.

Although presently there is an over-supply of scrap metal in South-East Asia, imposition of import duty on metal scraps is a deterrent for recyclers to import. In recent years, there has been a rising cost of imports from Free Trade Agreement (FTA) countries too since suppliers increase their product pricing in order to keep parity with the duty added price of scrap from non-FTA countries.

To mitigate such risks, there is an inherent need to ensure a steady supply of domestic scrap conforming to appropriate quality standards. Government should also look at incentivising R&D and innovation in the sector since the unavailability of indigenous technologies and domestic suppliers leave no option for the players but to rely on high-cost import of machineries.

Similarly, a focus on 'emerging technologies' would be absolutely critical to radically transform the recycling industry in the future and make it globally competitive. For example, blockchain records transactional data throughout the recycling supply chain thereby helping ensure traceability of material flow from collectors to recyclers.

Such technologies combined with artificial intelligence could fundamentally change the way in which materials and natural resources are accounted for, valued and traded, incentivising individuals, companies and governments to unlock financial value from the so-called waste materials.

Considering the tremendous potential for reuse and recycling of products in India, there is a need for a more comprehensive national policy aiming at formalisation of the ecosystem and 'ease of doing business' for recyclers.

The policy may target at removing barriers for the input factors, establishing an electronic market-place for trading of scraps and recycled products, promoting public procurement of recycled material, harmonising the standards for scraps (ISRI and BIS standards) and establishing accredited testing labs and certification procedure. Following successful examples in China, government should look at setting up dedicated material recycling zones (MRZ), connected with large industrial areas and cities through reverse-logistics network.

Of late, the global community has started to recognize the long-term impact a circular economy could have towards climate change mitigation. Unfortunately, in India, as in many other developing countries, there has been little emphasis on 'circular economy' as an important pillar of NDC (Nationally Determined Contributions) for achieving low-carbon growth with social equity and inclusiveness. The reduce-reuse-recycle of wastes significantly reduces energy consumption in the commodity value chain.

For example, 17 trees, 2.5 barrels of oil, 4100 kWh of electricity, 4 cum of landfill and 31780 litres of water can be conserved by recycling 1 tonne of paper alone. In the same manner, recycling an aluminum can or producing a glass container eliminates 95% and 70% of energy required for producing a similar container from virgin material. To embed the topic in our national climate change narrative, there should be deeper empirical research on GHG impacts of potential circular economy actions across various sectors.

Policy, institution and technology are necessary but are not sufficient conditions by themselves to create a break-through in material recycling. As global examples and best-practices show, a 'circular economy' should be a core and embedded theme of the government’s key missions and programmes.

A fourth pillar is to bring in a behavioural change where every citizen naturally and intuitively segregates waste at the source. For this, the government and businesses alike should learn from successful zero waste systems implemented elsewhere in the world, mostly in EU, China, South Korea, where almost all construction and demolition wastes, paper, plastic, glass, metals etc., are typically recycled.

In India’s case, making it an integral part of Swachha Bharat, Smart City Mission, Make-in-India Mission etc., will be a crucial step to mainstream the circular economy and accelerate its adoption in all walks of life.

551,Spotlight: Circular economy key to addressing urban waste crisis - Xinhua | English.news.cn,"NAIROBI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The fast growing cities in the Global South are grappling with waste crisis thanks to limited infrastructure and technical knowhow to promote recycling.

In many instances, urban centers in the developing world rely on landfills to dispose tonnes of waste generated by households and industries.

The growing waste crisis in less developed countries has been linked to the dominance of the linear economy where producers convert natural resources to products which consumers later dispose of in an environmentally unsustainable manner.

Nevertheless, policy makers and experts have identified circular economy as a long term solution to the growing urban waste crisis.

Siim Kiisler, president of the fourth session of the UN Environment Assembly and Estonia's minister for environment, said during the opening plenary that currently some two billion people worldwide lack access to solid waste collection services.

He observed that about 64 million people are directly affected by uncontrolled dumping and open burning at dumpsites.

In order to tackle the rising waste management crisis, Kiisler called upon UN member states to define national targets for reducing waste generation, increase reuse of products and recycling of waste and significantly reducing single-use plastic products by 2030.

The UN Environment Assembly which runs from March 11 to 15 brought together more than 4,000 delegates from 170 countries and regions to explore new strategies to promote environmental sustainability.

The youth have been at the frontline of adopting low cost technologies to establish waste recycling enterprises.

Experts said the circular economy is akin to a green economy because it promotes recycling of resources in a bid to reduce pressure on the earth's finite resources.

Jacob Hagberg, scientific advisor at Sweden Ministry of Environment and Energy, emphasized the need for the global community to invest in technologies to promote recycling of waste.

""The more waste that is used as raw materials for production of new products the better it is for environmental conservation efforts,"" said Hagberg.

The huge upfront cost of technology for recycling has been identified as a barrier to the transition to a circular economy. There are also technical challenges that have hindered the circular economy from gaining traction in low income economies.

Political influence from those benefiting from linear economy has also contributed to slow uptake of recycling.

However, sustainable transition to a circular economy will require a redesign of products to ensure that they are developed in a way that makes it easy for them to be recycled in future.

Most developing cities have a thriving informal recycling industry where plastics are collected and reused for the manufacture of consumer products.

However, these recycling efforts need to be scaled up as they are important sources of jobs for the youth.

Hagberg noted that recycling of waste is good for the environment. It also provides a source of sustainable jobs for millions of unemployed youth in big cities.

Kenyan manufacturers in the plastics value chain have formed a company to coordinate the recycling of plastic bottles.

Local plastic industry recycling firm PETCO has realized that the only way to create a sustainable recycling industry is to incorporate recycled material into locally made products.

Joyce Gachugi, country manager of PETCO Kenya, said that support for local industries to engage in plastic recycling will boost growth of the circular economy in the country.",China,2019.03
640,CARBIOS breakthrough technology enables production of PET Bottles from 100% recycled plastic waste – Plastics Insight,"CARBIOS has announced to have successfully accomplished the production of first PET-bottles made with 100% Purified Terephthalic Acid (rPTA). The company did it through the enzymatic biorecycling of plastic waste. The achievement of this remarkable milestone is groundbreaking and confirms the potential of the company’s technology to engage the whole industry in a responsible transition towards a circular economy.

Alain Marty, Chief Scientific Officer at CARBIOS, explains, “We have successfully developed the first biological process with which all kinds of PET plastic waste can be broken down into its original components and reused to produce virgin plastic products for applications such as PET-bottles. This new step shows the strong potential of CARBIOS’ enzymatic technology and provides a breakthrough solution to help solve society’s growing waste problem.”

Carbios’ proprietary biorecycling technology is based on the use of bioengineered enzymes and has the ability to turn PET plastic waste back into its original components at a rate of 97% in only 16 hours. Carbios also demonstrated that virgin PET can be made with 100% rPTA via its proprietary biorecycling process. However, this process makes use of all kinds of post-consumer PET plastic bottles which are clear, colored, opaque and complex. This latest technology is seen as a potential game-changer in the transition towards a circular economy. This is likely to benefit the environment and future generations.

PET is the most common polyester in the market these days. It’s widely used in the production of plastic packaging, textile fibers and more than 500 billion units of plastic bottles are produced every year. Going with the current market scenario and expectations, the market is likely to grow at 4.8% annually from 2017 to 2025. The Carbios’ technology offers environment-friendly and efficient solutions which are capable of bringing about a change in the way we produce some of the most commonly used plastic products.

Jean-Claude Lumaret, CEO of CARBIOS, commented, “The plastics industry faces fundamental challenges related to sustainability. Our technology, based on a circular model, reuses resources rather than consuming them. This new milestone takes us one step closer to bringing our technology to the market. With the construction of our demonstration plant to start later this year, we’re aiming to engage the whole plastics industry in a transition towards a circular economy and take a leadership role as a global license provider for the biorecycling of PET plastics and fibers.”",India,2019.03
652,News Updates - The research findings of how to globalize the circular economy was published in Nature,"During the process of global economic development, problems such as inefficient use of resources, serious pollution of waste, uncontrolled emission of greenhouse gas, and excessive wastewater are emerging. Global demand for resource is projected to be doubled by 2050. Unreasonable resource exploitation and utilization is restricting economic development. Thus, sustainable resource management has become one inevitable choice for industrial development. Circular economy has been practiced in many countries and regions, such as China, US, EU, Japan and Korea. Nevertheless, circular-economy projects and relevant policies in different countries were developed based on their own situations without global consideration. The transnational circular-economy cooperation mechanism has not been established, resulting in a low level of circular economy development, for example the global recycling rate of industrial materials is only 6%. The rapid development of global economic integration and international trade requires that circular economy should break through geographical boundaries with close global cooperation. Therefore, to advance the globalization of circular economy, governments need to carry out international cooperation urgently through a systematic revolution of global industry system.Prof. Geng Yong from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Prof. Joseph Sarkis from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and Prof. Raimund Bleischwitz from University College London proposed policy recommendations on globalizing the circular economy based on the preliminary work. Their article “Globalize the circular economy” was published in the top journal Nature on 10th, Jan, 2019, which is the frontier study focusing on circular economy globalization by Chinese scholars. See the full paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00017-z.

This study points out that with the increasing use of sustainable materials, new markets and innovative business models, most circular-economy initiatives at the national level have helped reduce the materials, waste, energy and emissions. For example, some industries, such as the aluminum sector, are starting to monitor material flows globally to improve resource efficiency. Nonetheless, many fragmented circular-economy initiatives and networks still exist and are inefficient. Accurate, traceable and reliable data on the flows and stocks of most materials, and on the costs and efficiencies of industrial process, are lacking. Unfortunately, no international policy efforts integrate circular-economy approaches, leading to less benefits. Thus, it is urgent to implement innovative circular economy initiatives and prepare more appropriate policies.

In order to address these concerns, this study raised several strategies to globalize the circular economy, such as: (1) A global database should be set up to capture links between resource uses, including indicators on material, water and energy flows. (2) A global platform should be established for sharing knowledge on the circular economy. (3) International alliances should be created to promote large-scale experimentation. (4) Standards for performance measurement, reporting, accounting and future products need to be developed and implemented. (5) Policymakers should work together to prepare more appropriate regulations and enhance effective enforcement, resolve potential disputes at a global scale. The findings of this study provide valuable insights to promote the circular economy globalization and formulate international principles of sustainable resource management.

660,Could a digital barcode on consumer products enable the circular economy?,"One of the main reasons why global recycling rates are so low—just 20 per cent of the world’s plastic is recycled—is because people simply do not know how to recycle.

Too often, people throw non-recyclable stuff in with recyclables, unaware that this derails the whole process. Waste that has not been separated arrives at recycling plants and recyclers struggle to sort out what they can use from what they can’t.

But what if there was a system that made it easy to distinguish recyclables from non-recyclables? What if the lifecycle of every consumer product could be tracked, from factory to recycling plant?

This is now possible because products can be connected to the internet. And if a London-headquartered software startup called EVRYTHNG gets its way, pretty soon every product made and sold will carry a new type of barcode.

On that barcode is a unique web address for the product. When a consumer or recycler scans the barcode using a smartphone, they can get all sorts of information on the product from the web identity that is stored in the cloud, from where it was made and who made it, to the materials it is made from, and how to recycle it—a sort of LinkedIn profile page for consumer goods.

Knowing the origins of packaged products is crucial to tackling the plastic pollution crisis, says Niall Murphy, the founder and chief executive of EVRYTHNG, which counts fizzy drinks brand Coca-Cola and packaging giant WestRock as customers, and has offices in London, San Francisco, New York, Zurich and Singapore.

To respond to the plastic crisis, plastic producers “either have to provide organic based packaging, which composts itself, or have innovate so that packaging can become returnable—and that means that it has to be traceable,” Murphy says.

In this interview with Eco-Business, the tech entrepreneur talks about why companies should care about the traceability of their products, why digital labelling will take off in Asia, and the impact EVRYTHNG could have on the circular economy.

In a nutshell, how does EVRYTHNG work?

There are 4 trillion consumer products made and consumed every year. EVRYTHNG works with consumer product makers to put a tag on every physical product, from a can of Coke to a t-shirt.

The system works in three stages:

1. The consumer scans shopping receipts to import purchased products into a mobile app.

2. Through the mobile app, consumers can access information on where, when and how to recycle the different parts of each product based on local available infrastructure.

3. Consumers can then recycle items in street bins or preferred recycling centres. They can earn rewards by registering where they are recycling by scanning or tapping identity tags on recycling units.

Rewarding the consumer for recycling is really important, and they can post their recycling activity in social media. The programme also provides product information on what is being recycled back to the recycling firm.

How has EVRYTHNG been deployed so far?

The first app was launched at Carrefour supermarkets in Spain is called Reciclaya. It allows customers to determine how to recycle products by simply scanning the barcode on their supermarket receipt. More specifically, the app separates products into virtual recycling bins so that customers can place them in the nearest appropriate containers.

How will your technology have an impact in Asia?

It will for two reasons. First, because there’s a huge amount of supply chain production that comes from China and Southeast Asia. Second, because engagement between smartphone users and the physical world is higher in Asia than anywhere in the world. Last year, US$1.5 trillion was transacted in mobile payments through WeChat, for example.

When companies look at where they can make the most impact [in reducing their environmental footprint] it is Asia. Corporates are faced with significant challenges in their global supply chains, for instance, the counterfeiting of high value consumer goods, and a lot of those problems come from Asian markets. Transparency over the provenance of products can help address those issues.

Not everyone, particularly in developing markets, has a smartphone to scan a product for product or recycling info. How will you get around this reality?

Yes, this is of course a practical issue. But there are other ways of getting the information to consumers through scanners in stores—for instance, holding a product in front of a screen to get information about it.

To what extent do you think that consumers will care where products come from, particularly in Asia where sustainability is not as big an issue as in Europe?

Consumers may care less about the sustainability of a product in Asia, but they do care about authenticity and wellbeing. Global brands have liability in Europe and the US for practices they deploy in emerging markets. So part of this is consumer demand, but the other aspects are business accountability demands and taxation on landfill.

How do you ensure that the digital links can’t be forged and that the information given is genuine and accurate?

The unique identities provided for individual products are crypto-secure credentials. But obviously a QR code can be photocopied and therefore replicated. By being connected to a digital identity on the web we can detect duplications rapidly and therefore flag all products associated with that identity as suspect.

How long will it take before every consumer product has these digital links, and what do you see as the obstacles in the way of that happening?

Realistically it’s going to take two to three years for roll-out. Barriers include investment by packaging companies in digitally serialised printing for packaging, and upgrades to point of sale software by retailers.

Just as the technology behind blockchain uses an enormous amount of energy, have you looked into the energy footprint of the system for powering technology?

EVRYTHNG uses real-time analytics technologies in the cloud that are significantly more cost effective than Blockchain by several orders of magnitude. The reason Blockchain is so energy consuming is the huge amount of effort that goes in to mining and replicating transactions, neither of which are factors in realtime analytics systems like ours.

However, there is clearly energy consumed to manage data digitally about product items. What’s needed is a full cost analysis taking into consideration savings in materials, transport and waste. That kind of analysis across the full physically and digital lifecycle of a product has not been done, but I think would be very valuable.",Singapore,2019.03
661,Circular economy makes waves in Asia,"CONSUMER preference is becoming a key driver of business adoption of sustainable strategies and practices.

Research released by YouGov last year showed that 50 per cent of people in the Asia-Pacific region believe that businesses have the responsibility to ensure that their supply chains do not harm the environment.

This figure further increased in Singapore to 56 per cent and 63 per cent in the Philippines, with Jen Teo, executive director of the Singapore Environment Council highlighting that millennials were the drivers in spending more on sustainable goods. ""Companies that embrace sustainable and ethical practices will do better in the long run as more Singaporeans choose their products and services over those of their competitors.""

It is clear that market signals like these that are driving increasing interest and commitment to sustainable sourcing and manufacturing practices by business.

For much of the last 100 years, the mainstay of business growth has been the linear ""take-make-waste"" economic model which paid little attention to the long-term outcomes for the environment. Today, companies at the cutting edge are embracing the circular economy - an economic model that designs out waste and pollution, keeps products and materials in use for as long as possible and recovers what is considered waste, using it as a resource for production.

Currently, more than 90 per cent of used materials are discarded rather than cycled back into the economy. Put simply, this means valuable resources are literally going to waste. The circular economy makes better use of our planet's limited resources and is estimated to have the potential to generate US$4.5 trillion of additional economic output by 2030.

Pioneering the transition to the circular economy presents companies with new and diverse opportunities for growth. The ""Waves of Change"" collaboration between high-performance surfboard maker, Starboard, and DSM, a purpose-led global science-based company, is a novel example.

The premise of DSM's business strategy lends itself to creating value for all stakeholders across People, Planet and Profit, and ensuring all business groups and solutions ladder up to its commitment to contribute further to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

The Waves of Change initiative addresses both strategy objectives and involves collecting and recycling nearly 2,000 tonnes of discarded fishing nets, also known as ""ghost gear"" from the sea each year. A supply chain located around the coast of India engages around 300 people in various activities such as collection of fish nets, cleaning, handling, cutting, washing and packing before the material is compounded at DSM's plant in Pune. The result is a unique, repurposed resin containing recycled polyamide 6 at a maximum of 70 per cent of the composition which is reinforced with fibre glass to make key surfboard components.

Importantly, the upcycled material is cost competitive and outperforms newly-manufactured plastic. Response from surfer communities has been immediate and positive, encouraging Starboard to have all plastic components in the surfboards made with the same material.

'NOTHING IS WASTE UNTIL IT'S WASTED'

In a study by consulting firm Bain & Co involving 297 global firms released earlier this year, 81 per cent said sustainability is more important to their business today than it was five years ago. Experts said this global trend of companies making sustainability a bigger part of their business is also reflected in Singapore.

More opportunities for circular innovation are also emerging at home. Speaking at the St Gallen Symposium 2019 Singapore Forum, Temasek Holdings CEO Ho Ching stated that businesses must fulfil their obligation to ensure a liveable and sustainable planet besides pursuing financial returns.

Panellists at the CleanEnviro Summit Singapore 2018 engaged in conversation around market opportunities for businesses that dare to be creative and exploit high-tech developments to create smart waste collection systems, a gap as yet unfilled in Singapore and cities across Southeast Asia.

The Singapore government is also behind sustained efforts to encourage research and development in this area. In 2017, the National Environment Agency (NEA) announced its Closing the Waste Loop Initiative, a programme that funds collaborations between industry and research institutes to develop waste management solutions, including recovering value from waste streams like plastics, food and electrical products. More recently, Masagos Zulkifli, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, has laid renewed emphasis on Singapore's Zero Waste Nation campaign, declaring: 'Nothing is waste until it's wasted.'

The policy framework is also supportive, with the Singapore government behind sustained efforts to encourage research and development in this area.

With the strength of government support and increasing consumer expectations, first-movers in Singapore are well placed to capitalise on the commercial advantages of embracing circular supply chains. It is an opportunity not to be missed.

737,'Say yes to less waste',"THIS WEEK'S TOPIC: How may the private sector do its part to reduce plastic/other pollution in the oceans? What incentives or other measures could help in combating the problem?

BUSINESS must make more visible and continuous efforts to develop the circular economy. Employees should be rewarded for showing how they can contribute to this.

Examples of business extravagance include failing to make use of cloud storage, insisting on paper when virtual will do and misunderstanding the uses and potential of passwords to facilitate the digitisation of communications and systems. A heavy tax on plastic and paper would make the problems of pollution and waste clear to users. Businesses should be responsible for running weekend clean-up parties and modestly rewarding their employees to recover plastic waste on land and sea. ""What you do is the example you set.""

REDUCING pollution and waste is everyone's responsibility. It starts with businesses redesigning products and minimising packaging so that they are recyclable. Consumers need to make informed choices about what they buy. Each household needs to embrace recycling. These actions are underpinned by all municipalities having rubbish collection, recycling capabilities and waste disposal processes in place to prevent plastics ending up in rivers and flowing into our oceans.

Tax incentives to encourage research in recyclable products and packaging and financing for infrastructure projects for waste collection, recycling and disposal would help. Our survival and that of future generations is at stake.

AT Henkel, we believe that solving the plastic issue is a joint responsibility. That's why we are actively engaged in several partnerships aiming to drive progress towards a circular economy. They include our participation in the New Plastics Economy initiative, cooperation with Plastic Bank and founding membership in the Alliance to End Plastic Waste. We've also set ourselves ambitious targets for sustainable packaging. For example, by 2025, 100 per cent of Henkel's packaging will be recyclable, reusable or compostable.

Globally, we train our employees as Sustainability Ambassadors and engage them to drive sustainability along the entire value chain. In Singapore, our employees have participated in marine debris sample collection and various coastal and waterways cleanup efforts. This year, we will also rally our employees to participate in Henkel's global coastal waste collection initiative. By joining forces, we can make an impact and protect our environment.

TO address the issue of plastic pollution, a sustained, concerted and decisive effort among industry players, government agencies and the community is required. At NTUC FairPrice, sustainability is one of four pillars under our overall CSR commitments.

Amongst other things, we continue to take affirmative actions to reduce plastic bag use through a comprehensive framework that encompasses the efforts of like-minded partners, while also incorporating sustainability initiatives that take into consideration consumer needs and practices of our operations. We encourage the community to join us and be responsible by taking a first step to use less plastic bags so that we may collectively create a more sustainable environment.

THERE is a moral obligation for the private sector to conduct business responsibly, above anything else. All stakeholders must continue to work on developing alternative substrates to plastic, design and implement return and reuse systems, and focus at the same time on cleaning up polluted waterways and oceans.

However, the stick may work just as effectively as the carrot, so a robust regulatory framework and the imposition of stiff penalties are also required to drive necessary change in lifestyle and habits.

THE private sector can do its part to reduce pollution by minimising the amount of plastic generated at source, increasing the collection of plastics and reducing post-collection leakages. At PwC, we manage our own environmental impact and beyond through reducing our own use of plastics as well as participating in volunteering efforts to clean our beaches.

Forward-looking companies have started integrating circular economy principles into their operations like re-designing products and using new materials that facilitate end-of-life recycling. Measures such as extended producer responsibility (EPR) systems, advanced disposal levies to product bans and dumping fines can also help combat pollution.

THE majority of industrial processes produce wastewater that contaminates oceans/surface water and increases landfill wastes, upending the delicate balance of marine ecosystems and irreversibly damaging water bodies. Business leaders can champion conservation efforts in their own fields through the adoption of innovative wastewater treatment technologies, creating a circular economy where usable resources are extracted from wastewater and reinvested into industrial processes.

This vastly reduces not only the environmental footprint but also decreases operating costs in the long run. Challenges to implementation involve high upfront investment, which can be mitigated by not only technological innovation but also by a creative business model (such as one in which the water treatment company owns, operates, and maintains the infrastructure).

THERE are a multitude of ways the advertising industry can help and raising awareness by visualisation is one of the most powerful means. GREY Malaysia's Unforgettable Bag' a Cannes Lions Award-winning campaign for Tesco (which encouraged customers to embrace reusable bags) not only raised awareness globally but contributed to behavioural change. The same with the agency's ""Plastic Diet"" campaign for WWF, which drew worldwide media attention to the volume of plastic people inadvertently consume.

Even at a local level one can take meaningful action, GREY Singapore staff recently volunteered to do a Changi Beach clean-up. This helps to protect the environment as well as give back to the community.

At a global level, one can take WPP as an example. It recently took the word ""plastic"" out of its name - Wire & Plastic Products - and has committed to phasing out single-use plastics in all of its 3,000-plus agency offices and campuses worldwide by 2020. It has also signed the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment and pledged to work with clients and partners to drive change.

The advertising world can lead when it comes to championing waste-free living. It has the commitment, and the communications expertise to help make plastic pollution a priority for people. By collaborating at scale, it can make an even more discernible difference.

TACKLING the issue of plastic pollution needs immediate and urgent attention, and the public and private sectors need to work together to achieve this goal. While governments are laying the important groundwork and taking affirmative actions through policy-making and public awareness campaigns, the private sector can contribute technology expertise and innovative solutions to help build a resource-efficient future.

An example is IGES' patented and commercially-proven technology that converts end-of-life plastics destined for landfill into road-ready fuels that require no further processing, blending or refining. This technology offers a sustainable solution to reduce plastic pollution and deliver lasting positive impact to governments and local communities to create a cleaner planet for the next generation.

ACCORDING to the National Environment Agency, in 2017 only 6 per cent of the 815,200 tonnes of plastic waste generated was recycled. The issue of waste management and reduction, but also recycling and recovery, are major challenges for all humanity in terms of both resources and the environment.

By leveraging data collection and analysis, the waste industry can help to reduce these challenges through better management decision making. Real-time logistics flow management with better adapted collection routes, waste recovery where waste becomes secondary raw material for industrials, transfer of non-recyclable common waste to incineration plants to produce energy or to storage centres that capture the biogas produced by the fermentation of organic waste are a few methods.

In the waste management sector, data-driven strategy is certainly in its early stages; however, there are certainly opportunities to use data to improve planning, efficiency levels and recycling efforts.

PLASTICS are efficient materials that can save resources and offer convenience for society. They become a problem when they are not managed or disposed properly and end up in the environment. As one of the world's leading chemical companies, BASF is engaged in reinforcing responsible handling of plastics, including promotion of solutions contributing to a circular economy.

The global Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW), an alliance of some 30 companies including BASF, will drive solutions to solve the world's plastic waste problem. The alliance will work with governments, academia, non-government organisations and civil society to invest in joint projects to eliminate plastic waste from the environment.

THE greatest hope is in educating our youth on the environmental impact of every decision they make. This is where the private sector can contribute, by working together with schools and youth groups on programmes that will raise awareness of pollution and other environmental issues.

The children of today will play a significant role in shaping the future we want. From a young age, children can form lifelong habits to reduce the use of plastics and carry reusable food containers and water bottles. Children can also take away what they learn to influence their family members to recycle and dispose of waste in responsible ways.

WE can make the most meaningful difference with the greatest positive impact on the planet and its people - if corporations leverage on their global scale. At Mondelez International, we reduce our environmental impact by using less energy, water and waste, and commit globally to make all packaging recyclable by 2025, all paper-based packaging sourced sustainably by 2020, and minimising our overall food waste.

As of this year, we are proud to have removed 65 million kilogram of packaging material, as one of the many steps towards leading the future of snacking sustainably.

FOR starters, the dozens of private sector events held each week can adopt environmentally friendly steps as prescribed by the Sustainable Singapore Movement.

We did just that at the inaugural RHT Rajan Menon Foundation GAIL Sustainability Day last week. Participants at the sustainability forum, held at green event space Sentosa Golf Club, were encouraged to return their lanyards and plastic ID cases at the end of the event for re-use. This is a small step in the right direction.

The government could consider giving private companies tax breaks to conduct sustainability audits to review their operations, find ways to improve and adopt the right practices to reduce waste and use resources more efficiently.

POLLUTION can be caused by overproduction as well as lack of controls and policing at the government level. There are no easy solutions for the challenge posed by plastic pollution. However, emerging technologies, such as AI, can help the private sector do its part. Advanced Analytics can be leveraged along the supply chain to reduce wastage - by accurately predicting consumption, we can avoid overproduction.

Similarly, AI algorithms can help climate scientists understand natural systems and forecast patterns, helping to identify effective interventions, as well as facilitating enhanced coordination among researchers to share and analyse key data on pollution. Data analytics could also contribute to tackling marine pollution by using satellite imaging to locate and track ocean trash. Using analytics in this way, the private sector can gain a business advantage to sell to environment-conscious consumers.

TO put things right in our oceans, we need to rethink entire industries. Organisations need to look in-depth at every aspect of how they operate, from product innovation to waste management, from third-party suppliers to ownership models.

As a wealth manager, Lombard Odier believes that companies with sustainable business practices, financial models and business models will drive excess investment returns, and this is what we convey to our clients. Demand is perhaps the strongest force for change. At a time when investors demand sustainable investment products, and the security of supply and cost of raw materials are weighing on industrial companies' results and prospects, we believe it is intuitive for businesses to consider the lasting consequences of their actions, including rethinking ways to reduce waste and manage pollution.

MANY in Singapore may say, ""We do not dump our plastic waste. We change our trash to ash."" True. But is it sustainable without legions of foreign workers? Or ample landfills for the ash? We need to tackle the root cause of reducing plastic waste at source. Companies that use plastics have a pivotal role to play. They can help nudge consumers from a throwaway culture by removing single-use plastics.

Promoting recycling is another avenue. Our plastic waste recycling rate is only 4 per cent. Compared to the 20 per cent world average, we have a long way to go. Reducing packaging waste is yet another area. The Singapore Packaging Agreement initiative for companies to reduce such waste is a good, albeit, voluntary move. Ultimately, long lasting change is driven by legislation and good policy intervention.

Targets need to be set for companies to reach in their use and disposal of plastics. To spur innovation in reducing, recycling and disposing plastic waste, the government should also sponsor research through grants from the National Research Foundation. Hopefully then, we will become a shining example of a ""zero waste"" nation.

WITH the spotlight on growing environmental concerns around plastic waste, corporations are paying more attention as industry and consumers demand environmentally friendly products. At Dell Technologies, our entrepreneurial spirit drives us to innovate and advance sustainability initiatives, and we intercept ocean-bound plastics to repurpose them, collaborating with many other organisations to scale up the adoption of best practices in preventing plastics from reaching our oceans.

One way to combat the problem is to apply a creative focus on sustainability for products and services. For instance, the concept of a circular economy drives much of our sourcing and design, and we strive to use, and reuse, materials responsibly, with 94 per cent of weight of packaging made from renewable or recyclable materials. Besides pioneering the use of recycled content, we also developed new processes with our suppliers to close the recycling loop on various materials, such as creating ink from diesel emissions in India.

We're huge advocates for the circular economy model and believe that harnessing technology can help drive positive environmental changes, and eventually, human progress.

ThE private sector needs to support the acceleration of corporate stewardship. As one of the fastest-growing hospitality companies in the Asia-Pacific, Hilton is committed through our Travel with Purpose Strategy, which aims to uphold our responsibility to the environment to ensure sustainable travel and tourism for the next generation.

In accelerating corporate stewardship, we have encouraged our team members to be part of the solution. With their support, Hilton has banned plastic straws and eliminated plastic water bottles from our meetings and events. Together, we are piloting plastic alternatives with suppliers and partnering on campaigns such as NEA's ""Say Yes to Less Waste"" to build awareness.

THE private sector has made strides in embracing the economic model of a circular economy that designs out waste and pollution, keeps materials in use for as long as possible and recovers waste, using it as a resource for production.

Given that the ocean makes up 71 per cent of Earth's surface, no one can solve the problem of plastic pollution alone. Private firms can do their part to fuel global change through the phasing out of or stricter regulation of plastic products.

There should also be more effort put towards recovering waste products through innovative sustainable solutions, whether through strategic partnerships or the uptake of technology. There is significant financial opportunity in the downstream of a circular economy, and this is where the business motivator lies.

BUSINESSES today have an important role in reducing carbon footprint. As good corporate citizens, we should work with all the stakeholders to drive change and set targets beyond the minimum requirements. At KONE, we strive to be a global leader in sustainability. One way is through increasing energy and resource efficiency as we envision making sustainable offerings a reality.

Our innovation efforts are focused in contributing to the circular economy and delivering solutions that urban populations truly need. We work closely with our suppliers in selecting materials that are environmentally friendly and recyclable to develop products with long lifetime and modularity.

TODAY'S consumers are increasingly placing importance on a brand's sustainability practices in their purchasing decisions. However, more needs to be done to bring awareness of the risks of ocean pollution into the heart of public consciousness. Here at Dentsu Aegis Network, Dentsu Singapore and

Green is the New Black launched a Plastic Salt campaign using miniature 3D printed salt grinders, to bring to light how microplastic pollution is not just in our oceans but has made its way into our lives, and into the food we eat. Alongside the plastic salt video for World Earth Day, we are also educating young people in Singapore on the impact of plastic pollution in our school outreach programme The Code. We are reaching 400 students and donating 500 hours back to schools in Singapore in July as part of this programme.

Businesses should recognise their responsibility as industry leaders and actively champion for solutions to mitigate their environment impact across all levels. Whether it is in adopting conscious waste management practices internally, or collaborating with customers and industry partners to build a waste-free future.

At Sealed Air, we are in business to protect and to solve critical packaging challenges, and to leave our world better than we found it. Sustainability needs to be part of a business' commitment. For instance, Sealed Air has pledged to deliver 100 per cent recyclable or reusable packaging offerings, and 50 per cent average recycled content across all solutions by 2025. We urge businesses to collaborate for change and focus on collective action to influence and drive positive environmental impact across the value chain.

AS a global thought leader in Green IT, Basis Bay believes a balanced world is possible where the welfare of people and care for our planet is central to the way we think and act.

With sustainability in mind, Basis Bay has developed a holistic approach to Green IT as a corporate philosophy engaging all stakeholders. This comprehensive framework includes enabling IT solutions that ensures efficiency and caring for an organisation throughout their lifecycles in a way that assures resources are utilised and appreciated with minimum wastage and impact to the environment.

Our solutions in themselves have been green for decades and we make it a commitment to constantly look for the best ways to provide sustainable IT solutions from designing, sourcing, and usage.

Organisations should be incentivised and encouraged to procure services and products from organisations ""like ours"" that have green offerings or truly adopt green practices. Keep in mind such offerings will eventually (if not already) cost less to procure as we create an efficient sustainable business ecosystem that is kinder to the environment.

BUSINESSES should proactively find ways to minimise the environmental impact at every part of their operation, especially around non-essential plastic packaging and single-use plastics, which can significantly reduce the volume of plastic waste that might end up in the oceans.

Reducing plastic pollution effectively requires solutions that are both supply and demand-led - curbing the reliance on plastics while encouraging consumers to explore more environmentally-friendly options. In Singapore, these efforts have been largely led by the private sector. To drive a more powerful shift in mindset and behaviour, the government can consider introducing a tax or a gradually-increasing cap on the use of plastics.

In addition, they can also incentivise businesses to adopt technological solutions and reward organisational efforts towards a non-plastic and environmentally sustainable future.

CONSUMERS today are overly dependent on plastics for their convenience. That it fits nicely with the prevalent throwaway mentality appeals to many. It will take a long time to change this over-dependency.

Businesses can do more to change this ingrained habit and tackle this plastic scourge by recycling more and using more bio-degenerating matters. Tackling this problem at source is not only vital but urgent to rein in the problem of marine debris, particularly plastic pollution in the oceans.

The criticality of the problem warrants both incentives and dis-incentives. The government may now want to consider imposing a plastics tax. Both businesses and consumers should be taxed for the use of plastics. However, on the flip side, when businesses and consumers recycle, tax credits can be given to offset the tax.

In the meantime, government, businesses and civic groups should continue collaboratively to intensify public education to create greater awareness of the looming plastic scourge, to reduce the use of plastics and to promote recycling.

IT'S mainly about encouraging businesses to innovate in their supply chain. By doing so, it's important to take into account the overall CO2 point balance while working on the three Rs: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.

Interconnected supply chains call for collaboration across businesses and public-private sectors. Technology platforms come into play, for instance reusable packaging logistics.

I believe in incentive-based policies, such as long-term low interest loans. They have been significant for several decades to finance investments into our environmental initiatives , eg reusable packaging, reduction of water usage, thermal power plant.

BUSINESS leaders need to embrace a circular economy within their organisations to reduce waste and allow for better use of resources. We have a ""throw away"" culture and not much thought is given to what happens after a product is consumed.

Many consumers throw away because there are not enough safe or practical options available to repair, reuse, recycle or upcycle.

Governments need to start at the source and take responsibility for the amount of waste produced within their own countries. We know taxes and incentives can push organisations to redesign and produce responsibly at source. The bigger question is why have governments allowed it to become such a huge problem in the first place?

PLASTICS pollution lies in the profligate use of the synthetic polymer and despite its usefulness, they are not biodegradable as these are unnatural products not found in nature with no bacteria available to decompose them.

They pollute the environment at a staggering rate and are killing wildlife. Over time, plastics choke our whole global eco-system until certain bacteria strains can be cultivated and bred to decompose these plastic.

The private sector alone cannot combat such uses. It has to be a global concerted effort by governments to cease the production and use of such non bio-degradable polymer and to replace with biodegradable substitutes. Government can start to tax the use of avoidable plastics to discourage usage and to shift consumers' behaviors to use less plastics to more sustainable materials.

NO doubt each private sector entity is taking steps to reduce plastic waste. We as an organisation have completely removed single-use plastics as an office policy, and moved to sustainable and recyclable product packaging.

The critical issue is education, awareness and creating consciousness throughout organisations. The concept of a ""circular economy"" and even reverse logistics where transit is used both ways to reduce pollutants and maximise sustainability, is fast becoming the approach to be adopted. Private sector collaborations in the form of shared understandings, resources and partnerships like ZeroWaste SG or initiatives led by the Singapore Environment Council will ensure the problem is combated but in a sustainable and effective manner.

REDUCING pollution in the ocean is a tricky issue as it requires the full coordinated effort from various interest groups, from plastic makers to recyclers, companies and consumers.

Product packaging should be re-evaluated either by reducing plastic usage or changing to an alternative material without affecting the product application. Using JuzTalent, our in-house HRIS solution as an example, it is created to improve the scalability of HR administrative tasks and concurrently eliminate paper usage.

This issue requires both a bottom-up and top-down approach. Governments should impose heavy fines on companies/recyclers that deposit waste material into the ocean. At the same time, with the power of social media, unsightly images of sea animals being suffocated by plastics should be widely shared. This will create more awareness and concern in consumers and hopefully result in fewer purchases in single-use plastic products or of unfriendly environmentally-unfriendly brands.

RECYCLING and reducing the environmental impact is a global challenge and it starts from within the organisation. At Alstom, we strive to reduce energy intensity through ongoing energy action plans and recycle 88 per cent of our waste; we also monitor strictly our air and water emissions.

This also translates to our solutions for sustainable transport. Alstom's comprehensive eco-design policy prioritises using clean, recyclable, and natural materials, reducing noise and vibrations as well as air emissions, and handling the end-of-life management of products - particularly in maintenance activities. The environmental impact of these vehicles is minimised through increased energy efficiency achieved by the use of innovations such as electrical braking, sensor-based air-conditioning, and non-hazardous materials for construction. It is in these initiatives and innovations that we strive to provide a greener environment.

WATER is an important precious natural resource. A multi–prong approach is necessary to address the declining quality of our oceans and environmental contamination from industrial and domestic sources has serious implications.

Among the sources of marine pollution, plastic debris is one of the most common but also challenging to manage. To curb plastic pollution, apart from possible direct regulation through legislation, adoption of innovative water treatment technologies and proper treatment / recycling of hazardous waste is essential. Some form of economic incentives to influence behavioural change will also help.

The real estate industry can play a key role in combating marine pollution. Developers can ensure that their projects give priority to efficient water and waste management with a focus on the health and well-being of occupants and adoption of eco-friendly practices to reduce carbon footprint. Developers can join hands with the government and industry partners to create greater public awareness, encourage public participation in clean-up campaigns, and collectively identify pollution sources and implement remedial measures.",Singapore,2019.06
739,China releases new industry catalogue encouraging foreign investment - Xinhua | English.news.cn,"BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the Ministry of Commerce on Sunday jointly released a revised catalogue of industries that encourage foreign investment.

The catalogue includes an industry catalogue for encouraging foreign investment nationwide and a catalogue of advantageous industries for foreign investment in the country's central, western and northeastern regions.

It is expected to give better play to the positive role of foreign investment in China's industrial development, technological progress and structural optimization, said an official with the NDRC.

The number of listed sectors where foreign investment is encouraged see marked rise. Compared with the 2017 version, the new catalogue for encouraging foreign investment nationwide has 67 newly-added items and 45 modified items, while the catalogue of advantageous industries in central, western and northeastern regions has introduced 54 new items.

Over 80 percent of the newly-added or revised items of the nationwide catalogue point to the manufacturing industry. Foreign investment is more encouraged in sectors such as high-end manufacturing, intelligent manufacturing, and green manufacturing.

New items have been added to encourage foreign investment in 5G core components, etching machines for integrated circuits, chip packaging equipment, and cloud computing equipment.

Besides, new entries have been added for artificial intelligence, clean production, carbon capture and circular economy.

The catalogue for the central and western regions further adds labor-intensive as well as advanced and applicable technology industries and supporting facilities, giving the regions greater support to their embracing of industrial transfer of foreign-funded businesses.

China attracted a record high foreign direct investment (FDI) of 138.3 billion U.S. dollars last year, bucking a global trend of FDI slide. In the first five months of this year, the country saw an FDI inflow of 54.6 billion dollars, up 3.7 percent year on year.",China,2019.06
740,New Zealand's single-use plastic shopping bags ban kicks in - Xinhua | English.news.cn,"WELLINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The ban on single-use plastic shopping bags, which takes effect on Monday, is ""a step towards healthier oceans and giving nature a hand,"" Associate Environment Minister Eugenie Sage said on Sunday.

""New Zealanders are proud of our country's clean, green reputation and want to help ensure we live up to it. Ending the use of single-use plastic shopping bags helps do that,"" Sage said in a statement.

""From tomorrow, 1 July, the ban will cover all retailers,"" she said, adding new regulations mean local businesses can no longer provide their customers with a single-use plastic shopping bag to carry their purchases.

""The ban should ensure less plastic ends up in rivers, streams, stormwater systems and the ocean so seabirds, fish, turtles, and marine mammals are less vulnerable to being harmed by it,"" Sage said.

""At the start of plastic-free July, the plastic shopping bag ban is one step to tackling New Zealand's waste issues,"" she said, adding the government also needs to recharge materials recovery and recycling systems and shift to a circular economy.

New Zealand's mainstream supermarkets have already made the change away from single-use plastic shopping bags and report that this has stopped tens of millions of bags being handed out.

New Zealanders appear to have made a rapid transition to reusable bags, with 56 percent of shoppers in April 2018 bringing reusable bags increasing to 91 percent always, or often, bringing their own reusable bag in September 2018, according to a survey research done for the Ministry for the Environment.

""Lightweight single-use plastic shopping bags pollute nature because they are easily transported by wind and water. The phase-out encourages people to act with nature in mind,"" Sage said.

Businesses were given six months ahead of the ban to phase-out single-use plastic bags. There is an online portal on the ministry's website so people can report businesses that are still giving out single-use plastic bags after the ban takes effect.",China,2019.06
746,"Except US, all G20 nations pledge full commitment to Paris climate deal","Nineteen members of the G20, except the US, on Saturday reaffirmed their commitment to the ""full implementation"" of the Paris climate deal, agreeing to look into a wide range of clean technologies and approaches.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other world leaders attending the G20 summit in the Japanese city of Osaka agreed to a climate change deal similar to that signed in Argentina last year.

As at the 2018 G20 meeting in Buenos Aires, the new declaration said that the US reiterated its decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement ""because it disadvantages American workers and taxpayers.""

The document said the signatories to the Paris Agreement reaffirmed their commitment to its full implementation.

To help achieve climate change prevention, the G20 nations ""will look into a wide range of clean technologies and approaches, including smart cities, ecosystem and community based approaches, nature based solutions and traditional and indigenous knowledge,"" the final document said.

The text maintained a ""similar"" commitment to fight climate change as in previous declarations in Buenos Aires and Hamburg, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said at a press conference at the end of the summit.

""We've succeeded after days and nights of negotiations to have again, after all, a 19 to 1 declaration, where the 19 signatory countries of the Paris agreement commit to the same things as we did in Buenos Aires,"" Merkel was quoted as saying by the Politico.

""We say that this process is 'irreversible' and we say that we have made our commitments [to cut greenhouse gas emissions] and will do a review again in 2020 to see whether we must make new commitments,"" she said.

The leaders discussed urgent problems with pollution, loss of biodiversity and climate change, noting the need for a shift in thinking about financing and the involvement of businesses in innovation and investment in sustainable growth.

But their declaration included a recognition of the US decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on reducing carbon emissions that lead to global warming and noted American progress from 2005 to 2017 in reducing such pollution.

In the light of recent extreme weather events and disasters, the G20 leaders recognised the urgent need for addressing complex and pressing global issues and challenges, including climate change, resource efficiency, air, land, fresh water and marine pollution, including marine plastic litter, biodiversity loss, sustainable consumption and production, urban environmental quality and other environmental issues.

The declaration said that a paradigm shift is needed where the virtuous cycle of environment and growth is accelerated through innovations, and with business communities playing an important role, in synergy with the public sector.

To this end, they stressed the importance of accelerating the virtuous cycle and leading transformations to a resilient, inclusive, and sustainable future.

They emphasised the importance of taking concrete and practical actions and collecting international best practices and wisdom from around the world, mobilizing public and private finance, technology and investment and improving business environments.

They emphasised the importance of providing financial resources to assist developing countries with respect to both mitigation and adaptation in accordance with the Paris Agreement.

They recognised that improving resource efficiency through policies and approaches, such as circular economy, sustainable materials management, the 3Rs(reduce, reuse, recycle) and waste to value, contributes to the SDGs, as well as to addressing a wide range of environmental challenges, enhancing competitiveness and economic growth, managing resources sustainably, and creating jobs.

The G20 leaders reiterated that measures to address marine litter, especially marine plastic litter and microplastics, need to be taken nationally and internationally by all countries in partnership with relevant stakeholders.

749,"British Deputy High Commissioner: ‘UK, India working together for sustainable urban growth’","HYDERABAD: The United Kingdom and India are committed to work together and develop innovative solutions to the challenges faced by cities with the aim of promoting sustainable urban growth.

British Deputy High Commissioner Andrew Fleming stated during his special address at the ""Knowledge Dissemination Workshop"" on Waste Management organised here on Friday.

UK’s expertise is being utilised to solve the pressing issues like solid waste management (smw) in Indian cities as they are growing rapidly.

The SWM project is a part of the wider UK-India engagement in the urban sector, with scope for more mutually beneficial opportunities to partner with the Telangana government in the coming months, Flemming said.

In this regard, the British High Commission has undertaken a programme on ‘Technical Assistance on Waste Management and Circular Economy’, bringing international experts to Hyderabad to share best practices through a series of knowledge exchange workshops.

""UK’s Environment Plan sets out a target of maximising the value and benefits we get from our resources, doubling resource productivity by 2050. Our goal is to work towards eliminating all avoidable waste by 2050 and all avoidable plastic waste by end of 2042. Our ambition is to become a world leader in using resources efficiently and reducing the amount of waste we create as a society,"" he said.

""The UN has predicted that the human population will rise from 7.6 billion to 11.2 billion by the end of the century. This coupled with rising consumption will create relentless demand for materials and fossil fuels and putting unsustainable pressure on the planet's resources. The only way to resolve this is by transitioning from a linear economy, where one can make, use and dispose of, to a regenerative, circular economy, where we reduce, reuse and recycle,"" he said.

758,Circular economy's potential remains unrealised,"The importance and necessity of a circular economy, which means cheaper products and services and reduced congestion and pollution, cannot be overemphasised

At the industrial estate road in Vapi, the hub of paper mills in south Gujarat, there is feverish activity. Lorries carrying imported wastepaper make a beeline. Mountains of trash can be seen heaped inside the mills, ready to be recycled. In what can be considered a golden example of the circular economy model, paper recycling is booming in India, with a surge in the import of wastepaper.

Worldwide, countries are refusing to be dumping grounds of trash, forcing developed economies, which are huge waste generators, to look for alternatives. In 2017, China announced a ban on the import of 24 types of scraps, including paper, applicable from January 1, 2018.

The announcement sent shock waves in the UK, the US and the European Union, which are still trying to find ways to manage their waste. What came as a shocker to the West gave a new lease of life to paper manufacturers in India, many of whom had been struggling due to the shortage of raw materials.

Paper already accounts 50 per cent of all dry waste generated in urban India, followed by plastic (14 per cent), glass (6 per cent), textile (5 per cent), wood (3 per cent), metal (1.5 per cent) and residue (20 per cent), as per a 2011 working paper prepared by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion under the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry. After the Chinese ban, India’s import of wastepaper spiked.

The figure stood at 4 million tonnes in 2017-18, but grew by 23 per cent to around 5 million tonnes between April and December 2018. This increase was just 1.3 per cent in 2015-16 and 2.2 per cent in 2016-17. With abundant supply, wastepaper prices fell by 16 per cent to an average Rs 13.7 per kg in the first half of 2018-19 from Rs 16.3 per kg in the same period previous year.

Wastepaper import is also helping India meet the domestic demand, which rose from 9.3 million tonnes in 2008 to 17.1 million tonnes in 2018, as per the Directorate General of Commercial Inte-lligence and Statistics (DGCIS).

“The waste dumped by Western countries in India is fibre-rich. Here, we have plenty of labour for recycling paper and the cost of production is also low. So, it is a win-win situation,” says Akhilesh Kumar Sharma, a paper technologist and the chief executive officer of Rama Pulp and Papers Ltd based in Vapi.

Recycled paper is used as a raw material in India for manufacturing newsprint, paperboard, duplex kraft paper, note-books, packaging materials and tissue papers. It is also exported to the US and the UK as finished products.

Apart from Vapi, Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh, Baleswar in Odisha, Amritsar in Punjab, Nagpur in Madhya Pradesh, Rajahmundry and Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, and Sathyamanglam in Tamil Nadu are the major wastepaper recycling hubs of the country.

Though things look good right now, the circular economy model of paper recycling poses a risk of importing contaminants and India runs the risk of becoming a dumpyard like China was. “European countries do not conduct any formal sorting due to the lack of cheap labour.

So, paper waste mixed with contaminants like plastic, glass and aluminium gets imported here. Also, while some mills have a proper system to dispose plastic mixed with paper, most just dump it in the surrounding areas, says Sharma.

Import and export of paper, paperboard, and paper product wastes is regulated as per the Hazardous Wastes (Management, Handling and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2008. The rules do not permit contaminants for 31 of the 48 graded of imported wastepaper and up to two per cent contaminants for the remaining. The consignment has to be sent back to the exporting country in case of any violation of the rules. Though there are consignment checks at major ports, the procedures are lax and sometimes the rate of contamination is as high as 10 per cent, say paper manufacturers.

“During custom examination we present documents for clearance. A pre-inspection certification agency should check how much contamination a consignment has. But mostly the cargo is passed without checks,” says Gagan Ahluwalia, founder of Paper Fiber Impex, a Delhi-based wastepaper importing firm. “In China, these consignments go through efficient scanners that check for contamination. Such scanners are hardly available in any Indian port,” he says.





 THE CONCEPT OF reuse is not new to India. The practice of younger siblings wearing clothes worn by elders, and babies being clothed in used garments is common across cultures. Exchanging used cloths for steel utensils when door-to-door vendors come knocking too is quite prevalent. What do these venders do with the clothes they collect? Raghubir Nagar in Delhi houses a market where such clothes are sold.

Considered to be one of Asia’s largest markets for second-hand garments, the day here breaks as early as 3 am for street vendor Karamdas Prakash and his wife Rekha, who sell 50 to 100 clothes daily. The market has some 5,000 vendors engaged in this ancestral business. By 11 am, stillness descends and the market is closed. Post 11 am, Prakash and other vendors sell steel utensils door-to-door in exchange for clothes in different parts of the National Capital Region.

“A considerable number of people cannot afford new clothes. Here, they can get a pair of good jeans in less than Rs 50. It is good that longevity of clothes is being extended this way,” says Prakash.

Over the past 20 years India’s import of used clothes has also risen — from Rs 3.3 crore in 1996-97 to Rs 615.8 crore in 2018-19, as per the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry. In 2017, the top three countries to export used clothes to India were the US (47 per cent), South Korea (18 per cent) and Canada (12 per cent).

Mostly, imported clothes are used as raw material for manufacturing new items. In Panipat, Haryana, there are many industries where yarn extracted from woollens and hosiery is used to make blankets, shawls, curtains and bedsheets. Bulk of these items are bought by international humanitarian agencies and sent to Africa and other countries.

Pritam Singh Sachdeva, president of Northern India Roller Spinners’ Association, says that the turnover of Panipat’s recycling industry stands at Rs 7,000- Rs 8,000 crore from exports and 80 per cent of the business is based on recycled yarn.

Apart from Delhi and Panipat, Kandla in Gujarat is another major hub of used textiles. The Kandla Special Economic Zone is one of India’s largest centres for sorting and grading textile waste.

There are a few sectors of circular economy in India that are yet to pick up pace but have tremendous scope for growth. A 2018 report by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI) says that “half-a-trillion dollars worth of economic value can be unlocked” through circular economy business models by 2030 in India. One such sector is e-waste. The FICCI report says that just extracting gold from e-waste in India can yield $1 billion.

THERE ARE NO government figures for e-waste generated in India, but as per the “Global E-waste Monitor 2017”, a report published by the United Nations University, India generated about 2 million tonnes of e-waste in 2016. However, the country’s e-waste recycling potential is abysmal. As per the Central Pollution Control Board, India’s formal sector could only recycle 0.099 million tonnes e-waste in 2015-16. To improve the country’s e-waste recycling capacity, the government is setting up e-waste recycling units in major cities.

However, informal recycling operations have been in place for a long time, with over 1 million poor people in India involved in manual recycling operations, says the “Global E-waste Monitor 2017”. They, in fact, recycle about 95 per cent of the country’s e-waste, says a 2007 study by Manufacturers’ Association for Information Technology, an association of informationtechnology companies, based in Delhi. Bringing them to the mainstream will not only streamline the way they recycle the hazardous waste, but also help the country realise its e-waste recovery potential.

One of the prerequisites for harnessing the business and economic potential of e-waste is proper inventorisation. This will attract investors to the e-waste recycling industry as they can clearly evaluate the resource recovery potential of materials contained in e-waste.

Scrap plastics and end-of-life-vehicles (ELVs) are the other sectors that can grow massively. The FICCI report says that 40 per cent of plastic waste in India is uncollected and, if properly managed, represents a $2 billion opportunity. The report also says that over 8 million tonnes of steel can be recovered from ELVs in India by 2025, representing a $2.7 billion opportunity.

“A circular economy development path could significantly mitigate negative environmental externalities. For example, greenhouse gas emissions could be 23 per cent lower in 2030 and 44 per cent lower in 2050 compared with the current development scenario, helping India deliver on its targets promised in the recently ratified Paris Agreement,” says a 2016 report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

A circular economy also means cheaper products and services, and reduced congestion and pollution. As such, its importance and necessity cannot be overemphasised.",India,2019.06
774,Why we need a circular economy,"Reusing products is not only necessary for a sustainable future, but also makes business sense

The ""Choose Used"" collection promoted by Hollywood actor Olivia Wilde aims to reduce textile waste. It is available on resale website Thredup

Rwanda has a reason for opposing used clothes. Pushed by flawed trade regimes and myopic policies, these goods have nearly decimated the textile, apparel and leather industries in Africa. But elsewhere, a movement of sorts has gained momentum with celebri ties urging consumers to choose second-hand clothes for a sustainable future.

“The textiles system operates in an almost completely linear way: large amounts of non-renewable resources are extracted to produce clothes that are often used for only a short time, after which the materials are mostly sent to landfill or incinerated,” says a report by UK-based think-tank Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

Globally, clothing production doubled between 2000 and 2015. During the period the number of garments purchased each year increased by 60 per cent but the average number of times a garment was worn before disposal declined by 36 per cent. More than $500 billion worth of natural resources are lost every year due to clothing underutilisation and the lack of recycling, says the report.

The volume and variety of natural resources that end up in landfill due to the take-make-disposal model is immense if one considers the diversification of industrial economy and technological advancements. “Some 65 billion tonnes of raw materials entered the economic system in 2010, and this figure is expected to grow to around 82 billion tonnes in 2020,” says a 2014 report of the World Economic Forum.

Three planet Earths would be required to accommodate the gargantuan waste humanity would produce by 2050, warns environmental group, the World Wide Fund for Nature.

Amid this impending crisis, the idea of circular economy is fast catching up. A paper published in ScienceDirect in August 2018 says in the past five to 10 years, the concept has received significant attention at various levels.

There has been a 50 per cent increase in academic publications on circular economy in the past five years. Worldwide, govern ments, particularly those facing a growing crisis of raw materials, are making the concept an integral part of their policies.

Consider China. The world’s most populous country is among the first to have realised the potential of circular economy as far back as in the 1990s. In 2008, the country adopted the Circular Economy Promotion Law and has established a commission which is responsible for planning and coordination of the circular economy.

It monitors a scheme, Trade Old for Remanufactured, which aims to motivate citizens to recycle and reuse. Under the scheme, customers get 10 per cent discount if they trade their old equipment for remanufactured items. Its 11th five-year plan has been drafted keeping in focus three R’s—reduce, reuse and recycle.

In 2017, the government introduced Circular Economy Policy Port-folio which ensures that manufacturers focus of ecofriendly designs and remain responsible for collecting, transporting, recycling and responsibly disposing of the products at the end of their life.

Japan is the other Asian player which sees circular economy as a mechanism to tide over resource constraints. It processes and reproduces its waste in such way that 98 per cent of the metals get recycled. Even 12 years ago, only five per cent of waste ended up in landfills.

In fact, in 2001, Japan was credited for introducing the first take-back law in the world, which forces retailers and manufacturers to take back used air conditioners, televisions, washing machines and refrigerators.

Under the law, consumers share the responsibility of manufacturers and the government to initiate the take-back process and pay a fee for collection and recycling of products. The law, though appears stringent, makes sense in a country whose volcanic and mountainous terrain offers limited space for landfills.

In Europe, Germany is the leader when it comes to sustainability goals. As per the Circular Economy Index prepared by media house The Politico, Germany recycles 65 per cent of its materials and sends 30 per cent to waste-to-energy plants. Only five per cent goes to landfills. The country, in fact, holds an estimated 1,260 patents that deal with sustainable products, processes and services.

Global bodies like the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) are also promoting circular economy through various events. In 2017, WEF and its partners established the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy, or PACE, to drive action towards a circular economy. Under PACE, over 50 business and government leaders have come together to create favourable conditions for widespread adoption of the concept. However, UNEP urges global leaders and think-tanks to expand the scope of circular economy beyond just recycling products.

It points out that the value-retention processes (VRPs) like remanufacturing, refurbishment, repair, direct reuse and recycling can be complementary. In a report, it points out that VRPs create net-positive outcomes by enabling product-level efficiency gains in materials and energy use, as well as help control emissions and waste generation.

Remanufacturing and comprehensive refurbishment can contribute to reduced emissions by 79 to 99 per cent in many sectors. Remanufacturing can reduce new material requirement by 80 to 98 per cent.

Comprehensive refurbishing saves more materials on an average, and it stands between 82 and 99 per cent. Repair saves an even higher share, between 94 and 99 per cent; and arranging direct reuse largely does not require any inputs of new materials. This can help us save gold, silver, indium, iridium and tungsten which can near depletion very soon.

It now remains to be seen whether countries would see their used products as waste and dump on poorer countries or try to achieve resource efficiency for a sustainable future.",India,2019.06
788,The circular economy: Africa’s historic pivot,"African governments have increasingly been taking a stand on potentially controversial issues, including trade policy, land redistribution and macro-economic and debt-management policies

The year 2018 was marked by tremendous economic and political turbulence around the world. And yet, for future historians, it may well be the year when Africa started to claim its intellectual and economic-policy independence.

The unlikely trigger for what could turn out to be a continent-wide strategic shift was Rwanda’s decision to increase tariffs on imported secondhand clothes and footwear in support of its local garment industry.

This provoked an immediate hostile response from the US, which suspended duty-free status for Rwandan textile exports under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), America’s flagship trade legislation for the continent.

For a small, landlocked African country that relies heavily on trade, this was a big deal. But the fact that Rwanda held its ground confirmed that times have changed. If Rwanda is willing to risk preferential access to the US market in order to develop its domestic garment industry, then it must be confident that it will find alternative markets for its exports.

Meanwhile, other African countries have also adopted a more independent attitude vis-à-vis the major trading powers.

African governments have increasingly been taking a stand on a wide range of potentially controversial issues, including trade policy in East Africa, land redistribution in Southern Africa, and macro-economic and debt-management policies in North Africa.

African governments’ motive for stepping up now is not only economic; it is also about dignity, intellectual freedom, and a willingness to risk charting one’s own course.

And, more broadly, African leaders recognise that the ongoing trans-formation of the global economy means that no country will have enough power to impose its strategic preferences on others, even when they are much smaller, as in the case of Rwanda and the US.

Empirical research from the World Economic Forum (WEF) shows that tariff reductions and market access have become much less relevant for economic growth than was the case a generation ago.

Trade is no longer about manufacturing a product in one country and selling it elsewhere; rather, it is about cooperating across borders and time zones to minimise production costs and maximise market coverage.

The WEF estimates that, “Reducing supply chain barriers to trade could increase [global] GDP up to six times more than removing tariffs.”

If all countries could bring the performance of border administration, together with transport and communications infrastructure, up to just half the level of global best practice, global GDP would grow by $2.6 trillion (4.7 per cent), and total exports would increase by $1.6 trillion (14.5 per cent).

By comparison, the complete elimination of all tariffs worldwide would boost global GDP by only $400 billion (0.7 per cent), and exports by $1.1 trillion (10.1 per cent).

Clearly, global value chains are now the dominant framework for trade. And, as we have seen, African countries such as Rwanda (as well as Ethiopia and Morocco) are already taking advantage of this paradigm shift. Rather than wasting time in unproductive policy discussions over tariffs, they are redirecting their strategies to focus on trade facilitation.

True, today’s trade wars have disrupted international supply chains, and will continue to do so. But new constraints will also stimulate creativity and innovation.

For example, as Meghnad Desai of the London School of Economics points out, “In the light of advances in technologies such as 3D printing and artificial intelligence, it is not far-fetched to imagine that businesses could manufacture domestically the intermediate products that they currently import.”

In this case, trade would continue apace, “but the product mix would shift from intermediate to final products.”

Moreover, in an increasingly multipolar world, low-income countries will not have to rely solely on the West for financing and policy ideas (though they will have to be mindful of the risks of indebtedness and precarious governance frameworks). Even as global commerce has undergone a tectonic shift, traditional development thinking, policies, and practices have not.

Meanwhile, as the major emerging economies pursue technological and industrial development to escape the “middle-income trap,” they are altering the distribution of roles and responsibilities across the global production system.

Owing to the economic success of countries such as China, Vietnam, and Indonesia, other low-income economies in Africa and elsewhere now have substantial opportunities to boost employment in labour-intensive industries.

After all, China now produces many of the high-value-added goods that once were the exclusive preserve of advanced economies.

As China and others continue climbing the industrial and technological ladder, the necessary relocation of large parts of their supply chains to lower-cost countries will affect the costing and pricing of goods and labour everywhere. But developing countries can actually use their latecomer status to reap substantial economic benefits.

Despite the wildly exaggerated threat of automation, African countries, in particular, can exploit their lower factor costs to promote successful labour-intensive industries in which they have a comparative advantage.

For example, African countries can lower the cost of doing business by building strategically located production clusters and industrial parks (including for green industries). They are also in a strong position to attract foreign direct investment, which brings the positive externalities of technology and know-how transfer, managerial best practices, state-of-the-art learning, and access to large global markets.

If managed properly, this two-pronged approach could provide ample employment for a low-skilled labour force, while rapidly increasing fiscal revenues. And this, in turn, would allow for improvements to infrastructure in other areas, thus creating the conditions for long-term prosperity and social stability.

While trade agreements such as the AGOA are still very important to African countries, broader economic and techno-logical changes are opening up new opportunities, and smart policymakers are seizing them. This is a pivotal moment in North-South relations.

After centuries of being politically and intellectually tethered to advanced economies with little to show for it, Africa is striking out on a new path of self-affirmation.

In this quest for prosperity, African leaders and policymakers have proved ready to withstand sanctions, threats, and setbacks. They may not all have read Nietzsche, but they know that what “does not kill us, makes us stronger”.",India,2019.06

817,The circular economy: How Rwanda tries to chart its course in hostile global waters,"Wanting to move away from being a dumpyard of used clothings has meant angering Donald Trump's USA. The small east African country is trying to find a way out

An uneasy silence has enveloped over the once-vibrant Kimironko market in Rwanda’s capital town, Kigali. Sitting in a dim corner, Emmanuel Harindintwari listens intently as the other stallholders discuss an incident on the border that now threatens political and social stability in East Africa.

On May 24, the Rwandan security force gunned down two people, including a Ugandan national, for trying to smuggle used clothes into the country. Those were hand-me-downs from people living some tens of thousands of kilometres away across the North Atlantic Ocean, or beyond the Mediterranean Sea, which get sold across Africa as cheap garments and are the primary source of clothing across the continent.

But the Rwandan government does not want its citizens to sift through piles of cast-offs from wealthier nations. In its attempt to shed the “third world” label and “restore” people’s dignity, the government has been aggressively regulating the entry of used clothes and footwear into the country.

Since 2016-17, it has progressively increased taxes on these merchandise, first from $0.20 to $2.50 per kg and then to $4 in the next financial year. Tariff on used footwear has also jumped from $0.20 to $5. Simultaneously, the government has heightened surveillance along the country’s porous borders with Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, which are among the top importers of used clothing in Africa.

This has unnerved many of the 22,000 Rwandans engaged in the trade—right from wholesalers, retailers and vendors to those involved in washing, repairing and restyling products to fit the body shapes and sizes of Africans.

When asked about his business, Harindintwari points at a less-than-a-metre-wide stall, crowded with neatly folded used trousers, shirts and colourful bedcovers, and says: “These are all legally imported goods. But the raised tariff has made them so pricey that a bale of used clothes now costs $422 compared to $56 two years ago. If we pass this cost on to customers, we risk losing sales. If not, we incur heavy losses.”

Earlier, he recalls, these narrow corridors of Kimironko market used to overflow with discarded garments. Customers used to jostle to pull out a fine T-shirt with a famous logo or a high-fashion western dress. “I made a fortune selling those in the past 20 years. Today, I struggle to arrange money for my child’s school fees.”

Away from the market, on the outskirts of Kigali, Claudette Nyiraneza, a roadside vendor, explains how the tariff has made decent clothes unaffordable for an average Rwandan. “Earlier, one could buy a second-hand garment for 100 Rwandan franc ($0.11). Now, one has to shell out at least Rwf4,000 ($5) for a piece. This is almost a week’s salary for a farm worker or 10 days’ salary for a domestic help,” says Nyiraneza.

According to the World Bank, over 55.5 per cent people in this tiny landlocked country live below the international poverty line of $1.90 a day.





 OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY, the raised tariff on used clothes has rattled the world’s largest economy — the United States. In early 2017, just weeks after Donald Trump was sworn in as the president and the “America first” foreign policy was brought in, a little-known trade association, the Secondary Materials and Recycled Textiles Association (Smart) appealed to the government against the efforts in East Africa to phase out imports of second-hand clothing. It claims the region accounts for one-fifth of the total US exports of used clothes. A ban would cost the US 40,000 jobs and an annual export earning of $147 million.

In response, Trump first issued threats to Rwanda and then suspended its duty-free privileges on domestically made apparel under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). The preferential trade agreement between the US and 44 African countries allows the latter to sell 6,400 goods in the US market without paying import tariffs that most countries must pay and without being subject to import quota restrictions.

Following Trump’s order, the Rwandan government is now losing an estimated $1.5 million a year in export earnings. This is a huge sum for a country that has few natural resources and heavily depends on trade.

But President Kagame has labelled the trade war losses only as “short-term” and his government is adamant on its decision. Leaving behind the shadow of the 1994 genocide, which claimed the lives of 50,000 to 1 million people in just 100 days, the country’s GDP has been steadily growing at an impressive 7 per cent in the past two decades. Today, it is one of Africa’s fastest-growing economies.

The government now aims to transform Rwanda into an upper-middle income country by 2035. The government believes removing cheap used clothing and footwear from the domestic market is the only way to protect its local textile and leather manufacturers from unfair competition, and thereby bolster the country’s economy.

This vision was also at the heart of Rwanda’s neighbouring countries, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and South Sudan, which have in recent years formed the East African Community (EAC) and are emerging as a single market. According to a 2017 report by international non-profit USAID, EAC accounted for 12.5 per cent of the global imports of used clothing, worth $274 million in 2015.

In 2016, led by Kagame who is also the chairperson of EAC, these countries prepared a long-term development strategy, Vision 2050, that required them to strengthen their domestic manufacturing sector. Along with Rwanda, rest of the EAC countries pledged to phase out second-hand clothing by 2019, which they believe has dealt a severe blow to their once-thriving textile and leather industries. 



 Consider Kenya. Between 1960s and early 1980s, import of used clothes was banned in the country and the government promoted domestic production of textile and apparel to meet local consumption as well as to protect its cotton industry from foreign competition. In the 1980s, the country allowed second-hand clothes as donations for refugees from neighbouring countries. This gradually led to trade in the merchandise, shows a research done in 2017 by non-profit CUTS International.



 From the early 1990s, the government lifted the ban on used clothes as it focused on liberalisation and export promotion. By 2000, most of its domestic textile companies in Kenya had collapsed due to, among other factors, increased competition from used clothes.

According to Nairobi-based Kenya Association of Manufacturers, before 1990 the country had 52 textile mills and hundreds of garment companies, making its textile sector the second largest employer after public service. The country, at present, has only 17 players in spinning, weaving, knitting and fabric finishing. Only four of them are fully integrated textile mills.



 Similarly in the late 1960s, Uganda was the largest producer of cotton lint in Sub-Saharan Africa. Most of its produce was consumed locally for producing perfect clothing for the warm, sunny climate. But the market collapsed first due to domestic turmoil in the 1970s and the 1980s and then following economic liberalisation in the 1990s. Today, Uganda produces just a fourth of what it used to produce in the 1970s, shows a 2017 document by the UN Conference on Trade and Development. 



 The dwindling capacity and defunct mills of these countries further increased their dependency on cheap second-hand clothing, creating a vicious cycle. Today, over half the population in Kenya depends on imported cast-offs for affordable clothing. In 2013, the government collected $54 million in tariff revenue on 0.1 million tonnes of imported clothing and the industry employed 65,000 people.

Abel Kamau, head of the Kenya Association of Manufacturers, says his country is a major beneficiary of AGOA. Among EAC nations, it is the largest apparel exporter to the US. In 2017, it exported $410 million worth of goods to the US as compared to $43 million by Rwanda. Small wonder, Kenya was the first EAC country to roll back tariffs on used clothes when Trump threatened it with suspension from AGOA benefits. Tanzania and Uganda, which are among the world’s top 15 importers of used clothes, and Burundi followed suit. 



 What’s worse, these countries have been leaders in raw materials required for the textile industry. Rwanda, for instance, is known for its fine silk. Tanzania is still one of Africa’s top cotton producers. But industry experts say most of the cotton produced in EAC goes to Asia where it is spun, converted into apparel and shipped to the US and EU to be worn for two to three years and then shipped back to EAC as used clothing.



 The EAC region is also endowed with raw materials for footwear. Tanzania has a total of 22.8 million cattle, Kenya 17.5 million, Uganda 12.8 million, Rwanda 0.99 million and Burundi 0.74 million. But these countries can process leather only up to the preliminary wet blue stage, notes the research paper by CUTS International. Some 80 to 90 per cent of the wet blue leather is exported and only 10 per cent is left for processing to finished leather which is then used by artisanal shoemakers. Though there is a significant demand for footwear in the region, 80 per cent of the demand is met through imports out of which 60 per cent are second-hand shoes.

Today, Rwanda Stands alone in implementing import restrictions and in its fight against the US. As part of its drive towards establishing self-reliance in clothing, Rwanda launched the Made in Rwanda campaign in 2016 to mobilise support for local entrepreneurs and artisans as well as to encourage companies to improve garment production quality.

It is also urging traders to shift from used clothing to Made-in-Rwanda clothing. At present, the Rwandan textile industry relies on imported raw materials such as polyester and cotton, making locally produced clothes expensive. Polyester and cotton make up 40 per cent of the raw materials used in textile manufacturing, according to Ritesh Patel, the managing director of Utexrwa, a Kigali-based textile industry functioning since 1985. “This reliance makes local garments uncomp etitive in the market. A shirt made by Utexrwa sells for $5 in the market, which is still expensive compared to second-hand shirts,” Patel admits.

In a bid to reduce the cost of production, the Private Sector Federation (PSF) of Rwanda, dedicated to promote the interests of the business community, is encouraging collective investments in the textile industry. “We have put the manufacturers together when it comes to importing raw materials. When they order collectively, the rate is cheaper than individual imports,” says Eric Kabera, head of communications and marketing at PSF.

To benefit from advanced technologies available elsewhere in the world, the Rwandan government in May this year signed an agreement with Chinese firm Pink Mango C&D to establish a modern garment factory in the Kigali Special Economic Zone. Emmanuel Hategeka, deputy chief executive officer of the Rwanda Development Board, responsible for implementing Vision 2035, has said the move would help the country revive its mills by creating 7,500 jobs and reduce the import of used garments. The government is also encouraging civil servants to wear Rwandan designer clothes on the last Friday of every month.

But the government must not drop its guard. Rwanda’s market is already stacked with another variety of low-cost clothing — the ones made by China. All the efforts to become an upper-middle income country would go waste if Rwandans find those as suitable alternatives for imported second-hand clothes.

These are desperate times. Countries are trying to protect their own companies. AGOA, which initially offered development assistance to the low-income countries, has changed direction under the Trump administration. Writes Garth Frazer, a professor of economic analysis and public policy at the University of Toronto, Canada, who is also a member of the International Growth Centre Trade Research Group, “What is deeply concerning is when the members of EAC decided to increase the restrictions on used-clothes imports, the current US administration responded by threatening to remove AGOA benefits for them.”",India,2019.06

856,An Insight Into Circular Economy,"A few days back, the unemployment data was the focal point of Indian economy and now the focus has shifted to a comment made by CEO of Niti Aayog, Amitabh Kant in an event in Delhi on Monday that the circular economy can generate more than 1.4 -2 crore jobs in India.

In this particular post, Outlook Money takes a quick look at the concept on circular economy.

For a long time our economy has been linear and constituted three important stages, one was production that involves converting raw materials into the product, then after using those products thy are thrown out. There is no concept of reusing or recycling. Now, with the economy on an upward spiral and the exponentially rising population, the concerns for depletion of resources and raw materials has also gained fair amount of traction. To face all the pressing issues that the economy is facing right now, the only option for us is to move to circular economy.

So basically, circular economy is an industrial system that embraces restoration and regeneration, putting an end to use and throw concept. This economic system is seen as an alternative to linear economy that is all about make, use and dispose. Thus in the circular economic system the aim is to use products optimally, to do as much as refurbishments, repackaging, remanufacturing. So the basic objective is to keep things in use as long as possible.

Is this claim of generating 1.4 million jobs right or wrong?

Looking at the other parts of the world, the claim seems to be true. In 2014, European Commission estimated that jobs associated with circular economy employed 3.9 million people. And International Labour Organisation has projected that under circular economy worldwide, the employment would grow by 0.1% by 2030. The 2018 report by Cambridge Econometrics and Trinomics and ICF titled as concludes that circular economy will add 0.5 % to Europe’s GDP and a net increase of 700,000 jobs. A 2017 report by Circle Economy and Ehero estimates that 8 % of the Dutch workforce is currently employed in circular economy jobs. So after looking at the data from all other countries of the world, it seems true that circular economy has potential to generate 1.4 crore jobs in next 5-7 years.

Which countries have already embraced circular economy?

There are many countries in the world that have a piece of legislation that made mandatory on every ones part to reuse the products. Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden, Japan, Scotland are a few countries those who have adopted legislation to push the reuse and refurbish things. These countries have their own goals set for the respective years in order to get desired result from this economical transition. For example: The Danish government set a goal to recycle 50% of all household waste by 2022. Similarly many other countries are also have set goals. China also has circular economy in its policy since 2000.

What to hope for?

Now, with this comment of Amitabh Kant, now the speculations are rife that whether the government will bring in any piece of legislation, taking cue from European countries such as Denmark, Sweden and Netherlands. To get clarity on this issue we will have to wait and watch, that what necessary actions this government is going to take.",India,2019.06

Bangkok, Thailand June 2019 – Following its successful product launch of ‘Sabzu’ at ThaiFex 2019 and ambitious plans to take leadership role in global Specialty Foods industry, the Southeast Asia’s foods manufacturer NR Instant Produce (NRF) continues to conquer yet another proud achievement across the globe- this time in New York City- towards feeding the world through sustainability with granting the highest regenerative agriculture grant to a US-based innovation tool in advancing Soil 3.0 that’ll change the way farms live, eat, and breathe.

Earlier in 2019, NRF has announced a corporate rebranding and clear commitments to both sustain and revolutionize the foods industry as well as the specialty food business. Now, they are pioneering a path few food manufacturers have done- supporting, investing, and granting funds to innovative companies that can promise a healthy food system that can nourish 10 Billion people and sustain earthly resources.

As CEO of NRF and Chairman of Path Foundation, Mr. Danai Pathomvanich has flown to New York City to attend as one of the founding donors of initiative and a member of the selection committee to present the Moonshot Prize at FoodShot Global, a non-profit organization of world-class partners empowering bold ideas and innovative companies to accelerate the transformation to a healthy, sustainable, and equitable food system. FoodShot Global launched its investment platform in 2018 aimed to accelerate food system transformations through annual challenges called ‘Moonshot for Better Foods’- a global call for entrepreneurs, researchers, and advocates on a specific topic within the food and agriculture space. Applicants with most qualified solutions are then selected to receive grants or equity prizes from the FoodShot’s integrated capital platform. Best in-class candidates will receive equity and debt financing for their business; cash prizes will be rewarded for rising stars working within research, social enterprise, and advocacy. In 2018, Moonshot For Better Foods topic was Innovating Soil 3.0 Solutions. This year’s topic was Soil 3.0 under the theme ‘regenerative agriculture’ – an aligned mission for Path Foundation (a founding donor of FoodShot Global) and a core philosophy all too familiar to NRF.

A total of four prizes were awarded; two Moonshot prizes of $250,000, a research grant of $35,000, and a social equity prize of $3,000,000 to Trace Genomics. Mr. Danai handed out the Moonshot Prize of $ 250,000 to COMET-Farm, a Colorado-based Whole Farm and Ranch Carbon and Greenhouse Gas Accounting System. COMET-Farm estimates the ‘carbon footprint’ for all or part of farming and ranch operations then allows farmers to evaluate different options for reducing GHG emissions and sequestering more carbon. General guidance on the system is provided about potential changes to your management practices that are likely to sequester carbon and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Amazingly, the system also uses detailed spatially-explicit data on climate and soil conditions specifically for location and allows farmers to enter detailed information for their field and livestock operations to produce an accurate estimate tailored to your specific situation. How’s that for reducing world’s carbon footprint?

The need to save the world and the need to save our health has been given media attention, however, the need to save on our soil has been something largely ignored. The Food And Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has cited that more than 90% of all the Earth’s soil could be degraded by 2050 as our world continues to extract higher tolls to produce more for a burgeoning population,” commented Mr. Danai Pathomvanich, CEO of NR Instant Produce (NRF).

“NRF’s vision aims to a make the world more sustainable with food products that are made from regenerative farming. We are grateful for government organizations that support this cause and without the help of world’s leading partners, organizations such as FoodShot Global, and local communities themselves, this goal of food system sustainability will not be reached. To enable us to achieve this, NRF also supports and seek to work with innovative startups who are focused not just on the science of regenerative agriculture, but the collaboration to make it accessible to the global community. This way, we will succeed in helping improve the farming system in Thailand that we currently work with and hopefully, the entire industry as a whole,” added Mr. Danai.

In collaboration with Path Foundation and FoodShot Global, NRF is announcing qualifying Thai entrepreneurs, policy makers, NGOs, and others to apply and get involved with the next MoonShot For Better Foods Challenge 2020. Everything will be bigger and better, with prizes up to $1,000,000 in grant money and $20,000,000 in social equity.

885,Circular Economy likely to generate 1.4 crore jobs in 5-7 years - Amitabh Kant,"Mr Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog said that Circular Economy has the potential to generate 1.4 crore jobs in next 5-7 years and create lakhs of new entrepreneurs. Speaking at the '3rd Edition of Circular Economy Symposium 2019' organised by FICCI, Mr Kant said that sustainable development and resource circularity is the need of the hour to implement Circular Economy.

Mr Kant further highlighted that by 2050, world population would reach 9.7 billion of which 3 billion people would prosper to middleclass consumption level. This would require 71 per cent more resources per capita, thereby raising total mineral and material demand from 50 billion tonnes in 2014 to 130 billion tonnes in 2050.

Mr Kant added that if the 'End of Life Vehicle' policy was implemented with dated emission standards then by 2021, over 22 million vehicles will be off the road. This would include 80 per cent two-wheelers, 14 per cent cars, and 3 per cent each of three-wheelers and commercial vehicles. ""End of Life Vehicles present huge business opportunity for growth, wealth creation and jobs,"" he added.

He stressed upon the need for promoting non-government organizations to spread awareness and developing Circular Economy as a national agenda. ""This initiative should be firmly supported as these non-government organisations operate at grass-root level and can be useful agents of change,"" said Mr Kant.",India,2019.06
887,Circular economy can generate 1.4 crore jobs in 5-7 years: NITI Aayog CEO,"Circular economy has potential to create nearly one-and-half crore jobs in next five to seven years and create lakhs of new entrepreneurs, NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said here on Monday.Speaking at ‘Circular Economy Symposium 2019’ organised by FICCI, Kant said that resource circularity and sustainable development are the need of the hour to implement the circular economy. “Circular economy has the potential to generate 1.4 crore jobs in the next 5-7 years & create lakhs of new entrepreneurs. Resource circularity is need of the hour to implement circular economy,” he said.

A circular economy is an alternative to a traditional linear economy (make, use, dispose) in which resources are kept in use for as long as possible, the maximum value is extracted from them whilst in use, the products and materials are recovered and regenerated at the end of each service life. This economic system is aimed at minimising waste and making the most of resources.

Kant underlined the need for legislation to promote the circular economy in the country. “Several countries have recognised the centrality of the circularity as the new paradigm for sustainable development. They have not only embraced the concept of circular economy in their daily life but also brought in regulations to ensure higher compliance and promote more reuse, refurbishment and recycling,” he said.

He said that by 2050, the world population would reach 9.7 billion of which 3 billion people would prosper to middle-class consumption level.

 This would require 71 per cent more resources per capita, thereby raising total mineral and material demand from 50 billion tonnes in 2014 to 130 billion tonnes in 2050, he noted.

891,"Circular economy could benefit industry, help agri sector: NITI Aayog Chief","NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant has said that adopting circular economy practices would benefit the industry.

""Application of industry's 4.0 technologies can be integrated to reuse and recycle,"" he said.

Seeing the potential benefits of taking steps towards a circular economy, Kant urged the industry to develop sound business models around it. He also added that the NITI Aayog has developed an adequate framework for it.

NITI Aayog drew up a National Material Recycling Policy draft and held a stakeholder discussion earlier this year. However, Kant said that only policies and defining roles were not enough, as this needs to be followed up by appropriate legislation.

The National Material Recycling Policy aims to lay down a framework for the recycling industry and encourage large scale recycling for all goods. It also aims at creating more jobs through this industry's growth. According to Kant, recycling of major waste could generate 1.2 to 1.3 crore jobs.

He added that circular economy practices could also help the ailing agricultural sector. ""The agriculture sector is perpetually challenged to provide supply for a large population. A circular economy will help the agriculture sector become more efficient,"" he said.

Several countries like China and the European Union have already taken steps to move towards a circular economy, encouraging their industries to adopt circular economy practices.",India,2019.06

901,Circular economy can create 1.4 crore jobs in next 5 to 7 years: NITI Aayog CEO,"NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant threw his weight behind India developing its own circular economy ecosystem, quoting estimates to say it could generate more than one crore jobs. There are calls for circular economy to be included in the school curricula, while industry body FICCI has released a study paper on how the circular economy could work for the plastics industry. So, what exactly does this seemingly-new buzzword mean?

Circular economy, also referred to as 'circularity', is a way of managing resources so that they are used to the maximum and once the life cycle is complete, is refurbished or recycled, in whole or in part, and reused. You might say, we Indians, naturally spendthrift and value conscious, do not need to be taught this but in this case, we are referring to applying these principles on an industrial scale. This 'regenerative' approach contrasts directly with the conventional, linear model of capitalist economy, which works on the model of 'make, use and dispose.'

So why is the Indian government, NITI Aayog in particular, so excited about applying the principles of circularity on Indian economy? To start with, it is the great job factor. According to Kant, a full application of circular economy tenets to Indian manufacturing and economy could mean as much as 1.4 crore jobs in the next five to seven years. It could also spawn lakhs of small businesses, too.

Kant, who was speaking at a symposium on Circular Economy organised by FICCI in the national capital, also pointed out how the rising global population, slated to hit 9.7 billion by 2050 would have at least 3 billion people in the middle-class consumption level. “This would require 71 per cent more resources per capita, thereby raising total mineral and material demand from 50 billion tonnes in 2014 to 130 billion tonnes in 2050.”

Simply put, planet earth may simply struggle to provide resources for all that many people. The writing on the wall is clear: sustainable development and resource circularity is the need of the hour.

Kant added that if the ‘End of Life Vehicle’ policy with dated emission standards was implemented, then over 22 million vehicles will be off the road in two years time. This would include 80 per cent two-wheelers, 14 per cent cars, and 3 per cent each of three-wheelers and commercial vehicles. “End of Life Vehicles present huge business opportunity for growth, wealth creation and jobs,” he said.

From older automobiles to plastics (plastic majors came together to form an alliance against waste earlier this year) to partnerships with non-governmental organisations and environmental groups, Circular economy is slated to be a buzzword in the coming years, as businesses adapt and evolve in an age of depleting resources.",India,2019.06

915,Mini Trashpresso turns waste into beautiful products,"Making recycling ""fun and sexy"" is what Taiwanese entrepreneur Arthur Huang hopes to achieve through his mini Trashpresso - a mobile recycling plant that converts plastic waste into consumer products such as coasters and candleholders.

It is the first innovation of its kind to be showcased in Singapore and was displayed at a Recycle Right event in Toa Payoh yesterday. The Trashpresso compacts the recycling process into three steps - reducing the size of the plastic waste, purification and reshaping.

Likened in appearance to a ""candy-making machine"" by Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources Amy Khor, it can transform 135g of pellets or recycled flakes into a set of three colourful hexagon-shaped coasters in less than 10 minutes.

Speaking at the Toa Payoh HDB Hub atrium, Dr Khor said that Mr Huang's company Miniwiz has been ""innovative in converting waste materials into beautiful products"".

""If you recycle right, you can turn trash into treasure,"" she said. For instance, when used bottle caps are shredded into plastic flakes and placed into the Trashpresso, they are transformed into coasters after the three-step process.

""This will help extend the life of these materials... This is what we call a circular economy approach. Giving our waste plastic a second lease of life,"" she said.

Recycling right has taken on new urgency as the amount of waste disposed of in Singapore has, in the past 40 years, jumped seven times to 7.7 million tonnes last year - enough to fill 15,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools - and the contamination rate of the blue recycling bins is at a high 40 per cent, Dr Khor said.

Even though the country incinerates its waste, if Singaporeans continue to waste resources at the current rate, the country's only landfill at Semakau will run out of space by 2035.

To help Singapore in its efforts towards becoming a zero-waste nation, the answer may lie in decentralising the recycling process, said Mr Huang, founder and chief executive of Miniwiz, which develops recycled plastic materials for use in building construction, interior design and consumer products.

Founded in 2005, the company moved its headquarters to Singapore last November. It has an R&D centre in Taiwan, a manufacturing plant in Shenzhen, as well as an office each in Beijing and Milan, Italy.

""Four years ago, we wanted to create a machine that rewards people for recycling,"" said Mr Huang, who developed it with his team.

""The idea is to get it closer and closer to consumers. We are now in talks with many shopping malls and hotel chains in Singapore that produce a lot of trash for recycling.

""We are planning to launch the mini Trashpresso and the smart trash collecting Robin system in Shanghai in October. But there will be a mini Trashpresso set up in Singapore. We are still deciding whether we should make it automated, or let humans do the recycling.""

The Robin is a trash sorting system that allows users to track and earn points if they sort the waste correctly.

Recycling right is not difficult or time-consuming, Dr Khor said.

""First, read the labels on the blue recycling bins... and we will be changing this so it is even clearer... to find out what recyclables you can put in,"" she said. Clothes, toys, shoes and pillow cases are not recyclable.

""Second, make sure your recyclables in blue recycling bins are clean and dry. Any packaging with food or liquids will contaminate the other recyclables. This will waste the efforts of other Singaporeans who are doing their part.

""Third, you do not need to sort the materials that you put into the blue bins. We practise a co-mingled recycling system.""

Speaking at the Circular Economy Conference organized by the Delegation of the European Union to Malaysia, Yeo said pushing for change would in fact spur the local economy as new solutions were developed to cope with the problem of waste and limited resources.

""A lot of people ask me, as a small country why do we need to do all these things. Whatever we do here will leave a very little impact.

""I always answer that whenever we push for something, we are the front liner for something, we create industry and jobs and growth through that and Malaysia would like to be a leader in Southeast Asia, in the green economy and green growth,"" she said.

Yeo said the government would take a multi-pronged approach towards developing a circular economy including raising public awareness, providing financial incentives to companies and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and legislation.

However, she said the government would take steps to lead by example as it was the single largest consumer in the country and spent the greatest amount through the annual national budget.

""Government is the largest consumer so the government must lead by example. The chief secretary to the government had issued a directive to all ministries to follow the roadmap in their events and activities.

""The government spends 280 billion ringgit (67.2 billion U.S. dollars) in its annual budget every year. If we spend that in a green way, we give more opportunities for people who provide these services.

69,Across China: From trash to cash: Innovative treatment of chicken waste lays golden eggs - Xinhua | English.news.cn,"FUZHOU, June 8 (Xinhua) -- At around 7 a.m., trucks loaded with tonnes of chicken bones, heads and intestines arrive at a waste disposal plant and dump the non-edible chicken parts into an underground container through a small hole.

""It's like filling oil tanks in a gas station,"" said Jiang Haijun, general manager of the plant in Guangze County, eastern China's Fujian Province.

The waste is then pumped into a chain of cauldrons and tubes in a separate room for high-temperature sterilization, steaming and drying. Five hours later, the waste is converted into fish feed.

The plant, which is able to treat 300 tonnes of chicken waste each day, is owned by Fujian Sunner Group, one of Asia's largest chicken breeders headquartered in Guangze. The poultry giant is the supplier of chicken products for KFC and McDonald's on the Chinese mainland.

Last year, Sunner's breeding farms in Guangze produced 300 million broilers along with 60,000 tonnes of waste, which were turned into 8,000 tonnes of animal feed by the plant.

The feed was sold at up to 13,000 yuan (about 1,880 U.S. dollars) per tonne, said Jiang.

""It's an eco-friendly way to treat poultry waste, let alone the profits,"" Jiang said. ""We might risk polluting groundwater by landfill or spreading diseases by dumping untreated waste into fish ponds.""

He added that a large amount of steam and hot water generated during the processing of chicken waste is later sent back to nearby poultry slaughterhouses and used for plucking chicken feathers.

Jiang's waste disposal facility offers a glimpse into Sunner's efforts to go waste-free.

About a five minutes' drive from the facility lies a cluster of plants that dispose of chicken blood, feathers and sewage produced by Sunner's farms. One plant turns chicken blood into protein powder, while another converts chicken feathers into animal feed.

Last year, a local biomass power plant used around 28 tonnes of chicken manure from Sunner's farms to generate 163 million kilowatt hours of electricity. Most of the electricity, worth more than 100 million yuan, was provided to the State Grid.

Fu Longrun, vice director of Guangze's bureau of ecology and environment, said Sunner's model of circular economy is indicative of Guangze's efforts to make full use of solid waste and build a zero-waste city.

Enterprises in Guangze have developed techniques to convert bamboo scraps into charcoal sticks and turn construction waste into manufactured sand.

Guangze is among the 11 cities and five areas in China selected by the Chinese government last month to pilot waste-free programs. Other participating cities include Shenzhen, downtown Chongqing and Sanya in Hainan Province.

About 10 billion tonnes of solid waste are produced annually in China, according to Du Xiangwan, an academician from the Chinese Academy of Engineering.

The amount of waste, if poorly handled, will be a huge burden for the environment and a waste of resources, said Du.

""The long-term goal is to minimize solid waste production, maximize the use of trash-recycled resources and ensure safe disposal,"" Du said.",China,2019.06

For two days, there will be sustainable, conscious and interactive ‘live-in’ exhibition — a curated experience for networking and discussions on creativity, co-creation, democratic design, gender, functionality, sustainability and circular economy challenges. Invited guests will share ideas and thoughts, make connections, reflections and create new contacts in a stimulating, inspiring and thought-provoking ambience. Some of Sweden’s most popular artistes, architects and designers will be here as well. After Hrs spoke to a few of them...

Chef Marco Baudone (left) and One of his dishes

It’s the first time that Michelin Star Chef Marco Baudone is visiting India and although he says he would love to explore Mumbai, the work trip will probably have him seeing more of the kitchen than any tourist spots. The chef will be presenting some Swedish courses and products, which he wants to keep under wraps for now. “Swedish cuisine has a rather old history but it has never been sexy. Fortunately, lately a new generation of chefs have started to relaunch old traditions with a twist — in a new style and lifting up products that haven’t been so used in a while. I am bringing my own hand-picked sprouts shoots that I have pickled for a very ‘forest’ feeling and of course, a very special marinated/cured herring,” he explains.

For Idun Baltzersen, who works cross-boundary, monumental and spatial with drawing and printmaking in various forms — on paper, textile and wood, it’s the first visit to the country. “There are more people living in Mumbai than in my home country and that, I think, will be a very different experience than Scandinavia. I am also looking forward to meeting the local exhibitors at the event,” she says. Idun will be showcasing the Scandinavian tradition of using woodcut. “I work with textile and India has a long history of textile production and printing. I think there is definitively a connection there, and it would be interesting to meet Indian artists using textile and people with connections to the textile industry. I was in a group exhibition recently, with a young Indian artist called Jayeeta Chatterjee recently and found her work very inspiring,” she says.

Julius Göthlin investigates the possibilities of creating two-dimensional worlds that stays in a constant motion — a presence that has more in common with sound, air and light than with physical objects. The artist is looking to explore the vibrance, the environment and the energy of the city through the people, architecture, colours, food and social life. The aspect of Sweden that Julius finds most unique is the movement and energy found in the nature and the different seasons over here. “In the paintings I will show at Swedish Style Mumbai, there is very much an energy that is connected to the Swedish scenery and cold weather through its cold-blue tones and sharp contrasts. The paintings have been made with pigments and sand from near my studio in Stockholm, so it has a very strong connection with the landscape. My aim is to hopefully share a small and subtle slice of the energy from the Swedish landscape and scenery,” he adds.

175,Greening our cities is crucial to the future of the planet - Taipei Times,"Greening our cities is crucial to the future of the planet

As global leaders gathered in New York City for the UN Climate Action Summit last week, it was important to remember that cities are not just convenient settings for our coexistence and dialogue, but also leading sources of greenhouse-gas emissions.

As hubs of employment, trade and innovation, cities are the engines of our economic growth, accounting for more than 80 percent of global GDP. By mid-century, more than 6 billion people — almost 70 percent of the world’s population — will live in urban areas, up from about 4 billion today.

Yet cities already use more than two-thirds of the world’s resources and energy, accounting for more than 70 percent of carbon dioxide emissions. As cities continue to grow, so will these numbers. Between 2011 and 2013, China used more cement in cities development than the US did during the entire 20th century.

The future of our planet, then, depends on how we manage urban development.

In addition to being the biggest contributors to climate change, cities are also among the most at risk, and thus have the most to gain from going green.

With 90 percent of the world’s urban areas on coastlines and at risk from rising sea levels, there is significant work to be done to protect the bulk of the world’s population from these and other climate-related threats.

Cities are where spending on climate action would have the biggest impact. Making cities more compact, connected and coordinated around green policies could yield economic savings of up to US$17 trillion by 2050.

For starters, we must do far more to reduce energy consumption, harmful emissions and air pollution, not least by improving energy efficiency in urban areas.

Given that urban infrastructure is hard to change quickly (and lasts a long time), the time for a new conversation about urbanization is now.

Cities need to develop plans to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, build resilience and involve all relevant sectors of the economy in the shift toward clean energy. Policymakers should be planning for adaptations to existing infrastructure and new long-term investments.

Many cities around the world are already integrating climate goals into their urban-development plans. Copenhagen has emphasized increasing its buildings’ energy efficiency. Bangalore is investing in sustainable transport, and, among other good examples, Mexico City is focused on strengthening the resilience of its most vulnerable residents to extreme weather events.

A growing number of cities have come to realize that climate-friendly policies have immediate benefits in terms of both quality of life and economic growth.

Green investment makes economic sense, because it tends to result in better municipal services, cleaner air and safer water. Indeed, solar energy is now often cheaper than fossil fuels, and plastic recycling — a key to cleaning up our oceans — is a source of steady jobs.

However, cities also need to go further, by recognizing the benefits of a circular economy that minimizes waste.

“The 15 circular steps for cities,” a guide from the European Investment Bank (EIB), shows that cities and their residents have much to gain — including a smaller carbon footprint — from reduced consumption and reuse of resources.

Around the world, international development banks are providing cities with financing and technical assistance for climate-related projects.

For the EIB, the priorities are energy efficiency, renewables, and sustainable transport.

At the same time, governments need to introduce new regulations and offer bigger incentives to get projects off the ground, and to encourage more innovation among businesses.

To that end, we need all stakeholders to be connected and on the same page. City networks such as C40 Cities, Local Governments for Sustainability (better known as ICLEI) and the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy offer a good starting point.

These groups have the power and influence to get the right people around the same table, discussing concrete policies.

For its part, the EIB and the Global Covenant of Mayors have joined forces to help cities finance climate action and build greener cities for future generations.

Under this new partnership, we launched the Global Climate City Challenge a year ago to provide technical assistance that helps prepare and fast-track the financing of urban climate action projects.

After soliciting 145 climate-policy ideas from more than 100 cities around the world, we have selected 20 proposals involving a total investment potential of 1.4 billion euros (US$1.53 billion).

By extending technical assistance and financing for climate projects to cities in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the EU, the program will create jobs, cut energy bills, improve air quality, strengthen the management of waste and wastewater, and build resilience.

To address the critical lack of grant funding necessary to advance projects to a stage where they are ready for feasibility analysis and ultimately investment, the City Climate Finance Gap Fund was launched during the UN Climate Action Summit. It aims to raise more than 100 million euros in grants in order to unlock at least 4 billion euros in projects.

Government and financial leaders who met in New York City should bear in mind that they are not alone. They have the support of a growing global community of mayors, local officials and private-sector leaders who are determined to usher in greener cities for all citizens. Our task is to ensure that these voices are heard.

271,Citizens brainstorm ideas to spur recycling,"From education campaigns to spot checks on recycling bins and refundable deposits for items such as glass bottles, suggestions on how to improve Singapore's dismal household recycling rate came fast and furious yesterday.

Forty-eight people gathered at the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) for a citizens' work group aimed at getting ideas on how to improve the way households recycle.

Participants of the Recycle Right work group came from various backgrounds and included those who do not recycle regularly.

One of the participants was Mr Leon Traazil, 42, a marketing director. He told The Sunday Times that a targeted media campaign was needed to improve domestic recycling rate.

""Right now, the media scene is very fragmented, and news is often very scattered,"" said Mr Traazil.

""I think better communication and education on how to recycle right is needed,"" he added.

""A campaign to reinforce this message on multiple platforms, even traditional means like fliers in letter boxes, can reach out to more people.""

Singapore's domestic recycling rate has fared poorly over the years, hovering around 20 per cent. Last year, households generated about two million tonnes of waste and only 22 per cent of it was recycled.

One key reason for the low rate is contamination.

Statistics from the National Environment Agency show that 40 per cent of the items deposited inside the blue recycling bins do not get recycled because they are either non-recyclable or are recyclables that have been soiled by food and liquid waste.

Participants said the contamination could be due to convenience or ignorance.

Marketing executive Zena Yong, 26, said: ""Sometimes people may not recycle because they don't know whether their efforts matter. Others may throw food waste into the bin, or public waste collectors may mix recyclables with general trash, and these will compromise all their efforts.""

To tackle this, said Ms Cheong Kai Yuan, a fresh graduate from the National University of Singapore, the authorities can do spot checks on recycling bins, and if contamination is detected, paste a notice nearby highlighting the contamination.

""This would send the signal that someone is watching, and that people should take more effort to recycle right,"" said Ms Cheong, 23.

While suggestions to introduce incentives to encourage people to recycle more were also thrown up, participants said this could do more harm than good.

Said Mr Traazil: "" If people are incentivised to do so, they may stop when the incentives stop.""

The work group is the latest in a slew of governmental initiatives to reduce Singapore's growing mountain of trash.

In August, MEWR rolled out Singapore's first zero-waste masterplan. This highlighted a target of sending about one-third, or 30 per cent, less waste to the Semakau Landfill by 2030. This is to help the Republic's one and only offshore landfill last longer than the projected 2035.

Aiding this target, the Resource Sustainability Bill was passed in Parliament earlier this month to give the authorities regulatory teeth to compel large waste producers to reuse and recycle more.

It will also pave the way for Singapore to squeeze more value out of every bit of waste.

This could happen through turning incineration ash into construction material, extracting gold and precious metals from discarded electronics, and producing energy from food waste.

Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources Amy Khor, who was at yesterday's event, said recycling is not just good for the environment, but could also benefit the economy.

Preliminary studies have estimated that a net benefit of $40 million could be reaped if Singapore recovers and reuses materials from electronic waste.

Said Dr Khor: ""If we can improve the way we recycle, we can keep our finite resources in use for as long as possible. By turning trash into treasure, we can close our waste loop and move towards a circular economy approach to resource management.""",Singapore,2019.09
274,Javadekar reaffirms India’s want to grow ‘sustainably’,"India will grow sustainably and at the same time ensure its citizens get the benefits of development, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar told a United Nations forum here.

Speaking at the ‘setting the context for the industry transition’ programme at the Climate Action Summit here on Saturday, Javadekar underscored Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Zero Defect Zero Effect’ model where no products have defects and their production has no adverse effects on the environment.

“My country is on (a) growth trajectory. I can’t deny justice to my people (of wanting to develop). We want to grow sustainably,” Javadekar said.

The Climate Action Summit here, hosted by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, aims to boost action to implement the 2016 Paris Agreement. It will focus on nine interdependent tracks, which will be led by 19 countries and aided by international organisations.

The coalition on transforming industry is being led by India and Sweden.

Javadekar said the nine tracks will help nations in efforts to achieve the goals set under the Paris Agreement.

The minister told the forum that carbon capture and storing has been discussed for years, but it has not fructified to the extent it should have.

He said in a first a campus is coming up in India which will capture carbon. “There will be carbon emission which will be trapped and used as raw material in other factories. That is a big thing,” he said.

Javadekar elaborated on India’s six-dollar-a-ton carbon tax, calling it a carrot and stick policy.

“So the industry starts thinking in the way of how we can avoid coal consumption and how we can come up with other solutions,” he said, adding India is probably the only country with such a policy.

The minister said the lowest carbon emission cement industry is in India.

He lauded the improvements made in India’s cement sector, especially in process technologies, more efficient raw material blending, high efficiency classified files, improved process control and management systems, better raw material selection.

He said the Indian aviation industry was fast switching to biofuels.

“Our first successful flight from Dehradun to Delhi flew on biofuel ethanol. We are making more progress in that direction,” he said.

The minister said now plans were afoot to fly Boeing planes with biofuel and “we will succeed I’m very sure”.

Javadekar said energy intensity (the measure of energy inefficiency) in the country has been brought down and that the results were for all to see.

Later, he elaborated on the national policy of resource efficiency and circular economy concept.

He said there is tremendous push by the Indian government on e-mobility and is giving related tax concessions.

He said Euro 6 compliant vehicles will be in the market by April 2020.

“It’s a huge investment in fuel. So, we are moving around with really ambitious targets. And we are on the road,” he said.

Use of better quality inputs have resulted in gradual reduction of energy consumption in the steel sector as well, he said.

He said the government’s 'Perform, Achieve and Trade' initiative has covered 478 energy intensive industries.

The minister said many Indian industries are part of the carbon disclosure project and have begun adopting science-based targets.

He said these examples of public policy intervention and public private partnerships have been successful in reducing emission of Indian industries.

“However, efforts need to be scaled up because the challenge is global and large,” he said.

Javadekar stressed that many countries have profited through historical emissions and these nations must now take more responsibility to address the climate challenges.

In this regard, he suggested technological and financial solutions. On technology, he said there will always be new innovations coming up which will reduce energy intensity and raise efficiency and these technologies need to be made available.

“All these measures have very important critical elements. And if government is supporting innovation, the society is supporting innovation, the innovation will not be bogged down in intellectual property rights, but will be available to the world because we are mitigating a disaster,” he said.

He further stressed there should not be a case of profiteering as motive in the case of technology transfer for tackling climate change.

“And so my submission is that if we really want to achieve (our targets), we have to address these two important issues because the world is suffering.”

On products which are produced through environmentally-friendly means but are more expensive than their environmentally-degrading substitutes, Javadekar said,”The world has seen that organic food and vegetables fetch more price. Why can’t industrial products do that? If we address all these issues...we will come out with certain different solutions.”

India and Sweden are co-leading an industry transition track under the high-level UN Climate Action Summit, hosted by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, that will create stronger commitments from sectors such as steel and cement to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

With a view to boosting ambition and accelerating action to implement the Paris Agreement, the Climate Action Summit will focus on nine interdependent tracks, which will be led by 19 countries in total and supported by international organisations.

The nine tracks are mitigation, social and political drivers, youth and public mobilisation, energy transition, industry transition, infrastructure, cities and local action, nature-based solutions, resilience and adaptation, climate finance and carbon pricing.

“The collaboration between India, Sweden, the World Economic Forum and many others to kick this process off is leadership by example and I look forward to seeing how this develops over the coming years,” Amina Mohammed, UN

Deputy Secretary General, said while addressing the ‘Setting the context for the industry transition programme’ for the Climate Action Summit here Saturday.

India and Sweden are co-leading the Industry Transition track, which will focus on creating stronger commitments from the “hard-to-abate sectors” such as steel, cement and build on positive momentum in areas such as shipping. It is supported by the World Economic Forum (WEF).

Other stakeholders in the industry track are The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), World Bank, Confederation of Indian Industry, Confederation of Swedish Enterprise and International Chamber of Commerce.

Among the expected outcome from the track is announcements from at least 6-7 CEOs from heavy industry and transport (i.e. chemicals, cement, steel, aluminium, trucking, shipping, aviation), across different geographies, making commitments to net-zero emissions by 2050 with a clear plan on how this will be achieved and a clear near-term deliverable.

339,Bioplastics: Leading the Way to a Better World,"Bioplastics: Leading the Way to a Better World

The World Economic Forum recently revealed the top 10 emerging technologies for 2019 that are expected to radically impact the global social and economic order. Top on the list is Bioplastics for a Circular Economy.

Less than 15% of the world’s plastic is recycled, with the rest incinerated, abandoned or sent to landfill. Biodegradable plastic offers a solution. The technology certainly benefits the circular economy.

In Thailand, a chemical company, PTT Global Chemical (GC) continues to drive sustainable growth in line with the concept of Circular Economy, both internally and externally. The company is also building social awareness that will lead to changing behaviour regarding the more efficient use of resources which will, in turn, enable GC to reach its goal of becoming a model of sustainability.

GC is also committed to conducting its operations with an emphasis on resource efficiency and environmental conservation, as a foundation for sustainable operations, more efficient manufacturing processes, lower consumption, improved waste management, and reduced environmental impact. This involves applying circular economy principles to technological and biochemical improvements to reduce waste and environmental impacts throughout GC's supply chain.

GC operates its business by applying circular economy principles both inside and outside the company, while at the same time increasing public awareness with a goal of changing behaviour to maximise the value of resources. A priority for GC is to become a role model of encouraging circular economy-led lifestyles known as the “Circular Living Concept”.

GC's sustainable management practices cover four areas: resource management from upstream to downstream; production management using the ""3Rs"" (Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle), which expands into ""5Rs"" (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Refuse, and Renewables); efficient consumption; and effective waste management. Another area of focus for GC is upcycling – applying innovations and creativity to add more value to products. This is also in line with the principles of the circular economy.

GC focuses on bioplastics used to produce packaging in various forms. GC is the major shareholder in NatureWorks, the world’s largest producer of PLA (Polylactic Acid), headquartered in the USA. GC has a 50% share in PTTMCC Biochem, the leader in BioPBS (Bio Polybutylene Succinate). PLA and bioPBS are bioplastics widely used for sustainable products globally. Bioplastics are plastics derived from natural raw materials. They have similar properties as conventional plastics but can be composted into carbon dioxide, water, and biomass that can be used for crops and other plants or for feedstock as part of circular economy. Bio-based bioplastics are produced by fermentation that converts natural raw materials like sugar into monomer which is polymerized into bioplastic resin. Bioplastics have been successfully developed on a commercial scale worldwide. They include Polylactic Acid (PLA) and Biopolybutylene Succinate (BioPBS.Bioplastics), compostable materials that take six months to one year to decompose under appropriate conditions.

GC works on bioplastics projects with various partners, including Benjarong BioPBS Coated Cup, Chulalongkorn University’s Zero Waste Cup, and Silpakorn University’s Be Smart Be Green Bioplastic straws. All aim to introduce environment-friendly products for sustainable lifestyles.

The latest initiative from the company is “GC Compostable Label”. GC has created labels certifying the products and packaging produced from compostable bioplastic pellets by GC group. This shows the intention to develop environment-friendly products, build confidence, and give assurance to consumers that the products they use are fully compostable and good for the environment, all in accordance with strict circular economy principles.",Thailand,2019.09
379,"Singapore Poly, JTC ink deal to spur tech adoption","As Singapore forges ahead in building a new hub for advanced manufacturing in Jurong West, JTC Corporation and Singapore Polytechnic (SP) joined hands yesterday to ensure a pipeline of skilled workers for the sector.

SP is set to work with industry players to develop and provide technology solutions, as well as conduct workforce training for companies. It will also help firms redesign operations and drive technology adoption.

SP will introduce work-study programmes for students, entry-level professionals and employees as well with support from JTC, in line with a memorandum of understanding signed at the launch of an exhibition on the upcoming 600ha Jurong Innovation District.

In turn, SP students will be given internship and project opportunities at advanced manufacturing companies including those in the new district, which will be developed by JTC over the next two decades. Over 400 students from SP are expected to benefit from this programme in the next three years, said JTC.

It added that ""this complements the suite of upcoming research and training opportunities"" in Jurong Innovation District.

They include programmes on the applications of Industry 4.0 methods and technologies by German engineering firm Bosch Rexroth at its regional training centre, and the NTU-JTC Industry Talent Development Programme, where students intern and work on projects with advanced manufacturing industry partners.

""The global digital transformation in manufacturing will require a new generation to work alongside new technologies in a digitalised workplace,"" said JTC chief executive Ng Lang. ""Partnerships with institutes of higher learning like SP are important in ensuring that our workforce is equipped with the right skillsets to meet the needs of new manufacturing jobs.""

Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who was at the event, said the masterplan for the innovation district is important for Singapore. It is part of the next phase in development for advanced manufacturing - which refers to the inclusion of new technology and improved processes in manufacturing - in the economy.

""Once we fully develop the Jurong Innovation District, we expect about 95,000 new jobs to be created. New jobs in clean, advanced facilities that offer very good career prospects,"" said Mr Tharman, who is also Coordinating Minister for Social Policies.

He said he hopes the district, which will ""have a strong sustainability slant"" in its design, can be an example of how manufacturing and industry are able to help further the circular economy.

The district will be linked to its wider residential environment. Its features include Singapore's first 11km car-free ""sky corridor"" with dedicated lanes for pedestrians, cyclists and autonomous shuttles. It will also boast a 10ha park in Bulim precinct, to be built in phases from 2020. Bulim is one of several areas in the district, which includes Tengah, Bahar, CleanTech Park and Nanyang Technological University.

The existing Jurong Eco-Garden will get a facelift as well, with nature trails, a cafe, playground and fitness facilities by 2025, said JTC.",Singapore,2019.09
382,Saturday Indesign Ambassador Tan Szue Hann | Indesignlive.sg,"Our Ambassadors for Saturday Indesign 2019 are at the forefront of the industry. Find out what makes them tick in our profile series. First up is architect Tan Szue Hann – the Managing Director of MINIWIZ Singapore.

MINIWIZ is a circular economy RD&D [Research, Design & Development] company that turns waste materials into architecture, interiors, furniture, products, fashion and anything else that is worthwhile and meaningful.

The great thing about what MINIWIZ produces is that sustainability credentials are matched by visual appeal. The company’s Polli-Ber Brick is the perfect example. This modular interlocking brick made with recycled plastic and agricultural waste is so beautiful that it will serve as the trophy for the winning team in our Saturday Indesign 2019 Debate!

Since Hann joined the company and established its Singapore office earlier this year, he has been busy not only spreading awareness of the MINIWIZ catalogue of modular building materials, furniture and objects, but also working with government to push toward circular economy initiatives.

We sat down on some of MINIWIZ’s own furniture (incorporating recycled materials, of course) for a chat about Hann’s goals for a more sustainable Singapore, and the kinds of solutions MINIWIZ can offer designers and their clients.

What is the key message you’d like people to understand about MINIWIZ and what it does?

We can really use design to elevate the value of materials. A lot of what we do at MINIWIZ is applying design and engineering so that people appreciate the value of what’s been recycled. A lot of people look at recycled goods and think, “Hey, that used to be someone else’s.” And in our culture, in Asia, sometimes there’s a bit of stigma to that. But if we re-engineer, re-design and almost make it unrecognisable, then that allows for the material to gain a new perceived value.

But what we do is not just about perception or how something looks, but also how it performs. A new composite or a newly engineered material can often perform better than it originally could have.

Could you give us some examples?

For example, our Polli-Ber Brick – which will be the Saturday Indesign Debate trophy – is a composite of polystyrene, which is otherwise very brittle, and rice husks from agricultural waste. Combining those in a certain proportion makes the plastic a lot less brittle. The rice husks also bring a new aesthetic quality to the material. And that also empirically improves its value.

In what contexts are people specifying the Polli-Ber Brick? 



We’ve supplied it for the backdrop of a stage set, it’s been made into feature walls (including architectural offices), and of course it’s the entrance wall at our MINIWIZ Singapore office as well. So far it’s been used in a decorative way and as partition walls, but we have also engineered a material that can also be used for exterior walls. It’s similar to Polli-Ber Brick, but we fill the cavity with concrete so it becomes fireproof as well.

What sort of product inventory does MINIWIZ keep, and how can your products be ordered?

We work on a solutions-based model. What that means is we try to customise solutions for architects, for developers, for homeowners or whoever it is. We don’t carry a huge inventory of our products. The model is more like – what kind of space do you have? What sort of products or combinations thereof could actually make sense for what you require? So it could be partially bricks, it could be partially plastic felt wall panels – depending on what you need to do with the space and how it needs to perform. We can also start introducing furniture that’s made of recycled waste. So it’s a combination of all these things.

Therefore we don’t have an exact inventory from which you can pick and choose. We customise for you and we start making the production orders accordingly. So every product is customised, even though the building blocks are the same.

The production is currently primarily based in Taiwan [where the MINIWIZ headquarters are located], although we are in talks of bringing it closer to the SEA region to mitigate carbon footprint. We also have portable machines for producing our wall tiles and our smaller items, so we can manufacture those on site, anywhere in the world.

How and why are you working with government here in Singapore? What are you hoping to achieve?

Working with the government is crucial because we need a whole culture where the circular economy is the established norm. Right now we’re not there. We need to get the framework and policy in place such that recycling becomes a way of life, and we’re sorting out our own waste before it goes into the dump. When recyclable materials are already sorted out and fairly clean, then the re-engineering and production of materials can begin.

Without those kinds of policies, people are just going to continue throwing things away the same way they have in the past. When it comes to consumers, there’s a lot of wanton throwing away of things that are only used once or twice. That’s not good enough for the sustainable nation we want to be. We need to start developing a culture that appreciates the multiple uses of materials and the constant renewal of goods into different things. That’s how we can begin to establish a circular economy.

“We need to start developing a culture that appreciates the multiple uses of materials and the constant renewal of goods into different things.”

That doesn’t mean that we cut off the consumer chain entirely, or that we are anti-consumerist. We’re not obviously, because you need growth to happen. But if we start thinking about building new things with what we currently have, without expending more carbon to generate brand new materials, that’s the beginning of closing that loop.

Perhaps one of the factors leading to Singapore’s lack of recycling culture is the domestic rubbish chute. Do you agree?

I’ll pull the lens a bit further back. The main problem related to the lack of recycling is the whole culture of efficiency. We’re obsessed with being efficient and with hygiene. There are multiple instances where single-use plastics are extremely necessary – primarily in the medical field. But I think it’s also about what is sensible. There’s a fine balance to keep between what is convenient and what is considerate.

What did you enjoy at past editions of Saturday Indesign, and what are you looking forward to this year?

Saturday Indesign is a confluence of the exciting new design products that are out there, and the key players in the industry – all within one day, and within a curated set of spaces. To have Indesign curate an event and have the entire community come down and engage in discourse and conversations about design – and of course the debate! – that’s a red-letter calendar event that everyone can look forward to. And I imagine it will only keep growing.

The buzz is not just the event, but also its combination with what’s out there on the web. The ecosystem that creates has become even stronger than in previous years. I’m really proud to be an Ambassador for Saturday Indesign and I’m looking forward to 12 October!

Thanks to MINIWIZ for being the Saturday Indesign 2019 Trophy Partner!

441,FMCG companies chase stiff deadlines to cut plastic use,"While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a deadline of October 2, 2019, for eradication of single-use plastic, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are working aggressively towards meeting their timelines of using 100% biodegradable plastic for packaging ready-to-eat products.

A lot of initiatives have been put in place to reduce, collect and recycle multi-layered plastic (MLP). Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles used for beverage products are being re-purposed to make apparels, footwear, furniture, etc, by many companies.

Sharukh Khan, executive director - operations, Dabur India, said the company is aiming to become a plastic waste neutral company by March 2021. “This is being done by collecting, processing and recycling 20,000 metric tonnes (mt) of post-consumer plastic waste. With this, the company would be collecting 100% of the plastic waste it generates through its product packaging,” said Khan.

However, players say a clear definition of what is single-use plastic in the Indian context is very crucial. According to industry players, items like plastic carry bags, plates, glasses, cups, cutlery, straws and take-away food containers and thermocol plates fall in this category.

They said the problem can largely be solved by embedding the concept of 5R – refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle and recover.

“It starts with educating consumers to avoid plastic use, if possible. The crucial step in achieving recycling or recovery is an effective source segregation. The challenge is mainly in terms of lack of the required infrastructure. The regulators should focus on systems for effective collection, recycle and recovery. A suitable extended producer responsibility (EPR) framework involving all the relevant stakeholders will help. We have allocated Rs 3.25 crore for EPR this year along with a lot of management time and attention. We have set our packaging targets for 2024-25. For our India operations, we will reduce packaging consumption per unit of production by 20% from 2017-18. We will also ensure that 100% of the packaging material we use is recyclable, reusable, recoverable or compostable,” said Rakesh Sinha, head - global supply chain, manufacturing and IT, Godrej Consumer Products Ltd.

PepsiCo India has been been working across states to collect, segregate and sustainably manage equivalent of 100% plastic packaging by 2021. It has partnered with organisations to upcycle plastic into creating utility products such as chairs, benches, tables, t-shirts, laptop bags -- for instance, six PET bottles are being used to make a t-shirt. “One of our key targets is to make 100% recyclable, compostable or biodegradable packaging by 2025 and we have been striving to design all packaging with the goal to achieve optimum results with utmost efficient use of material possible,” a PepsiCo India spokesperson said.

Hindustan Unilever (HUL) will move to 100% reusable, recyclable or compostable plastic packaging by 2025. The company is working with the government and other partners such as United Nations Development Programme on pilot projects for plastic waste management.

“We have also committed that 25% of all the plastic we use will come from recycled sources by 2025. We are working towards achieving this goal. We continually look at new ways to reduce, re-use, recycle and recover packaging and waste as we move towards becoming a zero-waste business. Globally, we have reduced nearly one-third of our packaging waste since 2010. We are committed to accelerating a transition to a circular economy, moving from the linear take-make-dispose model to a regenerative approach, which keeps materials at their highest value for as long as possible,” said an HUL spokesperson.

ITC has been adopting a holistic approach based on packaging optimisation, use of polymers that allow higher levels of recycling and supporting municipal programmes on waste source segregation, collection, reuse and recycling.

“Over 150 mt of post-consumer MLP was collected in Pune in partnership with a pioneering waste-pickers cooperative SWaCH and recycled as vegetable trays, flower pots, pallets, etc. Since its launch in June 2019, this programme is in the process of being scaled up to achieve an annual recycling target of 2,500 mt, ITC said.

Nestlé India's plans to 100% recyclable/ reusable packaging by 2025. It has designed a project called '2 minute Safaai ke naam' in Dehradun and Mussoorie in November 2018, wherein consumers were incentivised by giving them a packet of Maggi noodle for every 10 empty packets.

“We are working on developing more environment-friendly packaging materials. For single-use plastics at our out of home outlets, we are exploring alternative options. There are certain challenges in serving hot beverages in 100% paper-based options and we are trying to address that,” said a Nestlé India spokesperson.

Coca-Cola's primary packaging is completely recyclable and does not consist of single-use plastic, it said. While continuing with sustainable packaging initiatives, it is redesigning and light-weighting packaging, increasing renewable and recycled material use supporting recycling programmes.",Singapore,2019.09
447,Fortum India signs a MoU with CCS Haryana Agricultural University to make fiber from paddy straw,"Hisar: Fortum India, a Finnish clean energy company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar, a State University with the objective to establish collaboration in research about paddy and paddy straw.

The MoU was signed in the presence of Prof. K.P. Singh, Vice Chancellor, CCS Haryana Agricultural University by Mr. Sanjay Aggarwal, Managing Director, Fortum India Pvt Ltd. And Dr. S.K. Sehrawat, Director of Research, CCS Haryana Agriculture University, Hisar.

Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural University has been constantly working towards the management of paddy straw and as a first step, Fortum’s partnership with HAU will include to deepen understanding of the theoretical and practical knowledge and expertise in the areas of studying the properties of rice straw and other agri-biomass, its availability, socio economic impact, probable supply chain and other possible area of support, in the State of Haryana.

Prof. K.P. Singh, Vice Chancellor, HAU, while expressing his thoughts over the MoU, said, “This will give more thrust to the university’s crop residue management program. The university is striving not only for the proper management of crop residues but also for the fair value of everything coming out of the farm.”

“At the university, we are establishing an Innovation Centre for Agri waste Management (ICAWM). ICAWM aims to identify, synergistically develop and propagate circular economy based innovative technologies for conversion of crop residue into eco- friendly, technically efficient and economically viable Bio-waste value added products. We hope together we can find holistic solutions which will help in uplifting the farmer’s lives.” he added.

It is noteworthy that there is a serious problem of managing paddy straw in the states of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Some farmers burn crop residues and destroy them, causing environmental pollution. To protect the environment and to provide simple and economical options for the farmers to manage paddy straw, Haryana Agricultural University is working seriously under the guidance of Prof. K.P. Singh.

Commenting on the same, Mr. Sanjay Aggarwal, Managing Director of Fortum India Private Limited said, “We are proud to collaborate with Haryana Agricultural University, one of the leading universities of the country to solve the problem of paddy straw in Haryana. Burning of crop residues on a large scale in the fields emits greenhouse gas which has huge side effects on the environment. In three states in the Delhi region, 50 million tonnes of agrobiomass is burned every year. We intend to convert this agricultural waste into valuable products, provide solutions to reduce pollution, which will help local communities to become self-sufficient and raise their standard of living.”

“We will work with the university to make textile fiber from paddy straw, as well as other valuable chemicals which are used in many industries, to make bioplastics and to establish bio refinery in the future.”, he further added.

Mr. Faizur Rahman, Head, Bio2X & Legal, Fortum India Private Limited, said, “Fortum has established a joint venture together with Numaligarh Refinery Limited (NRL) for building and operating a biorefinery in Assam, India with an investment of INR 1260 crore wherein, bioethanol, furfural, acidic acid and electricity are produced from Bamboo.”

460,SCG enlists Dow in recycling plan,"Siam Cement Group (SCG) has teamed up with US materials science company Dow to conduct a feasibility study of plastic waste recycling and renewable feedstock operations in the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC).

Roongrote Rangsiyopash, SCG's president and chief executive, said the study will be concluded by December, after which both parties will outline the facility size and investment budget.

""This collaboration expects to operate mechanical and feedstock recycling from plastic resins, plastic waste and petrochemical feedstocks,"" he said. ""It is a business opportunity for SCG and Dow to embrace the circular economy concept, bringing practical solutions for recycling and upcycling of plastic waste to Thailand.""

SCG is also calling on the government to offer investment privileges for the circular economy because many companies are investing heavily in the concept.

""The privileges will attract investors to enter this scheme with many projects such as waste separation facilities,"" Mr Roongrote said.

He said both firms plan to expand their recycling operations beyond EEC provinces, but any move will depend on the volume of plastic waste circulated in the recycling facilities of each province.

Jim Fitterling, Dow's chief executive, said the company can provide its recycling technologies to support future operations in Thailand.

The collaboration with SCG is an example of Dow's strategy of enabling a shift to the circular economy for plastics by focusing on resource efficiency and integrating recycled content and renewable feedstocks into production processes.

Moreover, post-consumer plastics can become higher-value products through their extended lifespan.

Mr Fitterling said the plastic waste circulating in the oceans amounts to about 8 million tonnes worldwide. Thailand alone is responsible for some 1 million tonnes a year entering the seas.

""Dow expects that plastic waste locally can be recycled for this operation at roughly 200,000-300,000 tonnes per year in the near future,"" Mr Fitterling said.

Dow and SCG will study the possibilities for waste separation in the country. The study is expected to determine which types of waste plastic are suitable for waste separation and the best solution for a recycling system.

""Plastic waste recycling and renewable feedstock operations can start on a commercial scale of roughly 20,000-30,000 tonnes per year,"" Mr Fitterling said. ""The plastics are too valuable to be lost as waste, so they should be a part of the circular economy concept.""",Thailand,2019.09

505,WBCSD and Circular IQ partner to scale up the circular economy uptake by business,"Geneva, Amsterdam, 02 September 2019 - The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and Circular IQ today announced their partnership agreement to co-develop an online tool in support of the Circular Transition Indicators (CTI)-framework developed by WBCSD over the past year. The framework, which has been pilot tested by 15 leading companies, aims to help businesses calculate, measure and monitor their progress in the circular economy with to scale up impact and improve strategic decision making.

Continued extraction of finite resources, climate and demographic changes will make it harder for businesses to provide the products and services necessary for a well-functioning global circular economy. And today the global economy is only 9 per cent circular, which means that the pressure to accelerate the transition to a circular economy is growing. Successful circular initiatives will reduce dependence on dwindling natural resources and will create value for companies and their stakeholders.

“We look forward to collaborating with Circular IQ, an emerging innovator in the field of circular economy data-collection and reporting”, said Brendan Edgerton, WBCSD’s Director for Circular Economy of WBCSD. “Our partnership will deliver a unique tool that will help many business measure and track progress on their circularity building more momentum and business action to move to the circular economy and deliver the solutions needed to build a sustainable world.”

“Our experience in collecting and digitising existing data and using this data to improve decision-making, helps businesses to act and measure results”, said Roy Vercoulen, CEO and co-founder of Circular IQ. “I am very excited with this partnership. I believe our experience will help WBCSD to create tools, to support and empower companies to initiate actions to assess their circularity and start improving it.”

Jeff Turner, Vice President Sustainability at DSM, the chair of the CTI development project in the WBCSD working group, said “For DSM as a purpose -driven company that focuses on circular solutions, it is important that we can measure our circularity through a commonly agreed framework by the business community. This tool will not only help companies individually in collecting data and performing the calculations, it also ensures consistent outcomes for any company that chooses to use it and therefore increases the robustness of the CTI framework.”

Moving forward, consistent measurement metrics to assess circularity will be key. Circular IQ, and WBCSD are strongly aligned on the belief that our society faces major and global challenges regarding waste, pollution, resource depletion and global warming. Action and smart tooling are needed to effectively tackle these problems. The CTI-framework will help companies identify opportunities to improve their circularity and effectively address these challenges.

The two organisations are aligned in purpose, knowledge and expertise and look forward to starting their collaboration to bring the online tool for the CTI framework to life to provide companies across geographies and sectors with a tool that allows them to calculate, measure and monitor their transition to a circular economy.

The online tool will officially be launched at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in January 2020.",Singapore,2019.09

36,Will Indian Cities Start Paying for Bus Tickets With Plastic Bottles? Quite Possible!,"We live in a world which is mostly concentrated on make, use, and dispose. This, loosely referred to as linear economy, ensures that we walk towards an impending mass destruction of the planet where the natural habitats would be choking with plastic and other toxic industrial waste very soon.

However, all may not be lost after all. While many organisations follow the destructive path of a linear economy, growing awareness regarding the environment has led to the development of a concept called 'circular economy'.

Broadly speaking, a 'circular economy' model ensures that Earth's continually repleting natural resources are put to minimal use to sustain them for future generations It is not only limited to daily-use recycling products but goes deeper by attempting to ensure that organisations recreate products which can make their recycling easier or unnecessary. This model of economy would not only ensure less consumption of non-renewable resources but ensure their sustainability for future generations.

On Wednesday, Chairman of the Mahindra group, Anand Mahindra shared a video from the World Economic Forum which detailed the accounts of four cities that let the public pay for public transport with plastic waste.

Beijing allows commuters to pay for the metro ticket with plastic bottles at a special ticket machine. In an Indonesian city, buses accept payment through plastic bottles and not cash. In Surabaya, again in Indonesia, passengers pay with recycling and get two hours of travel. In Istanbul, meanwhile, people can exchange their plastic waste for credit on their metro cards which can be used on different forms of public transport. Sydney has high-tech reverse vending machines where recycling gets you rewards like movie tickets or bus tickets.

Talking about recycling laying the foundation for a circular economy, Mahindra wondered which Indian city would be the first to take a similar initiative, tagging Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Andhra Pradesh CM N. Chandrababu Naidu, asking them whether they would implement this model in Indore and Amravati respectively.



Thanking the chairman for his suggestion, CM Shivraj informed that the state of Madhya Pradesh does have several plastic bottle recycling machines, however, his (Mahindra) suggestion was a good idea and the CM promised to take this up in a future meeting.

Several other users too hailed the idea and even offered their suggestions.",India,2018.09
61,"Interview: China, EU's interests have been closely intertwined: ambassador - Xinhua | English.news.cn","BRUSSELS, Dec. 29 (Xinhua) -- Despite some ""growing pains"", the relations between China and the European Union (EU) have made important progress in 2018, and the interests of the two sides have been closely intertwined, Ambassador Zhang Ming, head of the Chinese Mission to the EU, told Xinhua in a recent exclusive interview.

In the year of 2018, which marks the 15th anniversary of the establishment of the China-EU Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, the relations between the two sides have maintained a steady growth momentum, with scope of cooperation being expanded and interests further integrated, among others, Zhang said.

In the past year, the 20th China-EU leaders' meeting was successfully held. Leaders of many European countries, including Britain, France and Germany, together with about 10 commissioners of the European Commission and more than 50 members of the European Parliament have visited China.

""Such frequent high-level exchanges have enhanced mutual trust and injected new political impetus into the development of China-EU relations,"" Zhang noted.

In the economic and trade sector, bilateral trade volume has grown rapidly to a new height this year. The two sides also exchanged offers of bilateral investment treaty, agreed to end the negotiation of the Agreement on Geographical Indications in a timely manner, and signed new cooperation agreements on circular economy, blue partnership and customs cooperation.

China-EU relations are bearing more significance on the global level, Zhang added. ""China and the EU have more common words in supporting multilateralism and improving global governance; They also issued a joint statement on climate change while maintaining close communication on such global and regional hot issues as the Iranian nuclear and Syria.""

In addition, China and the EU have deepened their cooperation on the Belt and Road initiative, Zhang said. With a growing positive voice within the Union, the EU's recognition and understanding of the initiative are more objective thanks to their deepened political consensus and more fruitful cooperation.

During the 20th China-EU leaders' meeting and the 12th Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) summit, China and the EU reached important consensus on synergizing connectivity between the Belt and Road initiative and the EU Strategy on Connecting Europe and Asia. Many Chinese and European companies have cooperated in third-party markets including Asia and Africa to carry out major projects in infrastructure, energy, environmental protection and finance.

The pragmatic results of China and the EU in 2018 are inseparable from the positive attitude of the EU in developing cooperation with China. The EU's objective voice toward China is rising. And with a greater expectation, the EU is more active in making strategic plan for the development of bilateral relations, Zhang noted.

""China appreciates the EU's positive stance on developing bilateral relations and is willing to meet the EU halfway, hoping that the Union could match its words to deeds, respect China's core interests and major concerns, and develop bilateral relations in a fair, equitable, open and win-win manner,"" Zhang said.

Meanwhile, the year 2019 is important to both sides as it marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the European Parliament election.

""Amid rising protectionism and unilateralism on the global arena, China and the EU have a greater responsibility to promote bilateral relations, enhance mutually beneficial cooperation for the good of the two peoples while continuously adhering to multilateralism, so as to deal with the uncertainty of the global situation with stable bilateral relations,"" said the ambassador.

""The interests of China and the EU have been closely intertwined, but the potential for cooperation needs to be further explored,"" Zhang said.

For now, EU's investment in China accounts for 4 percent of its total external investment stock, while China's investment to the EU only takes up 2 percent of the latter's foreign investment, according to the ambassador.

""There is still pretty much room left to expand bilateral cooperation,"" he said.

Talking about the differences between China and the EU on some specific issues, Zhang said that given their different history, culture, national conditions and developing levels, it is normal to have different views.

68,Your Christmas tree could help save the planet,"LONDON-Your unwanted Christmas tree could be processed to produce important chemicals and cut emissions, say researchers.

Pine needles could provide feedstock to create new products, such as sweeteners and paint, as well as cut emissions.

Currently, an estimated seven million trees each year end up in landfill.

A study from the University of Sheffield suggests the process would also result in zero waste, therefore easing pressure on our waste services.

""By now we all know about the problem of greenhouse gas emissions, and the need to reduce carbon emissions,"" explained Cynthia Kartey, a PhD student at the university's Department of Chemical and Biological Engineer

""I see biomass waste as a potential alternative source of feedstock for the chemical industry, for example,"" she told BBC News.

For example, some of the substances found in pine needles are an active ingredient in perfume.

However, by identifying the value from the trees in the form of the potential feedstock for the chemical industry would make it economically sensible to send them to biorefineries, says MissKartey.

This could also lead to a reduction in the UK's carbon footprint as it would cut our dependency on imported plastic trees and a reduction in the amount of tree biomass ending up in landfill, she explained.

Colleague Dr James McGregor added: ""The use of biomass - material derived from plants - to produce fuel and chemicals currently manufactured from fossil resources will play a key role in the future global economy.

""If we can utilise materials that would otherwise go to waste in such process, thereby recycling them, then there are further benefits.""",Pakistan,2018.12
81,"News Analysis: ""Green"" priorities go local in Italy with plans to transform ex-power plants - China.org.cn","You are here:

ROME, Dec. 27 (Xinhua) -- Italy's slow-moving transition away from traditional fuel resources is speeding up on a local level as the process begins to convert a handful of power stations into low environmental-impact facilities with innovative new uses.

The country's former state energy monopoly, Enel, is spearheading the project, which is starting out on two out-of-use plants -- Portoscuso, a former oil-fired plant on the island of Sardinia, and Campomarino, a gas turbine plant in the southern region of Molise.

Enel has identified two-dozen total projects across the country that are in some stage of transition. One is a former mining project and the other 23 ex-power plants.

In a statement, Enel called the larger transformation initiative -- dubbed the ""Futur-e"" strategy -- the company's ""most important and ambitious circular economy project.""

The phrase ""circular economy"" is shorthand for a system that minimizes waste by making systems more efficient, reusing as much as possible, and recycling byproducts.

The idea is not new: The Tate Modern museum in London, the Caixa Forum Cultural Center in Madrid, and Lisbon's Tejo Electricity Museum are all housed in what were once urban power stations.

But what is unusual about the projects in Italy, according to Edoardo Zanchini, national vice-president for the largest Italian environmental lobby group Legambiente, is that most of the 23 plants Enel is seeking for transition are comparatively isolated or in under-developed areas -- in contrast to the projects in Britain, Spain, and Portugal, which are located on valuable real-estate in each country's capital.

""It's an ambitious initiative,"" Zanchini told Xinhua. ""Of the 24 separate projects, some are organized better than others. But together they will result in a major environmental step forward for Italy.""

Portoscuso and Campomarino are the furthest along of the 24 projects, with companies or other entities vying to head the transformation plans required to submit a formal submission of interest early in 2019. Ten more are plants that are approaching a similar phase of development.

Each proposal will be evaluated by specially appointed commissions made up of local stakeholders, academics, analysts and representatives from Enel. Tenders will be judged based on specific needs of the surrounding community, the innovativeness of the proposal, adherence to the guidelines of the ""circular economy"" as well as the long term social, economic and environmental sustainability of the ideas.

Enel officials said the former power plants could be transformed into a wide array of other uses, including low environmental-impact smart villages, recreation sites, shopping areas and Internet technology centers.

Francesco Ferrante, a former senator and co-founder of Green Italia, an advocacy group, told Xinhua the usefulness of the projects goes beyond the specific benefits of individual projects.

""There are obvious environmental benefits of making better use of each plant,"" Ferrante said. ""But there is also very important symbolic value, showing that Italy and a major utility like Enel are taking environmental priorities seriously."" Enditem",China,2018.12
82,How the fashion industry doubled down on sustainability in 2018,"The issue of sustainability took centre stage in the fashion industry in the year 2018, with multiple brands making pragmatic steps to addressing their environmental impact. We take a look at some of the biggest strides made.

PVH, the company that owns Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein and Speedo, signed not one but three major initiatives this year in a bid to reduce the waste generated by its fashion brands and the industry in general.

The group joined the Global Fashion Agenda (GFA), a non-profit initiative that aims to boost sustainability levels within the fashion business, teamed up with Fashion For Good (FFG), an organisation that supports startups in becoming more sustainable, and became a core partner and member of the Advisory Board of The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which works with businesses, government and academia to accelerate and promote a transition to a circular economy.

Denim brand Guess has had a troubled year, but its focus on sustainability remained strong, with the launch of a circular fashion recycling program dubbed ‘Resourced’.

The concept offers US shoppers in-store discounts when they donate used clothing, in an effort to give secondhand pieces new life, and reduce textile waste. The company plans to roll it out globally by 2020.

Gap Inc – which counts Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic on its books – pledged this year to save 10 billion liters of water by the end of 2020.

The fashion conglomerate aims to economise on water resources by focusing on product innovation and improving efficiency at its fabric mills and laundries, and hopes that the initiative will help affected communities achieve better access to clean water and sanitation.

This month, the luxury fashion and lifestyle conglomerate Kering announced the launch of the ‘Sustainable Innovation Award’ – a new fashion prize in China.

Launched in partnership with the innovation platform Plug and Play, the award will single out innovative startups and technologies in Greater China that are offering a positive environmental and social impact by focusing on raw materials, green supply chain concepts and the circular economy, in an attempt to encourage sustainably-minded fashion processes.

Three winners will receive mentorship and networking opportunities to develop their concepts.

This month also saw 43 fashion businesses, including Burberry, H&M, Stella McCartney and Hugo Boss, commit to fighting climate change with the signing of a new “Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action”, a UN Climate Change initiative.

87,How the fashion industry doubled down on sustainability in 2018,"The issue of sustainability took centre stage in the fashion industry in the year 2018, with multiple brands making pragmatic steps to addressing their environmental impact. We take a look at some of the biggest strides made.

PVH, the company that owns Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein and Speedo, signed not one but three major initiatives this year in a bid to reduce the waste generated by its fashion brands and the industry in general.

The group joined the Global Fashion Agenda (GFA), a non-profit initiative that aims to boost sustainability levels within the fashion business, teamed up with Fashion For Good (FFG), an organisation that supports startups in becoming more sustainable, and became a core partner and member of the Advisory Board of The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which works with businesses, government and academia to accelerate and promote a transition to a circular economy.

Denim brand Guess has had a troubled year, but its focus on sustainability remained strong, with the launch of a circular fashion recycling program dubbed ‘Resourced’.

The concept offers US shoppers in-store discounts when they donate used clothing, in an effort to give secondhand pieces new life, and reduce textile waste. The company plans to roll it out globally by 2020.

Gap Inc – which counts Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic on its books – pledged this year to save 10 billion liters of water by the end of 2020.

The fashion conglomerate aims to economise on water resources by focusing on product innovation and improving efficiency at its fabric mills and laundries, and hopes that the initiative will help affected communities achieve better access to clean water and sanitation.

This month, the luxury fashion and lifestyle conglomerate Kering announced the launch of the ‘Sustainable Innovation Award’ – a new fashion prize in China.

Launched in partnership with the innovation platform Plug and Play, the award will single out innovative startups and technologies in Greater China that are offering a positive environmental and social impact by focusing on raw materials, green supply chain concepts and the circular economy, in an attempt to encourage sustainably-minded fashion processes.

Three winners will receive mentorship and networking opportunities to develop their concepts.

This month also saw 43 fashion businesses, including Burberry, H&M, Stella McCartney and Hugo Boss, commit to fighting climate change with the signing of a new “Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action”, a UN Climate Change initiative.

The charter aims to address the role of the fashion industry “on both sides of the climate equation” – meaning that it will focus on the ways in which the sector can reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and focus on sustainable development via 16 different commitments.

89,Sattvik 2018: What shall we take away,"Would you not enjoy at Sattvik, an unusual dish for us that is, aranchini rice ball made of aromatic rice Joha stuffed with different vegetables? Or for that matter, a cheela made of drumstick leaves by another group might give you nutrition, taste and aesthetic pleasure. So many farmers and entrepreneurs have brought different traditional and new dishes. Painting dry cotton balls in different colours is a children idea from dendhuki. You can visit Sattvik tomorrow and also on 25th to partake satvik food, ingredients, crafts are on display by 50 women groups supported by Ministry of Women and Child Development from Jammu and Krishna, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Uttarakhand, Bihar and so any more places.

Children are enjoying the innovation maze designed by GIAN team. Children have to find their way out and when they get lost, they find a new innovation. Should not we all get lost some time if that helps us discover innovations. There is a photo shoot site nearby on a designer cycle rickshaw and also a children creativity spot near GIAN maze. Come and get lost.

It in addition to this, we have tried to add more meaningful cultural activities this time including a poetry session chaired by Shri Raghuveer Chaudhary, a distinguished Jianpeeth awardee. Sessions by eminent doctors on preventive health including by ayurvedic experts, physiotherapist, orthopaedic experts, diabetic specialists etc., are also there.

There were several policy advocacy sessions on behalf of organic farmers and start-ups. Some of the suggestions we made are: a) there should be open access space in every city for farmers to sell their organic produce directly to consumers; b) just as start-ups, generally from urban areas, have been given five years of relief from a lot of procedural requirements, organic farmers should also be allowed for at least ten years to sell their products without too many restrictions and requirements; c) farmers income cannot be increased without reducing costs. One way is to reduce the cost of inputs by using herbal pesticides and growth promoters. SRISTI has perhaps the only lab dedicated to develop such products and test their efficacy. We need many more such well-equipped labs in the country to promote sustainable agriculture; d) dissemination of sustainable practices through kisan call centre must become obligatory. AT this stage they just promote chemical including some which are banned in many other countries; e) the start-ups should share their failures and set back to help budding entrepreneurs in charting their future path; f) not many states have included the stories of innovators from and for grassroots in the textbooks and curriculum; how will a culture of innovation evolve in the true terms, g) the support from regulatory agencies need a lot of strengthening. The motorcycle based and now chahsis based santi, multipurpose agri machine sis still not eligible for to approval and thus is illegal in the strict sense of the terms Every year Gujarat itself has a sale of about ten thousand santis, all illegal but all legitimate. On one had government has a policy of promoting circular economy but on the other, it will not approve solutions using second-hand parts.

I hope we will hear from many of you in coming two days more suggestions to make the eco-system for promoting women based enterprises, organic agriculture, farmer-consumer interface and promotion of innovations for and from grassroots. We will pursue many more ideas at the fourth International conference by the Honey Bee Network on Creativity and Innovation at IIMA January 28-30, 2019. You are welcome to register at iccig.org and learn and share your ideas.

140,Taipei-Shanghai forum opens today in Taipei - Taipei Times,"Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je and Mainland Affairs Council Minister Chen Ming-tong each said discussing economics would help avoid disputes

The twin-city forum between Taipei and Shanghai opens today in Taipei, focusing on economic issues with the circular economy as its theme, Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je (柯文哲) said yesterday.

Held annually by the cities since 2010, the two-day forum has sparked controversy because of China’s suppression of Taiwan in the international community, but Ko said that as long as economics, rather than politics, remained the center of discussion, there were unlikely to be any disputes.

Ko was responding to comments by Mainland Affairs Council Minister Chen Ming-tong (陳明通), who had earlier yesterday said he hoped the forum would not stir up any political turmoil.

Chen said inter-city exchanges across the Taiwan Strait were in line with the council’s policies and he looked forward to seeing the forum proceed smoothly and yield positive results.

Ko agreed, saying that the forum should pay more attention to economic affairs “so that the event generates fewer disputes and proceeds more smoothly.”

Shanghai Vice Mayor Zhou Bo (周波) arrived at Taipei International Airport (Songshan airport) at about 11:30am leading a 135-member delegation.

They were confronted outside the airport by pro-independence protesters holding up banners that read: “Taiwan, China: one country on each side,” and shouting slogans.

However, they were confined to an “opinion expression zone” set up by police.

The Taipei Police Department dispatched about 600 police officers to the airport for crowd control.

Chilly Chen (陳峻涵), office director of the 908 Taiwan Republic Campaign, was dragged out of the airport by police.

Given the nature of the forum, Zhou should limit his discussion to exchanges between the two cities, Chilly Chen said.

“Do not think about doing ‘united front’ [work] here,” he added.

Zhou is participating in the forum on behalf of Shanghai Mayor Ying Yong (應勇), who was unable to attend because of scheduling conflicts.

The Shanghai official told those awaiting his arrival that the forum is the most important mechanism for exchanges across the Strait, and that he expected those in his delegation to make new friends and gain new knowledge.

Shanghai has launched a plan to position itself as a global financial, shipping and technology hub by 2035, Zhou said, adding that he was looking forward to sharing with Taipei counterparts experiences in urban development.

Keynote speeches about the circular economy are to be presented by Taipei Department of Urban Development Commissioner Lin Jou-min (林洲民) and Shanghai Municipal Development and Reform Commission Vice Director Zhou Qiang (周強), the Taipei City Government said.

Cultural development, urban renovation and environmental protection would also be covered, the city government said, adding that the two cities would sign three memorandums of understanding on cooperation.

After his arrival yesterday, Zhou visited power management solution provider Delta Electronics Inc (台達電), one of Taiwan’s biggest high-tech companies.

The city government last night hosted a banquet to welcome the Shanghai delegation.",Taiwan,2018.12

Citibank Taiwan is honored to have been presented with the Best Social Responsibility Award at the Taiwan Banking and Finance Best Practice Awards — known as the Oscars of the financial sector — which was hosted by the Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance in Taipei on Friday.

Having worked in the region for more than half a century, Citibank Taiwan not only wishes to be the best for our clients, but also wishes to embody this spirit when promoting corporate social responsibility for the company.

Citibank Taiwan’s promotion of corporate social responsibility would be made manifest in four fields: connection, inspiration, trust and innovation, Citibank Taiwan chairman Paulus Mok (莫兆鴻) said.

When it comes to corporate social responsibility, Citibank Taiwan no only seeks to surpass charity, but also anticipates to be the mover of social progression, Mok said.

As a leading figure in the financial sector, Citibank Taiwan aspires to take corporate social responsibility standards to a global level. With the UN’s 17 sustainable development goals (SDG) in mind, Citibank Taiwan attained 11 of them from 2016 to last year. This allows local companies to connect with the international community in the development of corporate social responsibility.

Citibank Taiwan has not only answered a call from the Executive Yuan’s Environmental Protection Administration to develop a circular economy and to cut down on plastics, but has also promoted the Financial Supervisory Commission’s Financial Inclusion System by offering financial management education, a strength of the bank.

With the administration and non-governmental organizations (NGO), including the Chi Sing Eco-conservation Foundation, the Taiwan Toy Library Association, the Taiwan Environmental Protection Union and the Homemakers United Foundation, Citibank Taiwan is dedicated to promoting a circular economy.

Adhering to the ideal of “reduce, recycle and reuse,” Citibank Taiwan employees, along with NGO partners, schools and the public, it can attain the goal of reducing plastic production.

Citibank Taiwan is also working closely with NGO partners to foster correct ideas of finance for young people through talks, workshops and consultation meetings.

With Citibank Taiwan’s Pathways to Progress program — one of many the bank has embarked on to foster vocational capabilities among young people — the company hopes to provide fresh graduates not only with a vision for the future, but also foster capabilities to help them become upstanding members of society.",Taiwan,2018.12
181,FNB News - Mountain Dew introduces 33-cl can with fluorescent inks in Middle-East | FNB News,"Mountain Dew, a PepsiCo International brand, has launched a special-edition 33-cl package featuring fluorescent inks in the Middle-East. Designed to attract consumer attention and boost sales in the summer, the ultra-bright green colour on the can accentuates the bold Mountain Dew logo and reinforces the brand’s image.



The neon colour glows in the dark, adding the elements of fun, surprise and interactivity to the packaging for this iconic brand. The inks were applied to beverage cans manufactured at Crown’s facilities in the United Arab Emirates and Jordan at full line speed, ensuring productivity levels were optimised.



Crown also worked closely with PepsiCo and ink supplier INX to secure the necessary regulatory approvals. The neon cans were sold in the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Lebanon, Qatar and Jordan markets from August 2018. 



Metal has impeccable sustainability credentials – cans are 100 per cent and infinitely recyclable – with no loss of properties, making it an important contributor to the circular economy.



Once the containers enter the material-to-material loop, where they get recycled again and again, they can return to store shelves as new beverage cans in as little as 60 days.",India,2018.12
186,The European Commission starts the Circular Plastics Alliance to increase the share of recycled plastics in the supply chain – Plastics Insight,"The European Commission has started the Circular Plastics Alliance of key industries to cover the full plastics value chain to reduce plastics littering, increase the share of recycled plastics and help market innovation.

The Circular Plastics Alliance will make efforts to improve the economics and quality of plastics recycling in Europe. Matching between supply and demand for recycled plastics is found to be the main obstacle to a well-functioning EU market of recycled plastics.

The launching of the Circular Plastics Alliance will contribute to achieving at least 10 million tons of recycled plastics into new products on the EU market by 2025.

“Close cooperation within and between all the links in the plastics value chain is essential if we are to achieve a true circular plastics economy and ensure that recycled plastics find their way to new products, instead of into landfills or the incinerators”, said, Frans Timmermans, First Vice President responsible for sustainable development. He, added, “The Circular Plastics Alliance aims to facilitate this cooperation, building on the commitments the plastics industry has already made and encouraging even more ambitious action. Europe already leads this, and Europe will be the first one to reap the benefits as well. This is the best way to show the world that circular plastic economy is good for the business and good for the environment.”

Jyrki Katainen, Vice-President, responsible for Jobs, Growth, Investment and Competitiveness, commented, “European industry has already clearly committed to more sustainable plastics with the pledges that they have submitted to the Commission. Business understands this is an opportunity to innovate and to become global frontrunners in new technology and materials, in line with circular economy logic.”",India,2018.12
