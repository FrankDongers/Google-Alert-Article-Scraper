9,EU volunteers take part in Karachi’s Sandspit beach cleaning,"KARACHI: The volunteers of European Union in Pakistan and World Wide Fund for Nature – Pakistan (WWF-Pakistan) led a two-day cleaning activity at Sandspit beach.

“Only 10 rivers around the world are responsible for 85% of the plastic pollution of the oceans. Of these, eight rivers are located in Asia, including River Indus,” said EU Ambassador HE Jean-François Cautain.

Speaking at the occasion, Ambassador Cautain said that the EU is committed to increasing awareness about plastic waste and its impact on marine life and the environment. The single-use plastic initiative is part of the EU’s broader Circular Economy agenda, including the world’s first Plastics Strategy, an EU-wide drive towards a more sustainable, circular economy.

As part of the Plastics Strategy, the EU has committed itself to look into further action to address marine litter that builds on the efforts underway in EU member states. He said, “The problem of marine litter is global by nature as it moves in the marine environment and adversely affects marine life.”

More than 70 volunteers from WWF-Pakistan and EU participated in the event. A total of 300 mangrove saplings were also planted while 100 bags of garbage were collected by the participants.

WWF-Pakistan Regional Head for Sindh and Balochistan Dr Babar Khan informed that Pakistan is among the top ten countries affected by climate change and one of the simplest actions citizens can take is to help increase the forest cover of the country, one tree at a time.

“Turtles maintain the health of the sea and removing them from the waters negatively impacts the marine ecosystem,” Dr Khan said. According to an estimate, there are more than 3,000 turtle nests on Sandspit.",Tuvalu,2018.09
79,"Algeria's resources favour investment in circular economy, says Zerouati","BLIDA-Algeria has resources “likely to make it an attractive destination” for investment in circular economy, which must play a key role in the development of non-hydrocarbon economy, Minister of Environment and Renewable Energy, Fatma Zahra Zerouati said Wednesday in a meeting.

“Algeria produces 34 million tonnes of waste/year, and is expected to reach 70 million tonnes by 2035, of which 50% is recyclable (plastic, household and similar waste),” said Zerouati in a speech she delivered at the closing ceremony of the first regional Centre-West conference on circular economy.

Such an effort requires investment in this reserve ""as a source of job-generating wealth"", said the minister, underscoring, by the same token, ""the important role of circular economy and recycling in supporting a non-hydrocarbon economy.”

In this connection, Zerouati announced the initiative of the responsible ministry to organize regional preparatory meetings for the First National Conference on Circular Economy in February. The Blida meeting, the first of its kind, aims ""to lay the foundations for this ambitious project, in collaboration with all parties concerned.”

At the end of this event, which included nine workshops focusing on three main themes relating to sustainable clean production, sustainable consumption, recycling and recovery of waste and its transformation into raw materials, the speakers agreed on the need to provide ""facilities for project holders wishing to invest in this field, notably the reduction of the interest rate on the credits allocated.”

Recommendations focused on the need to reduce taxes on the interests of companies in the field, in parallel with the extension of the time limits for the repayment of credits allocated to them.

A proposal was also made to give priority to the holders of circular economy projects in terms of industrial land.

The legislation governing the sector has not been overlooked since a recommendation has been issued for a revision of the Executive Decree on the Integrated Waste Management Master Plan to introduce circular economy, in parallel with the revision of Law No.19.01 on waste management, control and disposal dated 2001.

83,A perspective on a locally managed decentralized circular economy for waste plastic in developing countries,"Plastics are used in every country on earth and none is able to successfully collect and manage 100% of its plastic waste. Once produced, plastic enters the global supply chain and is used in all regions of the world. In fact, our world is generating, consuming, and discarding more plastic than ever, and the rates are increasing 1-5. The growth rate of plastic production has increased at 5% per year worldwide 1. In 2010, approximately 270 million metric tons (MT) of plastic were produced, with 99.5 million discarded as waste by coastal populations living within 50 km of the coast 6. Additionally, it was estimated that of the plastic waste generated that year, 31.9 million MT were mismanaged on land and 4.8–12.7 million MT entered the oceans 6. If current trends continue, by 2050, 33 billion MT of plastic are likely to be produced, with approximately 12.2 billion MT disposed of as waste, 3.9 billion MT mismanaged on land, and 0.6–1.6 billion MT eventually entering the oceans 2, 6. This is a 122‐fold increase in a matter of 40 yrs, meaning that global plastic production is increasing exponentially. Just between 2015 and 2026, we will make as much plastic as has been made since its production began 3.

There are numerous potential resting spots for waste plastic in the ecosystem including disposal in landfills, recycling, incineration, and unregulated dumping. Disposal on land is the most common option with previous studies showing that globally 60% of plastic municipal solid waste (MSW) is discarded in open space or in landfills 1. A key challenge is that in much of the world, appropriate waste disposal options are unavailable, including properly managed landfills, leading to waste plastic simply being dumped on open unestablished plots, accumulating on sides of roadways, and on outskirts of rural residential areas. This accumulation of plastic waste on land can become a breeding ground for mosquitoes, cause clogged waterways and drainages, and reduce the general aesthetics of the community 1. As plastic can take thousands of years to decompose, both landfills and unregulated plots of land will remain unusable long after the dumping ends 7, 8, and if not managed properly, chemicals can leach from the plastic into surrounding habitats 2. Eventually, this plastic waste will be disposed of in, or migrate to surface waters, generating pollution and threating both terrestrial and marine life. Specifically in major bodies of water, plastic waste is ingested by marine life and bird species, resulting in adverse health effects, entanglement, and death 2-4, 9-11.

Figure 1 shows plastic bags collecting in a drainage canal in Kampala, Uganda, due to unregulated dumping. This is a common problem in many resource‐constrained or infrastructure limited parts of the world, where lack of effective governmental policy, MSW management administration and planning, along with insufficient household education, economic pressures, limited perspectives on hazards associated with waste accumulation, and scarce stakeholder involvement affect how waste is disposed or managed 12, 13. Other factors include growing economies, urbanization, and increased standards of living, which led to rapid increases in waste generation in developing countries 14. In rural regions particularly, access to centralized collection and recycling methods are often unavailable. Consequently, uncontrolled growth coupled with lack of sufficient infrastructure and regulation in underdeveloped regions of developing countries compounds the waste management problem 15-18. Because these factors include economic and social as well as environmental components, it is critical that proposed solutions include them as well. Therefore, in our view, without considering the three pillars of sustainability, MSW management solutions are unlikely to achieve long‐term success.

Unfortunately, there are currently no globally effective strategies to keep waste plastic out of the ecosystem that meet the challenges of both developed and developing countries. This is primarily because waste plastic is not a point‐source pollutant. As plastic enters the ecosystems from numerous points, it has been a major obstacle for control 5. Moreover, low‐income and low‐to‐middle income countries lack the resources to address this problem. In fact, in addition to lack of waste collection and management infrastructure in underdeveloped regions, researchers have identified that simply the lack of convenient waste disposal containers can affect household waste disposal decisions 15, 19. If people have to walk long distances to reach a suitable disposal location, they will simply dump the waste nearby on streets, underdeveloped plots of land, or burn it, leading to potentially toxic smoke, especially if plastics are present. This underscores our assertion that locally managed decentralized solutions—targeting waste where it is generated rather than focusing on centralized processing—may be more effective in communities where governmental waste solution efforts are minimal. This type of approach empowers individuals and small communities to adapt and invent solutions rather than waiting on central authorities to enact policies and regulations to address the problem. As a result, a locally managed decentralized circular economy of plastic products is generated, encouraging direct users of plastic to consider and benefit from opportunities of providing waste plastic a value, or by generating new life cycles for plastic products through a cradle‐to‐cradle approach 20. We assert that a decentralized circular economy of plastic at the local level can have tremendous benefits in reducing the accumulation of plastic waste on land and its eventual migration to major bodies of water. An industrial circular economy replaces the produce‐consume‐discard model by reusing, recycling, or reentering products into their manufacturing supply chain on an industrial scale 20-28. However, at the local level, especially in rural regions, remanufacturing of plastic products, or creating the infrastructure networks to reenter them into their respective supply chains is difficult. Traditional solutions, like centralized recycling of plastic waste, are also often impractical in remote regions, or regions lacking well‐developed infrastructure due to the transportation costs, making large‐scale recycling operations uneconomical. Hence, a locally managed decentralized circular economy functions to manage waste on small scale in rural regions, without the need of industrial technologies or developed infrastructure. Viable solutions are those that are low cost, can be implemented utilizing the region's technical knowledge, and most importantly provide an incentive for local people to collect, reuse, and recycle themselves. In many economically disadvantaged regions, an informal local recycling sector exists via a system of waste pickers that sort through dumpsites to collect saleable materials such as metals, plastics, glass, and papers 21, 29-33. Often, waste pickers travel throughout communities of rural regions and cities to collect recyclables from house‐to‐house as well, or set up recycling drop‐off locations, paying individuals a small incentive for valuable materials. Afterward, the waste pickers will sort through collected materials, clean, and sell them to recycling companies for a profit. These companies then shred and process the materials as desired by manufacturing organizations. In this way, rural communities and heavily populated urban centers of developing countries benefit from a decentralized circular economy of recyclable materials, including plastics. However, not all plastics that are recyclable are of value to waste pickers due to a nonexistent recycling market. For instance, polyethylene shopping bags are generated in large volumes globally, but they are recycled in extremely low quantities 21, accumulating on sides of streets, dumps, and landfills in developing countries. Even in the United States, 380 billion plastic bags are consumed annually, with only 5.2% being recycled 7, 8. So, unless waste plastic items, such as polyethylene bags can be given a value, they will continue to be unsustainably used and discarded. Therefore, we assert that a locally managed decentralized circular economy with informal recycling playing a vital role in decreasing the accumulation of plastic waste is needed. Furthermore, we believe that including social and economic considerations in addition to environmental are critical to successful waste plastic abatement strategies in underdeveloped regions, which has been lacking in most plastic abatement strategies. In Figure 2, we propose a strategy for establishing a circular economy at the local level by applying the three principles of sustainability to decentralized waste plastic management. This strategy is thermal decomposition of waste plastic to fuel oil at temperatures of 400°C–450°C 34, 35. High‐density polyethylene, low‐density polyethylene, polystyrene, and polypropylene plastics 7, 8, 34-45 can be easily converted to fuel similar in composition to diesel and kerosene by individual entrepreneurs utilizing appropriate technology (AT), providing a potential path to a locally managed decentralized circular economy. AT is simple nonautomated technology requiring little to no electricity, designed for a specific region to meet specific challenges according to available resources 34. An AT solution for thermal decomposition of waste plastic is the UKATS Processor 34, 35. This invention is constructed locally utilizing existent construction materials, available infrastructure, technical knowledge of intended users, and from easily acquired locally generated plastic wastes. For instance, the UKATS Processor is wood fired to allow for the skills of rural communities that operate wood fired cookstoves to be readily applied. Moreover, the desired plastics can be easily collected by waste pickers or entrepreneurs by either identifying the plastic recycling numbers (2, 4, 5, and 6, respectively) or by performing a simple density test of the shredded plastics in water. That is, if the waste plastics float on water, they are suitable for reprocessing to fuel oil. A locally managed decentralized circular economy for waste plastic in infrastructure limited regions. [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com Consequently, a locally managed decentralized circular economy gives waste plastic an economic value, which incentivizes people to collect and use it locally, reducing waste accumulation. It further significantly reduces the need for physical and technical infrastructure to implement an industrial circular economy of plastic by involving local community participation as shown in Figure 2. In addition, this approach is socially and environmentally appropriate. For instance, as accumulation of waste decreases, sanitation issues decrease, improving community health. Likewise, environmental benefits are reaped by decreasing waste leachate into soil and reducing toxic hazards associated with incineration of plastic waste—a commonly practiced alternative to managing accumulation in rural regions and near slums 38, 40. The fuel oil itself also does not have sulfur dioxide emissions as sulfur is not present in the carbon‐hydrogen plastic polymer chains, reducing greenhouse gas sulfur dioxide emissions in comparison with traditional petroleum derived fuels 34.

We propose that in order to identify countries that will have the greatest potential for a locally managed decentralized circular economy, the three pillars of sustainability—environmental, economic, and social acceptability—should be incorporated. Hence, waste plastic abatement strategies cannot simply focus on the environment; they must also be economically viable and socially acceptable. We believe that unless solutions are targeted to be appropriate for the communities for which they are intended, they will ultimately be unsuccessful. To validate this perspective, we developed a simple metric that utilizes a big data approach to analyze countries' outlook in each of the three pillars of sustainability, highlighting regions where a locally managed decentralized circular economy for plastic is likely to have the highest positive impact. Today, data availability is better than it has ever been. Governments, private corporations, and NGOs are collecting ever increasing volumes of data, and much of that data is now publicly available and readily accessible via the Internet. This data is useful in conducting sustainability assessments for individual countries and regions. Here, it is organized and analyzed to identify countries which can potentially benefit from a plastic circular economy at the local level with decentralized waste plastic abatement strategies. The purpose of this metric is therefore to identify countries that have specific challenges with any or all three of the pillars of sustainability in meeting their waste management challenges, in return directly affecting the way plastic waste is handled. Often waste management is a priority in urbanized regions of developing countries, with little attention given to rural regions. Challenges such as variation in income level, conditions of road infrastructure, and perception of communities toward waste, including education regarding hazards associated with waste influence the way waste is handled in both urban and rural regions. As a result, wealthy communities experience regular waste collection, while slums outside of a city are perceived as dumping grounds for waste. Thus, our approach considers the challenges facing each country or region, in terms of economic, social, and environmental concerns to propose decentralized waste plastic solutions that are tailored to the region's availability of infrastructure, capital, and technical knowledge. Moreover, if community participation is prioritized, engineered AT solutions are more likely to be accepted, leading to intended uses and benefits, reducing the dependency on central waste collection and management for rural regions, specifically. In this metric, a list of 200 countries was analyzed using nine indicators, representing the three pillars of sustainability—economic, social, and environmental. These indicators are described in Table 1 and were chosen because they identify countries with widespread poverty, underdeveloped infrastructure, weak governmental institutions, and an existing MSW management problem—key indicators for determining the suitability of a locally managed decentralized circular economy. The development of the metric (see Eq. 1 ) considers assigning specific and global weighting factors to each of the nine indicators mentioned in Table 1 to highlight the importance of each indicator and the environmental, economic, or social outlook of the countries. As a result, a country's specific and global weighting factors can be individually adjusted to ensure that the country's outlook, challenges, and advantages are equally highlighted. Afterward, the sum of indicators and respective weighting factors results in a comparison score of each country's viability for a locally managed decentralized circular economy. Further details of this approach are described in the Supplementary Information. Indicators used to develop metric for identifying regions most suitable for a consumer‐focused decentralized circular economy. This indicator gives a general overview of the wealth of the country, which is directly associated with the availability of developed infrastructure. As GDP alone is not enough to characterize the economic wellbeing of a country's population, this indicator was included as well. This indicator shows the magnitude of the MSW generated in a country. This indicator shows the concentration of MSW by including the country's land area. This indicator is specific to the key focus of this perspective, which is waste plastic. This indicator provides an overview of the suitability of a locally managed decentralized solution targeted at mismanaged waste. This indicator shows how many people can be potentially impacted by proposed perspective and abatement solutions. This indicator shows the general wealth of the population and how likely they are to benefit from entrepreneurial opportunities associated with waste management. This indicator relates population to the rate of waste accumulation per land area, identifying hurdles of waste collection as crowded countries often have infrastructure challenges. where G is the global weighting factor, I is the indicator type, S indicates specific weighting factor corresponding to an individual indicator, EC denotes economic, SC denotes social, and EV denotes environmental. This metric can be utilized by researchers, policy makers, and other users to achieve an in‐depth understanding of a country's waste management outlook, particularly with respect to the economic and social indicators, which are often overlooked. Users can adjust local or global indicator weighting factors according to a region's unique challenges or to emphasize a specific category that contributes to plastic waste mismanagement. Hence, opportunities for managing waste can be identified, with a locally managed decentralized circular economy being a viable approach.

For the base case, all local and global weighting factors for each of the nine indicators were weighted equally. The results of the big data analysis metric for identifying key regions suitable for a locally managed decentralized circular economy are illustrated in Figure 3. Darker colors represent countries that are most likely to benefit from this approach. It can be observed that sub‐Saharan Africa, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia are the most promising regions for applying decentralized solutions to plastic waste management. This information indicates that typically, developing highly populated low‐middle to middle income countries are the most important targets for locally managed decentralized waste plastic abatement strategies. The reason being that even though the citizens of these countries generate less waste per capita , the consequence of higher population density results in an overall larger amount of MSW generation than developed regions. Coupled with limited financial resources, lack of infrastructure and reliable access to energy 20, waste is increasingly susceptible to unsound disposal in open dumps, streets, and waterways, especially in rural communities. Contrastingly, developing nations considered by the metric that may consume greater amounts of energy and generate higher amounts of MSW per capita are not ideal locations for a locally managed decentralized circular economy due to the reasons of improved collection, strong waste management infrastructure, controlled waste disposal, and an existent centralized, industrial circular economy, leading to reduction in unsound waste disposal. Suitable regions for a locally managed decentralized circular economy for plastic. [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com The usefulness of this metric can be additionally demonstrated by weighting one of the three sustainability categories greater than the rest as per the user's interests. To illustrate this, the weighting of global sustainability indicators was varied by assigning a value of 50% to one, while the other two were set to 25%. This analysis is presented in Table 2 and signifies that when weighting the global economic indicator higher, countries with relatively low GDP per capita and high percentages of population living below the poverty line rise to the top as most suitable regions. In like manner, for social sustainability, countries with the greatest population numbers or population density are recommended. Meanwhile, estimated plastic waste in MSW 2016 and estimated unsound disposal of plastic waste in MT/day were found to be the biggest contributing factors for environmental sustainability highlighting regions suffering from uncontrolled waste accumulation. Lastly, the metric also depicts the impact of environmental stress, or the amount of waste generated per km2 of land. Countries that rank highly in this category include the United States, many western European nations as well as high‐income Southeast Asian countries, such as Hong Kong, Macao, and Singapore, which have significant environmental stress due to either high generation of MSW, population density, and/or limited land area 46, 47. Comparison of 20 countries most suitable for decentralized waste plastic solutions according to different sustainability category weightings. As an example, India had the position of being 10th overall in this metric analysis, while being 52nd, 8th, and 5th most suitable country when global economic, social, and environmental indicators were respectively highlighted for implementation of a locally managed decentralized circular economy. Therefore, it can be concluded that for India, the lack of waste management education, attitude toward environmental protection, and insufficient collection infrastructure combined with increased waste generation due to population density are the most probable causes of plastic waste accumulation, instead of capital constraints. It is also important to note that even though a circular economy is well established in China, the country currently practices a centralized industrial circular economy 22-24. Hence, it could likewise benefit from a locally managed decentralized circular economy approach in rural regions due to high waste generation associated large populations. Although this analysis may appear to simply reinforce well‐established beliefs, these results are used to make the point that developing urban and rural regions around the world are different, in return requiring different strategies for MSW and waste plastic abatement. The information obtained from the analysis suggests that African nations vary in their economic, social, and environmental stance compared with developing regions of Asia. This fact in itself alters the way waste management is approached in these countries, as cultural norms associated with perception of waste management vary. Another example is the data highlighting importance of waste recycling in the Americas versus in Europe. Even though both regions are developed, environmentally benign waste management is practiced in many European nations via a variety of waste‐to‐energy solutions, while a large portion of waste in the United States goes to the landfill. Hence, the data are used to make the case for designing and developing technologies based on each region's outlook, suggesting a locally managed decentralized circular economy in rural regions of developing countries.

The country of Uganda is positioned 32nd in the metric assessment, meaning that it has great potential for a locally managed decentralized circular economy with informal recycling waste management approaches. Uganda has a population of 38.3 million, with a growth rate of 3.22% in 2016 48. The size of the country is slightly smaller in area than the U.S. state of Oregon 46. The nation has abundant natural resources, fertile soil, sufficient rainfall, and small deposits of precious minerals and oil 48. Consequently, agriculture and service sectors employ a combined 78.9% of the population, with coffee revenues accounting for the majority of the exports 48. Nonetheless, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency reports that Uganda is facing economic challenges due to sharp increase in refugees from South Sudan, high energy costs, inadequate transportation and energy infrastructure, insufficient budgetary discipline, and corruption 48. Furthermore, during 2015 and 2016, the Uganda shilling depreciated 50% against the U.S. dollar 48. Moreover, the nation's GDP per capita is equivalent to 2100 USD, with 9.4% unemployment rate and 19.7% of the population below poverty line 48. This along with only 15% of the total population having access to electricity, and 19.1% population having access to sanitation facilities, has further led to very high risks of major infectious diseases 48. Despite these challenges, the nation is poised as a good fit for implementation of decentralized waste management solutions, offering opportunities to recycle plastic waste locally, creating jobs and reducing the spread of diseases due to accumulation of trash. A case study conducted in Uganda at the Kiteezi landfill in the capital city of Kampala reveals some insight on how the proposed metric has been employed for this region. In 2015, the population of Kampala was reported to be approximately 1.9 million, with 70% of the citizens living in informal settlements scattered around the city 48, 49. However, as the country's capital, it is the home of major markets and a wide assortment of job opportunities which leads to a doubling of the city's population during the day 48, increasing waste generation. Therefore, small‐scale decentralized AT solutions to waste management are suggested for this city with both the community's and waste pickers' participation. Currently, the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA), a governmental solid waste management organization, provides collection and cleanup services to the city's five divisions (a total 210 km2 area) 48, contracting collection of waste from affluent areas to private companies 49, 50. Hence, the affluent areas are charged a waste collection fee, while the rest of the urban population is serviced by KCCA at no cost 49. KCCA further manages the city's 36‐acre 25‐m tall landfill site at Kiteezi, where both KCCA and private sector waste collection vehicles unload MSW, excluding industrial waste, free of charge 49, 50. At present, a total of 1300–1500 MT of MSW per day are landfilled, about half of the total waste generated by the city 50. This means that the other half is openly dumped in areas inaccessible to waste collection vehicles, including drainage channels, wetlands, natural water courses, manholes, undeveloped plots, or on the roadside 50-52. This is a strong indication that consumer involvement and decentralized solutions to waste accumulation are needed. The composition of the waste mainly consists of bio‐degradable food and garden waste (71.4%), stones and debris (8.6%), plastics (7.8%), paper (2.7%), glass and metals (1.5%), textiles (1.3%), and others (6.7%) 37. KCCA spends approximately 13.4 USD/MT for waste collection and disposal services 49. Waste to energy solutions and organized recycling services are not yet offered by KCCA. Nonetheless, small independently operated recycling drop‐offs exist in the city's districts. As these recycling drop‐offs are new to the city, each district only has one thus far, handling merely 3–4 tons of waste per week. Consequently, most of the waste is sent to the Kiteezi landfill, where it is informally sorted for recycling by waste pickers. With 500 in number, the organized community of waste pickers who live surrounding the landfill collect anything that has a well‐developed market, such as construction tarps, plastic bottles, paper, glass, and metals 49. More specifically, the plastic waste that is recycled by the waste pickers is purchased by domestic and international organizations that pay the pickers 500 UGX/kg. A waste picker typically collects around 40 kg/day of plastic, earning 20,000 UGX/day, which is higher than the average city dweller, who earns around 4,500 UGX/day 49. However, the waste pickers do not collect soft plastics (composition 3.8% of total MSW) 50, such as polyethylene shopping bags—known locally as kaveera s—as they do not have a ready recycling market. Furthermore, despite the ban on production of plastic bags in the country, similar to 15 other African nations 53-55, lenient governmental enforcement allows for illegal selling of the polyethylene bags 55. Consequently, the kaveeras are likely to continue to accumulate in the Kiteezi landfill in the coming years unless action is taken. Therefore, we recommend that close‐coupled decentralized circular economy of plastic be encouraged via strategies such as conversion of polyethylene shopping bags and other soft plastics to fuel oil and similar products through AT 7, 8, 34, 35. This is a viable solution that can further create employment opportunities. Using the statistics previously mentioned, roughly 49,400 kg of soft plastics are brought to the Kiteezi landfill per day. If 40 kg/day of soft plastic waste can be picked by an individual, a resulting 1235 additional jobs could be created at the Kiteezi site. Because the amount of soft plastics brought to the landfill are only half of that generated within the city, a similar opportunity exists for local citizens, entrepreneurs, and communities to recycle the waste plastic to fuel, creating additional jobs. The amount of fuel generated could be used as a substitute for kerosene and diesel applications, especially for cooking, lighting, generators, and farming machinery 34. This establishment of a locally managed decentralized circular economy could potentially have a monumental impact on the accumulation of nondegradable soft plastic accumulation at the Kiteezi landfill and in the Kampala city, improving the aesthetics of the region, and providing entrepreneurial and job opportunities, which will eventually benefit the entire nation 34. Thus, by employing the perspective metric established in this research, the results of this case study serve as an example for other nations. The metric's use of sustainability‐focused indicators can assist in identifying a region's potential suitability for a locally managed decentralized circular economy for waste plastic management.",N/A,2018.12

171,"FBRA Affirms Recycling Crucial to Environmental Preservation, Job and","The Food and Beverage Recycling Alliance (FBRA) has emphasised that recycling of waste, especially those of food and beverage packaging is vital in environmental preservation as the value chain in the recycling process leads to job and wealth creation.

According to FBRA Vice Chairman, Adekunle Olusuyi, who spoke at the two-day 12th National Stakeholders’ Forum of the National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency (NESREA) in Abuja on Thursday, the Alliance has been intensifying awareness on separation of waste and environmental pollution, especially on post-consumer polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles which can further be recycled to other useful products.

Olusuyi, who attended the forum with other FBRA members, explained that FBRA participation in the summit was in line with the Alliance’s commitment to the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policy of the government, to help build a sustainable healthy environment that leads to business growth.

“We are looking at the entire packaging lifecycle – from how bottles and cans are designed and made, to how they are recycled and repurposed. We want to reduce the waste we generate as much as possible, encourage recycling, and our initiatives in this regard have been well tailored in achieving tangible results along with our partners,” he stated.

The stakeholders’ forum, which had the theme, Circular Economy and Environmental Governance, provided a platform for an in-depth discussion and array of issues focusing on Circular Economy and Environmental Governance, as well as critical factor in attaining sustainable development in the national development plan.

It also enabled stakeholders highlight waste-to-wealth initiatives, review progress in the implementation of the EPR programme, strengthen policies and regulations to enable the recycling of food grade packaging waste materials by establishing a national standards for recycled PET and determine how Producer Responsibility Organisations (PRO) can support in waste management for a healthy environment, recycling roles, among others.

The FBRA vice chairman avowed that in a circular economy, proper waste management which involves different stages leads to job and wealth creation along the value chain.

According to Olusuyi, a recent survey indicates that the volume of post-consumer PET waste is over 800,000 tonnes which requires the participation of all stakeholders at the different stages to drive a robust circular economy.

“The various roles in waste management starts from waste separation, the collection which our partner, RecyclePoints takes care of, to separation, transportation, shredding at the recycling plants, production of other products and re-use. At these stages, different jobs are created, whether directly or indirectly,” Olusuyi explained.

He, therefore, urged other companies in the food and beverage sector, to be part of the Alliance which has sworn in its resolve to protect the environment and help make the world packaging problem a thing of the past.

In moving towards a circular economy, the Technical Lead, FBRA, Nwamaka Onyemelukwe, who represented the Chairman, Sade Morgan pointed out that the Alliance, as a PRO, will help improve recycling rates and apply the global marketing muscle of its members to help educate the public on what, how and where to recycle their food and beverage packaging waste.

The Alliance will continue to partner with local communities, non-government organisations (NGOs), industry peers and consumers to help make recycling easier and more accessible for everyone by improving collection systems, local recycling systems and driving policy change that supports a truly circular economy.

“As part of FBRA ambitious goal towards a cleaner environment, it has concluded plans to clean up the waterways in collaboration with its partner, RecyclePoints and the Ministries of Transportation as well as Environment in Lagos state, she said.

Onyemelukwe added that with an estimated annual growth rate of 2.6 percent in Nigeria, there is an increase in the level of consumption which has translated to rise in the volume of the waste generation that needs to be well tackled; hence FBRA has been embarking on various initiatives towards a cleaner environment.

Recently, the Alliance received accolades from the Lagos State Government through the Ministry of the Environment during a clean-up exercise at the Arena Market in Oshodi, Lagos, in commemoration of this year’s World Cleanup Day.

Founded in 2013, FBRA consists of responsible forward-thinking companies with a shared concern for the environment which includes; Nigerian Bottling Company Limited/ Coca-Cola Nigeria Limited; Nigerian Breweries Plc; Seven-Up Bottling Company Limited; Nestle Nigeria Plc and Guinness Nigeria Plc.",Denmark,2018.12
172,Year Ender - Looking into progress in Indonesia-EU cooperation - ANTARA News,"Tangerang, Banten (ANTARA News) - The European Union (EU) and Indonesia have developed cooperation agreements in various sectors in the past several years as outlined in the European Union-Indonesia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA).

 

 The 3rd Joint Committee was already formed in the framework of the European Union-Indonesia PCA on December 11, 2018 in Brussels, Belgium. The meeting was opened and jointly chaired by Director General for American and European Affairs of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Muhammad Anshor and Managing Director for Asia and Pacific of the European External Action Service Gunnar Wiegand.

 

 On that occasion, the EU conveyed condolence on the tragic losses of many lives in the natural disasters in Lombok and Palu and expressed solidarity and support in the process of recovering the devastated areas.

 

 Muhammad Anshor said that at the meeting of the 3rd Joint Committee the EU and Indonesian delegations reviewed the existing cooperation and considered initiative to promote cooperation in various fields in the future.

 

 Concerning cooperation in security, the Third Meeting of the Indonesia-EU Security Dialog which was held in Jakarta on November 29 in 2018 recorded an increase in interactions and bilateral cooperation over the issues related to security as reflected in the comprehensive agenda such as in Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP), maritime security, counter terrorism, organized crimes, narcotics policy, disaster control, and consulate protection.

 

 Meanwhile, the EU and Indonesia commemorated the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Both sides welcomed open and constructive exchange of information during the annual event of the Human Rights Dialog and the two-day seminar with theme ""Addressing Hate Speech and Disinformation with a Rights-based Approach"" in October, 2018 in Jakarta. The next Human Right Dialog of Indonesia-EU would be held in Brussels in 2019.

 

 In addition, the EU and Indonesia have recorded progress in the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (I-EU CEPA), which aims to open big potential of bilateral cooperation in investment, growth and sustainable development. The 7th round of negotiations would take place in Brussels in March 11-15 in 2019.

 

 Both sides expressed satisfaction with the increase in the involvement of and cooperation in ""circular economy"" and maritime fields. Circular economy is an alternative to traditional linear economy (make, use, cast off), and be replaced with activities keeping resources, for sustainability, extract maximum value from resource when used and recover and regenerate products and material at the end of each cycle of process.

 

 On palm oil issue, the EU explained attempt already taken concerning Delegated Act under the Renewable Energy Directive II (RED II). In reaction to that the government of Indonesia stressed the importance of palm oil for the country`s economy and policy to ensure the sustainability aspect of palm oil.

 

 The Indonesian government then expressed concern with the EU policy of RED II and Delegated especially with the use of the criteria ""Low Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) risk"" as the basis of development of new certificate for conventional bio-fuel. The policy in Indonesia`s view, tended to discriminate against palm oil in favor of other bio-fuel products. Therefore, the government of Indonesia and the EU agreed to continue cooperation in the important and sensitive issue.

 

 The government of Indonesia appreciated the decision of the European Commission in June 2018 to lift all certificated airlines in Indonesia from the black list of EU Safety List after improvement made in the system of flight safety meeting the international standards.

 

 Anshor said Indonesia and the EU appreciate the quality of development cooperation being in progress in the good governance, reformation of public fund management, climate change and trade-related assistance.

 

 One example of progress made in development cooperation by the two sides is in blended finance project with development banks of the member countries of the EU supporting key reform and ""One Platform SDG"" of Indonesia.

 

 Indonesia and the EU also welcomed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the European Investment Bank and the government of Indonesia, which determines financing frame for key investment projects in the green infrastructure sector.

 

 In the issue of environment and climate change, the EU and Indonesia see the efforts to achieve the target of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and steps to mitigate impact of climate change as an important goal.

 

 Therefore, in the second Working Group on the Environment and Climate Change in March, 2018, in Brussels, the EU and Indonesia discussed in particular the low emission policy, long term climate strategy, sustainable finance, adaptation strategy, fauna and flora diversity, forestry, circular economy and cooperation under G20 related to topics of mutual interest.

 

 Both sides also specially recorded the final report of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in urgent requirement to promote cooperation, ambition and implementation of climate action.

 

 The EU and Indonesia have succeeded in reaching Voluntary Partnership Agreement for the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT), which begin to be effective two years earlier. The agreement constituted a successful scheme in the global struggle against illegal felling of trees and trade of timber products.

 

 In order to continue Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between Indonesia and the EU, delegations of the two sides agreed to hold a Joint Commission meeting in Jakarta in 2019.

196,New Life for Wind Turbines with Innovation and the Circular Economy | REVE News of the wind sector in Spain and in the world,"Wind turbines, the circular economy and recycling are at the heart of Enel Green Power’s new Challenge, open to start-ups, companies and individual innovators. How can we reuse the enormous blades of wind generators? Over to you!

The average operating life of a wind turbine is about twenty years. After that, its efficiency decreases and it must undergo a complete review. If its conditions are especially compromised, however, it’s time for retirement, even for a wind turbine, and it is completely replaced. The internal metal components are already recycled and reused, but what should be done with the enormous blades in glass or carbon fibre?

This is the challenge that Enel Green Power is launching through the Open Innovability platform. We want to collect and listen to innovative and sustainable proposals and ideas to give new life to wind turbines, within the paradigm of the circular economy.

The main driver pushing us to launch this challenge is the development of sustainable solutions to characterise our processes. The solutions will have to respond to technological needs as well as challenges due to the large volumes in play. With the now imminent end of operation for the first generation of wind turbines, in fact, their fate is becoming a global challenge.

 We’re Listening to Your Sustainable Ideas

A large-scale wind turbine can be over 60 metres long and weigh over 20 tonnes. If we consider that every wind turbine is composed of three blades and there are wind farms with over 100 turbines, the numbers in play are impressive.

This is why the solution presented through Open Innovability must take into account the quantity of the material used, which in one single wind farm can easily arrive at 1000 tonnes, or even more. How can we best manage that?

And that’s not all. Is it possible to find a solution as close as possible to the plant, geographically? With the numbers in play, the transport of blades for significant distances may not be the most efficient solution.

At Enel Green Power, we don’t like simple challenges and we are actively working to include and extend the concepts of the circular economy in all our processes.

The ideas coming from the platform must be simple and flexible, replicable around the world, affordable and able to recover the highest percentage of material possible from individual blades, in line with the basic principles of the circular economy.

We’re facing a real challenge, which is why we’re asking for your help!

For the best ideas, there’s a $10,000 reward, which will be given to the winner based on the conditions specified in the regulations.

285,Poland to go ‘circular’: gov’t minister,"Poland aims to move toward a resource-efficient “circular economy,” a government minister declared on Wednesday.

Jadwiga Emilewicz, minister for technology and enterprise, was referring to a system in which raw materials and products are extensively reused and waste is minimised.

She was speaking during a panel discussion held as part of the United Nations’ COP24 climate change conference in the southern Polish city of Katowice.

A circular economy is one in which raw materials are used for as long as possible and innovation helps improve the quality of products and extend their shelf life, Emilewicz told an audience of officials, researchers and environmentalists gathered in the Polish national pavilion at the COP24 conference.

“After all, what we want is for there to be less waste,"" she said at the discussion, entitled “Circular Economy and Climate Change: Poland’s Contribution to the Implementation of the Paris Agreement,” during the climate summit’s Innovation Day on Wednesday.

Poland’s Deputy Environment Minister Sławomir Mazurek seconded that a move toward a circular economy would ensure greater success in reducing hazardous emissions.

Thousands of decision makers from around the world have flocked to Katowice for the UN climate change conference, which opened on Monday.

The 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, also known as COP24, runs in the southern Polish mining city until December 14.

The summit aims to adopt a roadmap for putting into practice the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which seeks to slow climate change, public broadcaster Polish Radio has reported.

Speaking at the official opening of the summit on Monday, Polish President Andrzej Duda said his country was ""ready to take its share of responsibility for international security,"" including in terms of climate policy.

Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told international leaders on Tuesday that his country was among nations leading the way in efforts to stop global warming.

362,Labor Announces Plan To Outlaw Single Use Plastic Bags In Australia By 2021,"The federal Labor party have today announced a plan that will see lightweight single use plastic bags and microbeads outlawed in Australia by 2021, as part of a series of environmental policies.

The plan represents a bid to reduce the amount of waste generated by Australians and protect wildlife, and is part of a proposed $290 million spend to clean up the country for future generations.

In a joint announcement today, Labor leader Bill Shorten, senators Penny Wong and Kim Carr and environment spokesman Tony Burke said:

“Australians want action from government to help reduce waste and build a circular economy. So while many Australians do their duty – they recycle, compost, use keep cups for their morning coffee – we need the government to take a leading role to tackle some of the big, structural problems.”

If Labor wins at the next federal election, it will consult with state and territory governments, many of whom have already moved to phase out single use plastic bags, on how to introduce the ban.

In 2018, major supermarket chains Coles and Woolworths voluntarily phased out lightweight single use plastic bags in their stores across the country, and were joined by many other retailers.

Lightweight bags are currently outlawed in all states and territories except for Victoria, which is set to ban them by the end of next year, and New South Wales.

Microbeads, small plastic particles which are typically used in exfoliating and other cosmetics products, were subject to a voluntary industry phase-out, the cutoff date for which was July 2018.

As of early last year, 80% of cosmetics companies operating in Australia had phased them out, with the remaining 20% reformulating their products to meet the July cutoff date.

As such, Labor’s bid seems like more of a plan to solidify a process that’s already underway, but a nationwide ban on such plastic products will help ensure that nothing slips through the cracks.

Other planned environmental initiatives include a commitment of $15 million to assist neighbouring Pacific nations in cleaning up plastic waste from the ocean.",Tuvalu,2019.03
389,EU Parliament to ban single-use plastics products,"The European Parliament recently agreed on the ambitious measures proposed by the Commission to tackle marine litter coming from the 10 single-use plastic products most often found on European beaches, as well as abandoned fishing gear and oxo-degradable plastics.

The rules on Single-Use Plastics items and fishing gear, addressing the ten most found items on EU beaches place the EU at the forefront of the global fight against marine litter. They are part of the EU Plastics Strategy – the most comprehensive strategy in the world adopting a material-specific lifecycle approach with the vision and objectives to have all plastic packaging placed on the EU market as reusable or recyclable by 2030. The Single-Use Plastics Directive adopted by the European Parliament on March 27 is an essential element of the Commission’s Circular Economy Action Plan as it stimulates the production and use of sustainable alternatives that avoid marine litter.

“Today we have taken an important step to reduce littering and plastic pollution in our oceans and seas. We got this, we can do this. Europe is setting new and ambitious standards, paving the way for the rest of the world,” First Vice-President Frans Timmermans, responsible for sustainable development said.

“Once implemented, the new rules will not only prevent plastic pollution, but also make the European Union the world leader in a more sustainable plastic policy. The European Parliament has played an essential role in laying the foundation for this transformation and in giving a chance to the industry to innovate, thus driving forward our circular economy,” Vice-President Jyrki Katainen, responsible for jobs, growth, investment and competitiveness, added.

“We should all be very proud of these new rules because they tackle marine plastic pollution at its source – one of the most called for and supported EU initiatives among European citizens. After the favourable vote by the Parliament today, our main task will be to ensure that these ambitious measures are quickly implemented in practice, which will be common work for public authorities, producers and consumers alike,” Commissioner for environment, maritime affairs and fisheries, Karmenu Vella concluded.

The Single-Use Plastics Directive voted on by the European Parliament tackles directly marine litter thanks to a set of ambitious measures:
• A ban on selected single-use products made of plastic for which alternatives exist on the market: cotton bud sticks, cutlery, plates, straws, stirrers, sticks for balloons, as well as cups, food and beverage containers made of expanded polystyrene and on all products made of oxo-degradable plastic.
• Measures to reduce consumption of food containers and beverage cups made of plastic and specific marking and labelling of certain products.
• Extended Producer Responsibility schemes covering the cost to clean-up litter, applied to products such as tobacco filters and fishing gear.
• A 90% separate collection target for plastic bottles by 2029 (77% by 2025) and the introduction of design requirements to connect caps to bottles, as well as target to incorporate 25% of recycled plastic in PET bottles as from 2025 and 30% in all plastic bottles as from 2030.

The proposed Directive follows a similar approach to the successful 2015 Plastic Bags Directive, which brought about a rapid shift in consumer behaviour. When implemented the new measures will bring about both environmental and economic benefits, such as for example: avoid the emission of 3.4 million tons of CO equivalent; avoid environmental damages which would cost the equivalent of EUR 22 billion by 2030; save consumers a projected EUR 6.5 billion.

Following this approval by the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers will finalise the formal adoption. This endorsement will be followed by the publication of the texts in the Official Journal of the Union. The Member States will then have two years to transpose the legislation into their national law.",Romania,2019.03

562,Disassembly and deconstruction analytics system (D-DAS) for construction in a circular economy,"Despite the relevance of building information modelling for simulating building performance at various life cycle stages, Its use for assessing the end-of-life impacts is not a common practice. Even though the global sustainability and circular economy agendas require that buildings must have minimal impact on the environment across the entire lifecycle. In this study therefore, a disassembly and deconstruction analytics system is developed to provide buildings’ end-of-life performance assessment from the design stage. The system architecture builds on the existing building information modelling capabilities in managing building design and construction process. The architecture is made up of four different layers namely (i) Data storage layer, (ii) Semantic layer, (iii) Analytics and functional models layer and (iv) Application layer. The four layers are logically connected to function as a single system. Three key functionalities of the disassembly and deconstruction analytics system namely (i) Building Whole Life Performance Analytics (ii) Building Element Deconstruction Analytics and (iii) Design for Deconstruction Advisor are implemented as plug-in in Revit 2017. Three scenarios of a case study building design were used to test and evaluate the performance of the system. The results show that building information modelling software capabilities can be extended to provide a platform for assessing the performance of building designs in respect of the circular economy principle of keeping the embodied energy of materials perpetually in an economy. The disassembly and deconstruction analytics system would ensure that buildings are designed with design for disassembly and deconstruction principles that guarantee efficient materials recovery in mind. The disassembly and deconstruction analytics tool could also serve as a decision support platform that government and planners can use to evaluate the level of compliance of building designs to circular economy and sustainability requirements.",N/A,2019.03

618,‘Circular economy’ could save GCC cities $138bn over a decade,"By minimising waste and making the most of resources through a circular economy, GCC cities could save $138 billion (Dh507 billion) and 148 million tonnes of C02 emissions between 2020 and 2030, according to the managing director at Strategy&, Middle East.

Speaking at the London Business School Middle East conference in west London on Friday, George Sarraf said: “There is a population growth in the Middle East that is very much concentrated in the cities. The focal point of the economy is very much skewed to very few cities and at the same time, those cities are generating a huge amount of waste and inefficiencies.”

A circular economy is one that focuses on a regenerative approach to achieve cost savings, through recycling and repairing.

“We have benchmarked factors like electricity consumption, water consumption and level of recycling across different cities and the numbers for the Middle East are quite concerning in some aspects,” he said.

This has been driven by policies that have been in place for a long time that either made resources too cheap or did not prioritise efficiency.

Strategy&, the consulting team at accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, reviewed a sample of 330 cities and looked at how to optimise resources, improve recycling and streamline manufacturing to save costs.

The model looked at three elements: built environment, mobility and community. Built environment covers housing and commercial infrastructure, mobility covers public transport, personal cars and traffic; community includes housing infrastructure, electricity and water and recycling.

Mr Sarraf also compared green field and brown field infrastructure products – whether new buildings are built on new land or land where there is existing infrastructure. The Strategy& executive said it will initially be easier to implement a circular economy in green field infrastructure projects, as there are no existing buildings or policies in place. He adds that resources like electricity and water will equally impact both brown field and green field projects, because their policy is determined on national level.”

Mega cities planned in the region, such as Duqm in Oman and Neom in Saudi Arabia, could also present opportunities to strengthen the economy, says the executive.

Speaking to The National on the sidelines of the conference, Junaid Iqbal, managing director at ride hailing app Careem, said that in mega cities, the business “needs serve every price point” and branch out of normal taxi services.

In some of the larger cities, like Karachi or Cairo, 25% of Careem’s revenues come coming from bike riding services. In Cairo, a significant amount of Careem’s revenues come from working with bus businesses too.

“When you look at megacities, you have to solve for everything,” he said. “If you go from neighbourhood to neighbourhood, there will be neighbourhoods in Karachi in Pakistan that look like the first world and others that look truly third world.”

“Being a technology player, you have to be the one that bridges that gap between them and all and is agnostic to income levels. You try and design your service so that it can help the economic process for all.”",United Arab Emirates,2019.03

Amerplast’s ESSI Kiertokääre is a circular economy packaging concept that utilizes recycled plastic from industrial sources and post-consumer recycled plastic packaging separately collected from Finnish households. According to Amerplast research the use of recycled raw materials decreases the environmental effects of packaging and also the need for virgin raw materials.

Serla’s Green Pack packaging unique is a combination of both the ESSI Kiertokääre concept and biobased Green PE polyethylene. Green PE is produced using ethanol, a by-product in sugar production. It contains no fossil raw materials and can be recycled in existing recycling streams. Sugar cane is a 100% renewable and carbon dioxide depleting resource. It removes up to 2.15 metric tons of CO2 from the atmosphere for each ton produced, from cradle to the supplier Braskem’s gate (source: LCA study by E4tech & LCA Works).

828,European bank funds solid waste facility in Çanakkale - Latest News,"The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is providing a 57.5 million Turkish Lira loan (9 million euros) for waste management.

The 200,000-strong population of Çanakkale will benefit from an the for the development of a modern, efficient and sustainable waste management under a private-public partnership scheme in this historical province, the development bank said in a statement.

Çanakkale province, which stands on the Dardanelles Strait connecting the Sea of Marmara and the Aegean, is the location of ancient Troy.

The EBRD loan will be extended to a local venture between the French utility SUEZ Group and the Turkish waste management firm ALTAŞ.

The two partners have won the international tender to provide waste collection, transportation, recycling and disposal services under 29-year concession in five towns: Çanakkale, Lapseki, Kepez, Çardak and Umurbey.

The consortium is contributing 38.3 million liras of its own funds to the project.

The EBRD loan will finance the construction of a mechanical biological treatment plant which combines a sorting facility with biological treatment such as composting and producing energy from waste. The funds will also be used to refurbish a landfill and upgrade a plant that treats leachate, a water-polluting liquid.

The project will help reduce the amount of solid waste sent to landfill, extend the landfill lifetime by 20 years and increase waste recycling, in line with EU standards. The new approach is based on circular economy and will minimise the negative effects of waste on the environment and people.

Nandita Parshad, EBRD Managing Director for Sustainable Infrastructure, said during a visit to

Turkey: “At the EBRD we are strong supporters of public-private partnerships as an effective tool to deliver better services. Together with our partners from SUEZ we aim to demonstrate how effective waste management by private companies can benefit people and the environment.”

With 90 000 people on the five continents, SUEZ is a world leader providing water and waste management solutions. The Group recovers 17 million tons of waste a year, produces 3.9 million tons of secondary raw materials and 7 TWh of local renewable energy. It also secures water resources and wastewater treatment. SUEZ generated total revenues of 17.3 billion euros in 2018.

ALTAŞ provides solid waste management services in the Turkish cities of Izmir, Istanbul, Ankara and Mersin and is also active in the Lebanese capital Beirut.

The EBRD is a leading institutional investor in Turkey and has invested over 11 billion euros in 283 projects in the country since 2009.

The overwhelming majority of EBRD investments in Turkey are in the private sector. One half of the bank’s portfolio in Turkey constitutes investments that promote sustainable energy and resource use.",Turkey,2019.06
834,How camel waste is fuelling the UAE's circular economy,"On a good day, Mlah the camel produces 10 kilogrammes of manure.

This makes her an essential contributor to the UAE’s burgeoning circular economy.

In Ras Al Khaimah, the government has tied two of its biggest industries in an unlikely partnership to cut carbon emissions. Every day, more than 50 tonnes of camel manure are used as fuel in cement production.

“When we started to make an estimate, people wouldn’t believe me,” said Sonia Nasser, the executive director of the waste management agency at the RAK Public Works and Services Department. “But the first thing in creating a circular economy is, what do I have that I’m throwing away?”

The central premise of the circular economy is to minimise waste and make the most of resources.

Ras Al Khaimah had camel waste - and lots of it.

The emirate is home to roughly 9,000 camels and each produces about eight to 10 kilogrammes a day.

Instead of dumping it, the government began a programme last May to process it and give it to local cement factories as fuel.

The camel population has grown exponentially since the rise of the camel racing industry. Camels produce far more waste than farmers use to fertilise palm orchards. The excess manure was going to the landfill. When Ms Nasser suggested the programme, camel farmers were immediately supportive.

“If the government says it is a good idea and keeps things clean, then it is a good idea,” said Mlah’s owner, Saeed Al Masafari.

For cement companies, it cut costs and carbon emissions. But it took some convincing.

“When we approached people 10 years ago with alternative fuels, nobody wanted to touch it because people are very protective of the [cement production] process and the quality,” said Ms Nasser. “You really have to have a process engineer who is open minded.”

The project began in May 2018, and more than 10,000 tonnes from 6,000 camels have been diverted so far this year.

Farmers bring manure to four collection stations where it bakes in the sun. From there, the manure is taken north to Gulf Cement Company in the town of Khor Khair.

This has saved an estimated 18,000 tonnes of carbon emissions, and cut costs.

To make cement, ovens must burn at 1,400 degrees, 24 hours a day. More than 70 per cent of Gulf Cement’s production costs are heat and power. With so much energy required, cement production is one of the country’s main contributors to carbon emission.

Dried camel manure has about half the calorific value of coal, so a tonne of camel manure replaces half a tonne of coal.

“When we were introduced it had a good calorific value but the question was, how to use it and where to use it?” said Tiruneveli Palanikumar, the head of Gulf Cement’s business development.

After some experimentation, they found they it worked best mixed with coal as boiler fuel. About 8 to 10 per cent of coal is substituted with camel waste.

“Cement production is a natural incinerator,” said Mr Palanikumar. “Most of the waste we can burn. I need about 1,500 metric tonnes of fossil fuel every day. When I’m using so much fuel, 10 per cent is not a big issue.”

Similar programmes could be applied to other animals. After all, Ras Al Khaimah has more livestock than people. In addition to its camels, there are more than 317,000 goats, 81,000 sheep and 5,000 cattle.

Following the success of Gulf Cement, other cement factories want to use camel fuel and RAK hopes to expand the manure fuel project to other Emirates. There are 14 cement plants in the UAE and six are in Ras Al Khaimah. About 13,000 tonnes of coal is burned in the Northern Emirates every day.

“If you can stop using this amount of coal, there’s a whole carbon emissions trial that we’re reducing,” said Ms Nasser. “Coal is coming and being shipped all the way from South Africa to Ras al Khaimah.”

Other waste like clothing, agricultural waste and dry sludge could be alternative fuels.

Some cement factories are already substituting coal with carbon dust, a byproduct from the aluminum industry and Star Cement substitutes 10 per cent of its fuel with tyre chips.

“When people have strange materials, we call the cement factories,” said Ms Nasser. “Does it have calorific value? Instead of trying to landfill it, can we incinerate it? There’s a lot you can get rid of.”

It is part of the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment strategy to develop a circular economy and turn waste into a resource.

By 2020, all coal-burning cement factories must use local municipal, commercial and industrial waste for at least 10 per cent of total energy needs.",United Arab Emirates,2019.06

890,16 international students will study innovation in the circular economy in Slovenia and northern Italy - UP FAMNIT,"16 international students will study innovation in the circular economy in Slovenia and northern Italy

Last Monday, the third edition of Alpine Europe Summer School, which is organized every two years by the University of Primorska and the Oregon State University (USA), has started. In the next two weeks, 16 students from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czech Republic, India, Kazakhstan and the USA will study the sustainability and creation of the built environment, starting in the forest itself and following the value chain all the way through design, manufacturing and construction. Their goal is to provide not only concept and content, but to also facilitate interactions between, and learning among students coming from different countries.

The international group of participants will visit numerous companies and institutions in Slovenia and northern Italy that are focusing on sustainable products from natural materials in their production and design. From 22nd to 24th June they will also enjoy the sea breeze on the Slovenian Littoral.

After first day staying in Ljubljana, their next stops are Gozd Martuljek and Bled, where they will visit the eco-tourist green resort Garden Village. The following day they will continue their tour to the company Riko hiše in Ribnica, which produces ecological wooden prefabricated buildings. On the fourth day, they will go to M Sora in Žiri, where windows exclusively from domestic wood are produced, and in the afternoon they will reach the seaside.

On Friday, the day will start in Korte with a visit to the Logotowood family company, which manually manufactures wooden washbasins and unique furniture. After that it will be time to stop at the University of Primorska, more precisely at UP FAMNIT for a more relaxed meeting with students and the visit to InnoRenew CoE.

After Saturday’s visit to the Olive oil Factory Krožera Franca Marzi in Srgaši and to the Škocjanski zatok Nature Reserve, they will move to the north-west of Slovenia, where they will learn about the characteristics of Bovec and Kobarid. They will also visit the Kobarid Museum, which is dedicated to the events during the First World War on the Isonzo Front. In the mountain region there will be time for discovering the local cheese and have some active time along and in the Soča river.

Next Tuesday, it will be time to jump across the border to Italy. Cortina, Bressanone and Bolzano will be the next stops, while the summer school will end in Venice.

Last year, the University of Primorska, in cooperation with the Oregon State University, have organized the isMCS summer school (which can be found here), which will be hopefully organized also next year.

We wish to all participants a lot of curiosity, interesting discoveries and especially beautiful moments in our country.",Slovenia,2019.06
906,Circular Economy Bachelors Course to Be Offered for the First Time in Georgia,"Global society is at an environmental breaking point. Modern production and consumption practices have severely degraded our water, air, and soil resources, and our rate of fossil fuel extraction and emission puts society on track for catastrophic climate change. It has been projected that at our current rate of plastic consumption, by 2050 there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish (by weight). To help mitigate these environmental problems, some are calling for a redesign of the system that lies at their root, the linear economy, in favor of a more circular alternative.

Under the linear consumption economy, also referred to as the “take, make, waste” system, products are only designed for a limited lifespan and then disposed of. This applies to not only single-use products, like plastic straws and paper towels, but also to more expensive goods like clothing, smartphones, and furniture. A circular economy aims to eliminate material and energy waste by prioritizing systems of reuse, repair, and recycling.

Starting September 2019, students at the International School of Economics at Tbilisi State University (ISET) will have the opportunity to explore the principles of the circular economy and learn how business can put this framework into action. This material will be offered in a new course, “Circular Economy”, developed by International Expert Hans Wiesmeth in partnership with the USAID-funded Waste Management Technologies in the Regions (WMTR II) program implemented by CENN and ISET. The course will be launched shortly and be taught in the third year of the BA program for the duration of one academic semester.

To learn more about the circular economy concept, GEORGIA TODAY spoke with economist Dr. Hans Wiesmeth, a professor at the Technical University of Dresden, who helped develop the curriculum for the “Circular Economy” course at ISET, the Executive Director of CENN, Nana Janashia, and the Director of ISET, Dr. Tamar Sulukhia.

What is the circular economy and how does it differ from the linear economy?

Hans: The Ellen MacArthur Foundation provides one of the most prominent definitions of a circular economy: “A circular economy is an industrial system that is restorative or regenerative by intention and design. It replaces the ‘end-of-life’ concept with restoration, shifts towards the use of renewable energy, eliminates the use of toxic chemicals, which impair reuse, and aims for the elimination of waste through the superior design of materials, products, systems, and, within this, business models”. In particular, a circular economy aims to prevent waste, as “products are designed and optimized for a cycle of disassembly and reuse”. Consequently – and very importantly – a circular economy requires a “new thinking” in all parts of a society.

This is in contrast to the traditional linear economy, which is characterized as a “throughput economy”, a take, make and dispose economy based on the use of fossil fuels.

Why is the circular economy concept important?

Hans: Because of the gradually changing framework conditions for our economic and social systems, it’s becoming increasingly important to switch from a linear economy to a circular one. Otherwise, we risk depleting life supporting environmental resources with possibly disastrous consequences for the life of many people on earth.

WHAT WAS YOUR ROLE WORKING IN GEORGIA WITH CENN AND ISET?

Hans: I have been teaching “Environmental Economics and Policy” at ISET since 2008. I am happy that I got in contact with CENN in recent years. CENN provided support for discussing issues in waste management with important people from the public administration of Georgia, in particular the Ministry for the Environment. Moreover, I was able to develop a textbook on the circular economy to be used for teaching this important field in Georgian universities. Consequently, both institutions are very helpful for disseminating the concept of a circular economy in the countries of the South Caucasus.

Why and how did ISET become interested in the circular economy concept?

Tamar: With the high pace of urbanization and economic growth, the environmental footprint of Georgia’s economy is expanding and deepening. The need for action is evident and is further exacerbated by the impacts of climate change globally and locally. Many governments across the globe, including in Georgia, are increasingly realizing the need for proactive policies to green the economy and deal with severe impacts of climate change through mainstreaming adaptation and mitigation agenda in their national policies. Joint actions by policy-makers, business, civil society and citizens are required to soften the environmental footprint and use every opportunity towards efficient use of the country’s (and global) resources. Equipping the next generation of young professionals and future policy-makers with the right knowledge and skillset is an important part of this critical global and national agenda.

ISET has had integrated Environmental Economics in its Masters in Economics program curriculum since 2009 and it is taught by the visiting professor from Technical University Dresden (Germany) Dr. Hans Wiesmeth. A number of ISET alumni who have taken the course are employed by the Ministry of Environment and Agriculture, other public institutions and NGOs involved in design and implementation of environmental policies.

In 2017, USAID Waste Management Technologies in the Regions (WMTR) Project implemented by CENN hired Professor Wiesmeth to assist the Government of Georgia in designing and implementing the policy on extended producer responsibility (EPR). Professor Wiesmeth was closely collaborating with ISET Policy Institute researchers in delivering on this important task. This created a fruitful partnership and strong bonds between ISET and CENN. Through close collaboration and synergies with CENN on the circularity in the economics of environmental resources, CENN and ISET recently agreed to work with professor Wiesmeth further in expanding learning opportunities and strengthening skillsets for future economists in Georgia and beyond.

What purpose does the course serve? What kind of qualifications or professional directions can this lead the students to?

Tamar: The aim of the course is to teach students how to use tools of economic theory to analyze the use of environmental resources from the viewpoint of efficiency and sustainability. Studying the use of environmental resources across the value chain of production helps to better understand how to reduce (R) the environmental footprint, reuse (R) the resources already utilized for production and recycle (R) the products that can create precious resources. This summarizes the principle of the three Rs, that are the cornerstone of the circular economy. The course will equip students interested in environmental policy with knowledge of economic instruments for resource management and help them more easily identify costs and benefits associated with decisions. These skills are currently lacking both in Georgian public service and among civil society organizations, thus this knowledge will equip students with very much needed skills for interesting and highly impactful job opportunities. For more entrepreneurially-minded students, the course will go through the value chain of different resource uses and help them identify possible business opportunities that can arise from the approach of environmental protection.

How are you working with the education sector to promulgate the concept of ‘circular economy’?

Nana: We realized that in Georgia, there was a substantial deficit in specialization and professional workforce in circular economy, whether in practice or theory. For us, the most important goal is to make sure we can establish a system that doesn’t compromise the environment and our health, and above all, that can be sustained. Therefore, investing in education and creating a platform to support professions and workforce development was absolutely essential.

We decided to start working with educational institutions and support them in introducing a circular economy course into their curricula. We are working with the education sector intensively via various thematic seminars, trainings, competitions, camps, etc.

CENN, through its USAID WMTR II program, decided to take advantage of the country’s willingness to introduce circular economy approaches. It is essential to have specialists with a sufficient background in circular economy that can support the country in transitioning from a linear economy to a circular. These experts will provide their knowledge and support at the decision-making level as well as at the implementation level.

How was the syllabus developed?

Nana: We decided to introduce a circular economy course in the curricula of educational institutions and involve international expertise in this process. The USAID WMTR II program involved an international expert from Dresden University to develop syllabus along with relevant textbooks on the circular economy concept and, in addition, to conduct a training for the university lecturers. In March 2019, an intensive training was conducted on this topic and shortly afterwards the USAID WMTR II program worked intensively with ISET to support them in incorporating the circular economy course into their curriculum. We are very happy that this cooperation was possible and starting September 2019, ISET will offer this new course to its students. With the support of USAID WMTR II program, Hans Wiesmeth will be teaching the course during its first phase.",Georgia,2019.06
929,EU and ASEAN commit towards a circular economy for plastics in the ASEAN Region,"Kuala Lumpur, 12 June 2019: The two-day EU-ASEAN regional workshop on circular economy took place in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from 11 to 12 June 2019. The workshop, conducted back- to-back with the European Commission DG Environment Circular Economy Mission to Malaysia, emphasised the importance of collaboration between the EU and ASEAN towards a circular economy, and contributed to the EU-ASEAN High-Level Dialogue on Environment and Climate Change. Joint Opening Remarks of the EU-Malaysia Conference on circular economy and the EU-ASEAN regional workshop on circular economy were delivered by Mr. Daniel Calleja Crespo, European Commission Director-General for Environment, and Minister YB Yeo Bee Yin for Energy, Science, Technology, Environment, and Climate Change, Malaysia. The workshop served as an opportunity for the EU and ASEAN to reaffirm their commitment to strengthen cooperation on regional and global environmental challenges.

“Circular economy is not just another environment policy, it is not just another climate policy, and it is not another trade policy either. It’s all that and more – a truly cross-sectoral effort, built around people’s needs, and built together with industries and companies like you.” said Director-General for Environment, Daniel Calleja Crespo.

Minister YB Yeo Bee Yin underlined that “it is important whenever we talk about circular economy, we cannot put the system boundary to the national level – it is the global circular economy to be taken into account, and concrete global actions need to be undertaken.” Addressing the public and private sector, she added, “While governments need to provide incentives and support ‘replacement’ as 4th R (reduce, reuse, recycle, replace), it is up to the private sector to introduce innovative solutions, or otherwise facing the consequence of being left behind.”

Plastic, identified as a key priority in the European Commission Action Plan on Circular Economy, if facilitated and driven by enabling policy frameworks, has the potential to bring new opportunities for innovation, boost countries’ competitiveness, and create new jobs. A world-wide problem, waste and pollution harm ecosystems and fisheries, fill up landfills, clog urban water systems, contribute to global warming, and have negative impacts on human health. As a hotspot for these issues, Southeast Asia’s contribution to plastic pollution of the oceans over the last years has steadily increased. Tackling the problem by addressing changes in policy and legislation on plastics are seen as the most efficient ways to bring solutions. With a longstanding experience on waste management and circular economy, in its recently adopted Plastics Strategy, the European Union has committed to assist other regions in shifting towards a circular economy for plastics. Both regions, ASEAN and the EU, have jointly agreed to collaborate in tackling these issues and bringing solution to the problems.

Under this collaboration framework, the EU and ASEAN Secretariat launched a regional gap-analysis on the state of circular economy for plastics in ASEAN Member States. The analysis, conducted by a team of experts from the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) with support from the EU, developed a knowledge base for follow-up actions by the EU to inspire and assist circular economy approaches to plastic issues in the ASEAN region. The importance of facilitating the negotiation of a regional framework agreement and the development of regional circular economy guidelines for plastic pollution, followed by the support to develop technical standards for plastics, recycled plastics, and products made of plastics, were among the main findings presented during this two-day workshop. Overall the findings highlighted the main conclusions from all ten ASEAN Member States, while presenting the EU policy and legislation related to plastics, plastic waste and its promotion of use, and plastic waste regulations. With high participation from EU and ASEAN public and private sector, as well as civil society organisations, the workshop created opportunities for multi-stakeholder engagement in plastic waste management and minimisation, while providing room for discussion on what shall be achieved at the regional level.

Forward looking, the sectoral dialogue on circular economy with ASEAN will be further enhanced through sharing of EU experiences on waste, circular economy and plastic strategy in alignment with the upcoming Partnership Instrument project on marine litter, and in advising interested ASEAN Member States on changes in policy and legislation on plastics, plastic waste and single use plastics.

The workshop was supported by the Enhanced Regional EU-ASEAN Dialogue Instrument (E-READI), a development cooperation program that facilitates dialogues between the EU and ASEAN in priority policy areas of joint interest. Drawing on the EU’s experience of regional integration, the E-READI policy dialogue facility further strengthens both the ASEAN regional integration process as well as the overall ASEAN-EU partnership.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was established on 8 August 1967. The Member States of the Association are Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam. On 31 December 2015, the ASEAN Community was formally established. The ASEAN Secretariat is based in Jakarta.

102,How the circular economy can help save the planet – and the UAE,"A person buys a bottle of water, drinks it and throws the plastic away.

The bottle will take hundreds of years to degrade, polluting the earth, endangering our health and imperiling wildlife.

But what if there was another way? A path that cut single-use plastics, ended mindless consumption and tackled climate change. Enter the circular economy – a fresh way of thinking that promotes reuse, repair and recycling and even creates jobs. A World Economic Forum report from a few years ago even claimed it could generate 100,000 new jobs within five years.

Lofty goals, then. But the circular economy is centre stage at the moment in Finland. The three-day World Circular Economy Forum has brought together more than 2,000 green thinkers from across the globe.

“We are trying to change society,” said Hannele Pokka from the Finnish Ministry of Environment. “In the circular economy nothing is wasted. But to do this many things must change.”

The choice of Finland as hosts is no accident. It was the Finns who in 2016 published the world’s first national road map to a circular economy. Take the country’s forestry industry – a crucial sector employing tens of thousands of people. Effluent from its many paper mills once polluted Finland’s lakes, but now practically everything is reused.

Pine oil, once a wasted by-product, is now repurposed to make biofuel. Authorities have also managed to cut the 1,500 landfill sites the country had a few years ago to a few dozen through recycling and incinerating waste to generate power.

“Landfill as a term is going out of fashion,” said Ms Pokka. “We won’t need landfills at all within a few years.”

But it is not all rosy – Finland uses a lot of coal for heating. And individual households have much more to do to increase rates of recycling.

These challenges are relevant closer to home and efforts in the UAE to promote the circular economy are increasing. The UAE in April signed up to the World Economic Forum in the Middle East and North Africa’s Scale 360 initiative, which aims to shift countries towards a circular economy.

“We seek to promote Scale 360 … to ensure the conservation of resources, greater reliance on clean energy, the application of sustainable development standards and to create future opportunities for the youth,” said Thani Al Zeyoudi, Minister of Climate Change and Environment.

Just last year Abu Dhabi Municipality installed dedicated recycling depots across the city, while consumers are demanding more from business. Some hotels have now banned single use plastics, while a number of shops are encouraging customers to use refill stations for goods such as olive oil and pasta.

Bee’ah, the environmental management company based in Sharjah, has also been advocating the circular economy for some time. Writing in The National last year, its chief executive Khaled Al Huraimel said waste needed to be diverted from landfill and recycled. He also called for public awareness campaigns and more renewable energy.

“Our experience suggests that a willingness to adopt more sustainable ways of living already exists within the general population,” said Mr Al Huraimel. “It is therefore up to us and others in a similar position to harness and nurture that desire to do what is right for the environment, and ensure we convert it into positive action.”

Only a few months ago, it was suggested that GCC cities could save $138 billion (Dh507 billion) and 148 million tonnes of C02 emissions between 2020 and 2030 through the circular economy.

Many countries, then, have only just started on the path to a circular economy but the philosophy of reduce, reuse and recycle is a hard one to argue with.

“We have a lot to do,” said Ms Pokka. “But we are optimistic we can do it.”",United Arab Emirates,2019.06

193,Calculation and evaluation of circularity indicators for the built environment using the case studies of UMAR and Madaster,"Understanding buildings as material depots radically changes the way resources need to be managed within the construction industry and the built environment. Similar to warehousing, buildings, cities and regions will have to keep track and anticipate the stocks and flows of materials, needing to document and communicate (at the right moment) which materials in what quantities and qualities become available for re-use or recycling where and at what time in the future. This paper describes the process of documenting materials and products utilized in the construction of the Urban Mining and Recycling (UMAR) unit within the Madaster platform. UMAR is a fully circular residential unit of Empa NEST created from secondary resources and designed as a material depot for future constructions. Madaster is an online platform, which generates and registers materials passports and calculates a Circularity Indicator for their construction, use, and end-of-life phases. The results of the calculations show that the UMAR unit is 96% circular. Constructed from 95% non-virgin and rapidly renewable materials, the unit has a utility rate of 98% and 92% of its materials are prepared to return into pure-type material cycles at the unit’s end of life. In combination, these two case studies provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the capabilities of materials passports and the Madaster Circularity Indicator to document material stocks and flows within a circular built environment, and to assess the potential of circularity indicators as a design tool supporting the transition towards a circular construction industry. The continuous development of tools and systems for material cadastres undoubtedly represents a key prerequisite for the implementation of a paradigm shift towards a functioning circular construction industry.",N/A,2019.09
205,Transition to circular economy on firm level: Barrier identification and prioritization along the value chain,"This research paper is concerned with potential barriers to the transition to a circular economy business model (CEBM) on the firm-level. Using a case study in the electronics manufacturing industry, we identify and analyze barriers in terms of their impact along the value chain (VC) as well as the level of difficulty required to overcome them. This allows us to map barriers to managerial responsibilities, thus improving the organizational transition process. The key findings of this research are: (1) To scale up CEBM on the firm-level, additional changes need to be implemented next to the oft-cited and discussed changes towards a Product-Service-System (PSS) and reverse logistics. Based on literature research and our case study, we put forward an extensive list of 29 potential barriers. (2) As managerial and financial resources are limited, we also suggest a priority ranking for barriers. Specifically, we show that barriers should be prioritized along the dimensions of their organizational resistivity and their impact on the VC. Organizational resistivity refers to the estimated effort along managerial time, financial resources, and cultural resistance for change, while VC impact refers to the ability of the barrier to influence and re-direct product, parts, and material flows along the foreword and reverse supply chain. This type of barrier assessment is new to the literature. (3) We argue that the proposed method for barrier prioritization, which we term the Circular Economy Matrix, can be readily transferred to manufacturing firms in other industries. (4) Clustering the barriers along managerial responsibilities (sets of barriers) is shown to lead to a more efficient and effective transition, as gauged by incurred transaction costs.",N/A,2019.09
236,Circular economy model gradually becoming mainstream in Vietnam - VnExpress International,"The concept refers to an economic model aimed at eliminating waste and continual use of resources. It implies the creation of a closed system that reuses, shares, repairs, remakes and recycles, minimizing the use of resource inputs and the creation of waste, pollution and emissions.

The circular economy and green economy, important factors in sustainable development, featured prominently on the agenda at a recent national conference.

Vu Tien Loc, chairman of the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI), said sustainable development has become the mantra of the modern world and a foundation of the interaction between nations. It was a bridge linking humans with each other, and a passport to enter the global market, he said.

""Leaving a 'green footprint' on the global economic map is the trait of an ethical business. Free trade agreements such as CPTPP (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership) and EVFTA (EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement) are also designed based on this foundation.""

Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said at the conference he believed sustainable development was not only an urgent need but also an essential trend in social evolution. ""Essential means if you go against it, you will fail,"" the PM said.

Globally, leading corporations are gradually switching to a circular model. For instance, Swedish furniture company IKEA is committed to fully switching to the circular economy by 2030, while Lego aims to use vegan plastic and Carlsberg has improved its packaging to reduce the amount of plastic.

France’s Schneider Electric gets 12 percent of its revenues from the circular economy, and expects to save 100,000 tons of resources between 2018 and 2020, the conference heard.

With environmental concerns growing in the society, a switch to the circular economy model was prudent, said Do Thai Vuong, vice president of Unilever Vietnam.

Other speakers noted that in Vietnam, some banks and foreign companies were leading the way in embracing the green and circular economy models.

HDBank was mentioned as a typical provider of green credit in the country. Its lending to renewable energy projects has reached VND10 trillion ($430 million) this year and is expected to increase to VND16 trillion by 2020. As of August 31, its lending for solar energy projects was worth VND 9.8 trillion.

Le Ngoc Lam, deputy head of operations at the state-owned bank BIDV, proposed that the government initiates programs providing preferential credit for green projects, those that protect the environment and are energy efficient.

The central bank should direct banks on how to treat projects that adversely affect the environment, such as increasing loan interest rates, he said.

But a circular economy remains a new concept to Vietnamese enterprises, especially small and medium ones.

Nguyen Quang Vinh, general secretary of the VCCI and vice chairman of the VCCI's Sustainable Development Businesses Council, said this lack of familiarity not only risks causing a shortage of resources and price volatility, but would also affect a company's sustainable development.

PM Phuc said the government encourages adoption of the circular economy model in production and consumption to create a non-disposal economy model.

In 2016 the government had approved a national program on sustainable production and consumption but its impact has been limited.",Vietnam,2019.09

407,"Redefining growth, ‘Circular Economy’ gains traction globally | Daily FT","Neste Vice President and Research and Development Petri Lehmus with the visiting Asian journalists including Daily FT

By Charumini de Silva 



 in Helsinki, Finland



 Circular economy, which is essentially looking beyond the current ‘take-make-waste’ extractive industrial model and aims to redefine growth, focusing on positive society-wide benefits, is a new phenomenon that is gaining traction globally, with experts saying developing countries stand to benefit the most.

What is circular economy?



 Circular economy is the new paradigm for business, which aims for economic growth through new, sustainable business models. 



 It entails gradually decoupling economic activity from the consumption of finite resources and designing waste out of the system. Underpinned by a transition to renewable energy sources, the circular model builds economic, natural, and social capital. It is based on three principles, which includes design out waste and pollution, keep products and materials in use and regenerate natural systems. 



 Proponents of the circular economy suggest that a sustainable world does not mean a drop in the quality of life for consumers and can be achieved without loss of revenue or extra costs for manufacturers. The argument is that circular business models can be as profitable as linear models, allowing us to keep enjoying similar products and services.



 According to new Accenture research, the circular economy could generate $4.5 trillion worth of additional economic output by 2030. The research identifies circular business models that will help decouple economic growth from natural resource consumption, while driving greater competitiveness.



 The circular economy includes products, infrastructure, equipment and services, and applies to every industry sector. It includes ‘technical’ resources (metals, minerals, fossil resources) and ‘biological’ resources (food, fibres, timber).



 The circular economy can cover a broad scope; findings from the literature show that researchers have focused on different areas such as industrial applications with both product-oriented and services, practice and policies to better understand the limitations that the circular economy currently faces, strategic management for details of the circular economy and different outcomes such as potential re-use applications and waste management.



 Most schools of thought advocate a shift from fossil fuels to the use of renewable energy, and emphasise the role of diversity as a characteristic of resilient and sustainable systems. It includes discussion of the role of money and finance as part of the wider debate, and some of its pioneers have called for a revamp of economic performance measurement tools.



 One example of a circular economy model is the implementation of renting models in traditional ownership areas (e.g. electronics, clothes, furniture, and transportation). Through renting the same product to several clients, manufacturers can increase revenues per unit, thus decreasing the need to produce more to increase revenues. Recycling initiatives are often described as a circular economy and are likely to be the most widespread models.

Finland — great case study for circular economy



 Finland is a frontrunner in the field of circular economy as the country’s solution for a sustainable society with innovative solutions coming from extensive collaboration among public and private sectors. Finland has set a goal to be a circular economy leader by 2025. 



 For Finland, circular bioeconomy is a tool for achieving sustainable development, combatting climate change, saving natural resources, and improving the state of the environment. All while generating economic growth and jobs. According to estimates, the circular economy may contribute an annual added value of at least three billion euros to the Finnish economy by 2030. 



 Finland was also the first country in the world to release a national circular economy road map, outlining the way to sustainable well-being and successful carbon-neutral future. 



 The first World Circular Economy Forum (WCEF) was held in Helsinki in 2017. The ground-breaking event not only presented the world’s best circular economy solutions, but has also become an annual summit for the global circular economy community. In 2018 it was held in Yokohama, Japan.



 This year, the WCEF, where Daily FT was present along with select media from Asia, focused on a range of issues including: Acceleration of Circular Businesses and Investing in Circular Economy Businesses; The Circular Economy in Cities; Governance and Circular Economy Roadmaps; Plastics and a Circular Bioeconomy; The Circular Economy in Construction; Measuring Circularity and the Fair Use of Data; Education for the Circular Economy; The Circular Economy for Water; The Carbon-Neutral Industry in the Circular Economy; and Circularity in our Day-To-Day Lives.



 Finland is now carrying out practical circular economy experiments that are providing benefits across all sectors of business and society. Combining Finnish success in education and strong competences in digital solutions, Finland aims at offering unique solutions globally. 



 The United Nations environmental conference’s UNEA4 ministerial declaration in March emphasised the role of the circular economy as a tool for building sustainable consumption model and this is in part, is something WCEF responds to. The circular economy is also becoming a key topic for the G20 nations’ meetings held in Japan in June. The circular economy is now a core component both of the European Union’s 2050 Long-Term Strategy to achieve a climate-neutral Europe and of China’s five-year plans.

Sitra — A fund for the future



 Sitra, the Finnish Innovation Fund, was founded in 1967 as a part of the Bank of Finland, on the country’s 50th anniversary, has played a key role in establishing the circular economy concept in the country. It is an independent public foundation which operates directly under the supervision of the Finnish Parliament. Sitra functions both as a think tank and as an investment company.



 The Finnish Innovation Fund, Sitra’s operational independence has been further strengthened by its funding model. It is not answerable to the government in power and does not depend on the State budget; instead, its operations are funded with the profits of its endowment and the profits of its operations.



 According to law, the funds must be invested securely and in a profitable manner. The return from Sitra’s endowment averages at approximately Euro 30 million a year. Sitra invests in companies and startups to create new profitable business.



 Sitra was honoured as the world’s best public-sector actor in the circular economy in The Circulars Awards at the World Economic Forum in 2018 for its pioneering work to accelerate the world’s transition to a circular economy.



 “We aim to inspire and help people, companies and administrations to see the opportunities of the new low-carbon lifestyle and the business opportunities related to it. We work together to experiment and discover permanent, easy-to-use, intelligent and clean solutions,” Sitra Director Communication and Public Affairs Veera Heinonen told a group of journalists from Asia including Daily FT.



 According to Sitra, circular economy helps to redistribute global wealth equitably. In Finland, particularly in the public sector, many municipalities have taken voluntary, active steps towards a more sustainable future.

Champions of Finnish enterprises



 Among other organisations that are championing the circular economy in Finland includes both public and private institutions which include Environment Ministry, Helsinki Metropolitan Smart and Clean Foundation, Haaga-Helia, Smart and Clean, Helsinki Central Library Oodi, Sulapac, InfinitiedFiber, Amerplast and Neste. During the media study tour Daily FT witnessed how these companies strive towards circular economic sustainable future. 



 Haaga-Helia is the only university of applied sciences in Finland offering a minor study path in corporate responsibility. It is also signatory to the UN Principles for Responsible Management Education demonstrating its commitment to offering responsibility topics in business education. 



 “Circular economy has been a specific development area in the past two years during which Haaga-Helia has introduced a joint study path with two other metropolitan Universities of Applied Sciences on circular economy business models,” Haaga-Helia President and Adjunct Professor Dr. Teemu Kokko said. 



 Currently it is working together with 18 other Finnish Universities of Applied Sciences to introduce 235 credits worth of circular economy courses into joint offering by 2020. Circular economy is also a current topic in its corporate outreach and project work.



 Smart and Clean Foundation is a five-year ‘step-change’ project with 29 public and private partners from the Helsinki Metropolitan cities, businesses, universities, research institutions and State actors. 



 “Smart and Clean has an ambitious goal to develop accelerate and orchestrate concrete climate solutions that provide cities and urban citizens the opportunity to reduce their carbon footprint and to improve their quality of life,” Smart and Clean Executive Director Tiina Kaho said.



 The institution orchestrates multi-stakeholder ecosystems, which can lead the way in making the significant changes needed to improve the scale and speed of climate and circular solutions in areas such as housing and renovation, smart mobility solutions and the closed circle of plastics.



 One of the most fascinating concepts in Helsinki was its Central Library Oodi, which is a more than just a library. It is one of 37 branches of Helsinki City Library and part of the Helmet library network. The energy efficient library is an impressive calling card for Finnish architecture. 



 “Oodi functions as a living room for residents, located right at the heart of Helsinki. Its wide range of services and facilities has created new library landscape for Helsinki and Finland. The services are available to residents seven days a week, from early in the morning till late in the evening,” Helsinki City Library Director Katri Vanttienn said.



 Libraries’ duties in Finland are defined by the new Library Act which came into effect from 1 January 2017. The libraries help to promote and share knowledge through events such as providing access to materials, information and cultural contents, maintaining versatile and up-to-date collections, promoting reading and literature, providing information services, guidance and support in the acquisition and use of information and in versatile literacy skills, providing premises for learning, recreational activities, working, andcivic activities as well as promoting social and cultural dialogue.



 According to her as at end 2018 Finland has 854 public libraries with3,553 experts at service lending 34.5 million items ranging from 29 million books, 2.7 million audio records, 1.1 million movies and series, 62,000 magazines and periodicals, 87,000 e-books and 1.9 million new acquisitions. In 2018, over 50 million people have visited these libraries with 38 million has visited online. 



 Sulapac is a private company that has innovated a fully biodegradable and microplastic-free material which has the benefits of plastic without its waste problem. The firm has also introduced a patent-pending marine biodegradable straw made from sustainably sourced, renewable raw materials – wood and natural binders.



 “We are a company driven with a mission to save the world from plastic waste,” Sulpac Deputy CEO and Head of Marketing and Communications Antti Valtonen said.



 Infinited Fiber is another private company which is transforming waste into resources especially in the apparel sector to introduce sustainable fashion. 



 The company has created a technology that allows textile waste to be used over and over, preserving 100%. “The technology brings enormous social, environmental and economic impact to the textile value chain and everybody’s wardrobe,” Infinited Fiber CEO Petri Alava said.



 Amerplast is a flexible packaging company striving to grow together with its customers and to create a future of sustainable packaging and circular economy of plastics. “We believe what is good for the environment is good for business,” Amerplast Marketing and Communications Manager Laura Alisalo said. The company believes in continuing its journey of transforming the flexible packaging industry into an environmentally-sound business.



 Neste is the world’s largest producer of renewable diesel from waste and residue raw materials, introducing renewable solutions also to the aviation and plastic industries. “We are a company that creates sustainable solutions for transport, business and consumer needs,” Neste Vice President and Research and Development Petri Lehmus said. 



 Neste is the only company in the world to have already produced renewable fuels from over 10 different raw materials. In July 2018, the company announced it was exploring ways to introduce liquefied waste plastic as a future raw material for fuels, chemicals and new plastics. The firm has set a target to process over one million tons of waste plastic annually from 2030.



 Creating gourmet-level dishes from ‘waste to taste,’ Restaurant Loop became Finland’s first waste food restaurant. It is established by a non-profit association. “Our trucks pick up surplus food from supermarkets in the mornings and Loop’s team of chefs plans the day’s menu based on the available ingredients. The idea is to deliver high quality gourmet level meals which are also available for everyone,” Restaurant Loop Waste to Taste Managing Director Mirka Korkia-aho said. 



 The Waste to Taste team also get requests from farms to collect their excessive produce at a very low price or for free, without letting it go into waste. In addition to these companies which Daily FT was able to visit during the study tour, there are many world-class Finnish enterprises that have adopted circular economy approaches in their business already. Finland excels in various solutions from waste management and sustainable food to new material development. 



 During the study tour, journalists were also educated on how Finnish people sort their waste and recycle by visiting a home of a Finnish family. 



 In addition, a guided walk in the Nuuksio national park near Helsinki was also arranged to relax after and long day in the sauna Löyly including a dip in the lake.



 On the final day, the group experienced the clean nature and breathed the cleanest air in the world. It was reiterated that clean thinking runs in Finnish genes and sustainability is their second nature. The unique location shapes the way Finnish people think, work, and innovate, persistent long-term efforts, public and private sector collaboration, and cutting edge cleantech expertise were outlined as key factors to succeed in protecting nature.



 Canada will host World Circular Economy Forum 2020, where participants will learn how Canada’s unique circular solutions are making a global impact.

Lessons for Sri Lanka



 Although Western economies are in an advanced position, Sitra experts pointed out that developing countries were in a strong position to take advantage.



 Success now in embedding circular principles in industrial growth and infrastructural development strategies can help to ensure that the needs of growing and urbanising populations are met without risking rises in resource use, emissions and environmental pollution. For example, in adopting modular, adaptive and resilient design principles, the circular economy can help to deliver quality housing and infrastructure at low economic and environmental cost.



 “Developing countries are already global centres of production and are also set to become the global drivers of consumption. With enough investment and learnings from the other pioneering circular economies like Finland, developing countries can leapfrog developed countries in digital and material innovation to embed sustainable production and consumption at the heart of their economies,” they said. It was also revealed that countries like Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and Indonesia have started on this journey towards circular economy several years ago and are making a lot of progress. Thereby, a country like Sri Lanka can harness all these experiences, learnings and know-how and do it much better.



 However, this requires going beyond just classifying and sorting of garbage. The private sector needs to address this from production levels, similar to the practices adopted by most Finnish enterprises, and get public sector support as well. In addition, the academia and universities must also partner this dialogue, in designing policies and knowledge and skills development.",Sri Lanka,2019.09
425,What is a circular economy and how is Sharjah taking the lead?,"Last week, I watched with keen interest as the young environmental activist, Greta Thunberg, arrived in New York after sailing across the Atlantic in a zero-carbon yacht. The Swedish teenager, who has galvanised support among young people across the world, will attend a UN summit on zero emissions, where she will issue a call for world leaders to do more to tackle the great environmental challenges we face.

I applaud her message that the world needs to act right now to reduce carbon emissions before it is too late. But the reality is there are many challenges on the path to creating a sustainable economy. How do we use our resources in a smarter way? How do we ensure economic prosperity but also create a greener future for our children? We must address this issue from multiple angles.

The key to this sustainable future is the creation of a ‘circular economy’. By creating a resource loop where nothing goes to waste, we are extending the lifespan of resources and their economic value while sustaining growth by turning used resources into new income streams.

Apart from reducing the depletion of resources and generating revenue in new ways, a circular economy has a number of other benefits. It plays an essential role in meeting the urgent requirement of reducing our overall carbon footprint. It creates significant opportunities for investment, if we are early adopters and developers of revolutionary breakthroughs in sustainable innovation. It enables the creation of strategic partnerships between government and non-government entities to build sustainable alternatives to present forms of production and consumption. And it allows for the diversification of the economy and investment from foreign entities. This enhances our natural wealth and ensures social being, in addition to increasing jobs at all skill levels.

At Bee’ah, the UAE's leading integrated environmental, recycling and waste management company, our aim is to ensure a sustainable, technology-driven future through creative and resourceful solutions. This goal is in alignment with our governments in this region, who have the vision and foresight to address the need for a sustainable future. With the introduction of initiatives like the UAE Vision 2021, the UAE Green Agenda 2015-2030 and the UAE energy Strategy 2050, there have been great efforts towards implementing a green economy in the UAE. Beyond the UAE, we also have great admiration for Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 goals.

Bee-ah’s approach to a circular economy began in 2007 with the goal of implementing a zero-waste to landfill strategy. Since then, we have tripled the diversion rates in Sharjah and we have now achieved 76 per cent diversion, the highest in the Middle East. We are now leaders in waste management. Through our technological innovations, together with an eco-friendly fleet of 1,200 vehicles, we are serving iconic landmarks across the UAE like the Burj Khalifa. Using a digitilsation solution such as our Bee’ah Waste Management System built on the SAP Prologa platform, we have reduced the number of vehicles used and the number of waste collection trips, even while increasing tonnage. All these features, in turn, save time, effort, resources and manpower.

As the first fully integrated waste management company in the UAE, we undertake everything from collection to disposal. We collect around three million tonnes of waste annually. This waste is brought to our transfer station and sorted, before being sent to our recycling facilities for processing. Through these facilities, we convert end-of-life products into recycled raw materials and products such as rubber tiles and concrete aggregates.

These hi-tech processes not only re-use precious resources, but also create a diverse revenue generation model, which is improving the future resource security of our community.

The notion of a circular economy would be impossible without clean energy sources. This requires disruptive technologies and disruptive thinking. That is why we have partnered with Masdar to form the Emirates Waste to Energy Company, which will establish waste-to-energy facilities across Mena. We have already started work on the UAE’s first waste to energy plant which is being built within our waste management complex in Sharjah. This facility will process more than 300,000 tonnes of municipal solid waste each year, produce around 30 MW of energy, and it will be able to power up to 28,000 homes. This development will help us to achieve the Middle East’s first zero-waste solution in Sharjah by 2021.

Of course, creating a circular economy also requires us to think deeply about how we integrate new technologies into our daily lives. Last year, we launched the region's first sustainable transport company, ION, in partnership with Crescent Enterprises, to help foster radical transport solutions for the future and reduce air pollution for the benefit of all citizens. ION sources electric vehicles and integrates them into existing infrastructure, like ride-hailing platforms, so people will always have the option of selecting eco-friendly alternatives in transportation.

While shifting to fuel-efficient and electric cars can help us in reducing our carbon footprint, technology can also play a pivotal role in making our activities even more sustainable. And by using smart bins and state-of-the-art route optimisation technology, we are streamlining our operations further, reducing carbon emissions, fuel consumption, time, manpower and vehicle usage.

This week, we will showcase our innovations in clean energy and pioneering waste-to-energy technologies at the 24th World Energy Congress, which is being held in the UAE for the first time. Two of our joint venture entities, ION and Emirates Waste to Energy Company (EWTE), will exhibit regional firsts in sustainable transport and clean energy at the event.

We are proud to support UAE Vision 2021, building a more sustainable future for Sharjah and the UAE, and hope to embark on new projects that will align with this ambition and set an example for many others to follow suit. By doing so, we hope that our young people across the world will inherit a greener, more sustainable economy that works to the benefit of everyone.

Khaled Al Huraimel is group chief executive of Bee’ah. The World Energy Congress will take place September 9-12 at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC). Visitors can find the Emirates Waste to Energy Company at Stand 110 in Hall 8, and ION at Stand 126 in Hall 9, at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC).",United Arab Emirates,2019.09
457,"Sanwo-Olu urges residents to minimise waste, earn money","Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State has advised the residents of the state to minimise waste by recycling them, thereby creating wealth in the process for themselves.

Sanwo-Olu gave the advice during the launch of the Lagos Blue Box Initiative held in Lagos on Thursday.

According to him, recycling is a major fortune earner for government and youths.

“In Lagos, 50 per cent of waste generated contained reusable resources, which can be channel into the economy of the state.

“The recycling of waste encourages the use of another person’s scrap as a fixed stock for another person’s process.

“It minimises waste in our society and generates income for the citizens.

“The Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) is saddled with this responsibility of driving a circular economy through active community engagement.

”This will encourage the effective use of recyclable materials to create value chain and create new markets for government and the people.

“Currently, the bulk of the recyclables are being harvested from the dump sites by scavengers in the informal sector.

“The resources harvested often time could not pass the quality test that are needed, making it difficult for the recyclers to get value for the materials,” Sanwo-Olu said.

He said that there was the need to address this challenge as well as tap into the new business opportunity available in the sub sector, which had necessitated the launching of the Blue Box programme.

Also speaking, the wife of the governor, Dr Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, said that the Lagos Blue Box programme would make the environment cleaner, healthier and livable for all residents.

She said that the programme also would create more jobs for women through job creation, adding that zero waste was a collective responsibility of all.

In his remarks, the Commissioner for the Environment, Mr Tunji Bello, said that the dearth of sufficient land space had also affected adversely the state waste management strategy.

”We are unable to get adequate landfill activities to accommodate the huge waste being generated on a daily basis, estimated to have grown from 10,000 metric tones to 14,000 metric tones within a period of five years.

“This has necessitated our urge to rethink our strategy in waste management and one of which is waste sorting. Our ultimate aim is to attain waste conversation and waste buyback.

“And in the process, turning our waste into resources,” Bello said.

“And in the process, turning our waste into resources,” Bello said.The Managing Director, LAWMA, Dr Olumuyiwa Gbadegesin, gave a technical brief on how the initiative would work in the state.

He said that Lagosians were used to the old-fashioned style of dumping all waste in just one container, for eventual evacuation to the transfer loading station or landfill site by the PSP operators.

Gbadegesin said that the Blue Box Programme would encourage separation of recyclable materials from the general waste at the point of generation.

“We are advising that we should have two waste containers in our homes , a black container for waste, and a blue container for recyclables.

“To kickoff the Blue Box programme, we are distributing these colour-codes recycling bags to each household through franchised recyclers for separation of recyclables.

“The bags will be collected on designated dates or on the assigned days of the week.

“LAWMA will promote the sorting culture with a reward system and participatory households will accumulate coupons distributed by the franchisee.

“The coupons will be exchanged with several redeemable options which include, but not limited to, reduction in amount paid for waste bills,” Gbadegesin said.

He noted that recycles, who exhibited the capacity to collect at the Local Government and Local Council Development areas would be expected to have a minimum of between five trucks and 10 trucks for collection of recyclables from door steps.

The Founder of the Kids Beach Garden Lekki, Mrs Doyinsola Ogunye, who represented the Recycles Association of Nigeria (RAN) commended the Lagos State Government for being the first state to key into recycling of waste in the country.

She called on other states of the federation to join in the campaign.",Poland,2019.09
461,Romania's Green Group gets 66 mln euro syndicated loan,"BUCHAREST (Romania), September 6 (SeeNews) - Romanian recycling company Green Group said it has received a 66 million euro ($72.8 million) syndicated loan from four banks in order to refinance existing loans and finance new investments and development projects.

The loan was granted by ING Bank, UniCredit Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo Bank and OTP Bank, Green Group said in a press release on Thursday.

The new financing line supports efforts to stimulate a sustainable economic model, in line with EU regulations, which facilitates transition to circular economy and has a major impact on combating climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, the group is reducing the CO2 footprint of synthetic fibers produced from 100% recycled PET by 75% compared to their production from oil.

Green Group integrates the operations of six companies active in recycling: GreenTech, GreenFiber International, GreenWEEE International, GreenLamp Reciclare, GreenGlass Recycling and Total Waste Management.

Since 2016, the group has been owned by Abris Capital Partners, a private equity fund dedicated to investments in Central and Eastern Europe.

The group has since then invested 170 million euro in Romania and has a total recycling capacity of 460,000 tons of waste per year.",Bulgaria,2019.09

Jakarta (ANTARA) - The country's Special Economic Zones are ideal locations for the development of the circular economy, Country Representative for Global Green Growth Institute in Indonesia Marcel Silvius believes.""A Special Economic Zone is a good place for the circular economy since clusters of companies can use the others' waste, so they can share resources,"" he said in Jakarta, Thursday. The Special Economic Zones refer to designated areas endowed with geo-economic advantages where special facilities and incentives are extended to attract investments.A sustainable Special Economic Zone does not merely focus on zero waste practices but also on renewable energy sources, he said.One of the Special Economic Zones he referred to was Mandalika in West Nusa Tenggara, which is a seeded tourist destination promoted by the Indonesian government as one of the 'Ten New Balis'.The Institute is currently working with the state-owned Indonesian Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) in identifying measures to develop eco-tourism in Mandalika, making the tourism destination sustainable which includes ensuring that energy provision uses renewable sources, Silvius said.At the moment, the institute is exploring options to make the city of Bitung in North Sulawesi, another Special Economic Zone, more sustainable. That means they are seeking possible investors and conducting feasibility studies in the area, he added.""We are also looking now into Sei Mangkei in North Sumatra for another sustainability development, especially a hazardous waste treatment plant, as Indonesia only has one such plant in Java,"" he explained.The Global Green Growth Institute is an international organization that promotes the development of green growth by working with country members.Green growth refers to an economic development approach that simultaneously considers the full range of economic, natural and social values to ensure that growth is good for the economy, planet and people.",Indonesia,2019.09
