10,EU volunteers take part in Karachi’s Sandspit beach cleaning,"KARACHI: The volunteers of European Union in Pakistan and World Wide Fund for Nature – Pakistan (WWF-Pakistan) led a two-day cleaning activity at Sandspit beach.

“Only 10 rivers around the world are responsible for 85% of the plastic pollution of the oceans. Of these, eight rivers are located in Asia, including River Indus,” said EU Ambassador HE Jean-François Cautain.

Speaking at the occasion, Ambassador Cautain said that the EU is committed to increasing awareness about plastic waste and its impact on marine life and the environment. The single-use plastic initiative is part of the EU’s broader Circular Economy agenda, including the world’s first Plastics Strategy, an EU-wide drive towards a more sustainable, circular economy.

As part of the Plastics Strategy, the EU has committed itself to look into further action to address marine litter that builds on the efforts underway in EU member states. He said, “The problem of marine litter is global by nature as it moves in the marine environment and adversely affects marine life.”

More than 70 volunteers from WWF-Pakistan and EU participated in the event. A total of 300 mangrove saplings were also planted while 100 bags of garbage were collected by the participants.

WWF-Pakistan Regional Head for Sindh and Balochistan Dr Babar Khan informed that Pakistan is among the top ten countries affected by climate change and one of the simplest actions citizens can take is to help increase the forest cover of the country, one tree at a time.

“Turtles maintain the health of the sea and removing them from the waters negatively impacts the marine ecosystem,” Dr Khan said. According to an estimate, there are more than 3,000 turtle nests on Sandspit.",Tuvalu,2018.09

468,Urban waste flows and their potential for a circular economy model at city-region level,"To enable cities to become more circular, i.e. close material cycles, decision-makers need detailed data about the production and treatment of waste. At city level, conventional statistics on waste are often incomplete or lack detail. Waste input-output accounting offers an alternative, using waste supply and use tables to create detailed inventories of economy-wide flows of waste. In this study we develop such tables for the city-region of Brussels (Belgium) and use them to analyse the urban waste metabolism in terms of waste flows, waste production intensity and waste treatment performance.

The waste flow analysis revealed: the amount of collected waste; the proportion contributed by individual sectors; the material composition of waste flows and the location of treatment. Currently, around 50% of the 1.5 million tons of waste collected in Brussels is treated in local facilities. However, less than 1% of the collected waste is used in a way that closes material cycles within city limits. The waste performance analysis reveals that the construction sector had the highest waste production intensity and the household sector the highest incineration intensity. In terms of waste prevention and local valorisation potential, we identified flows and sectors for future targeting, one of the most promising being food waste. We conclude that the urban context can restrict the local valorisation of waste flows, thus we see the role of cities such as Brussels in a circular economy as mainly contributing to the closing of material cycles at national or even global level.",N/A,2018.11
486,EFT Consult launches Circular Economy Club in Swansea,"Around 25 professionals gathered for Wales’ first global online festival last week dedicated to bringing together the circular economy community from across South West Wales. The event helped organisations understand the theory and application behind the concept of the circular economy.

EFT Consult, a specialist in building services design consultancy and the implementation of the principles of the circular economy, officially launched the Circular Economy Club in Swansea on 14th November 2018 with the support of 4theRegion – a new regional engagement project for South West Wales.

Held at the new Construction Wales Innovation Centre at the University of Wales Trinity Saint David Waterfront Campus in SA1, the event brought together professionals and businesses interested in sustainability, the bio-based economy, the built environment, valorisation of waste, and the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015.

The Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 is the first act of its type in the world that puts the well-being of people, resources and the planet at the heart of policy, key-decision-making and shared resource-values.

As part of the event, attendees were shown a number of inspiring short films curated by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, and discussed the progress the region is making towards implementing a circular economy strategy for future generations to benefit from now and in the future.

The Circular Economy is an alternative to the current linear model of take, make, waste. It is designed to help organisations be more prudent with their use of resources – to reuse, recycle, regenerate, and care for the well-being of people, resources and the planet.

The Circular Economy Club (CEC) is a non-profit international network of over 2,600 circular economy professionals and organisations in over 60 countries. The CEC is headquartered in London, coordinated by volunteers.

EFT Consult, is the official organiser of the Circular Economy Club in the City & County of Swansea, reflecting the company’s determination to help the regional economy become more circular and sustainable for generations to come.

Through its work with companies and organisations in the built environment across Wales and beyond, EFT deploys circular economy principles to help building owners and managers manage, maintain and renovate their facilities in line with the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015.

Dave Kieft, managing director of EFT Consult, said “Circular Economy practices are not only beneficial to people and the environment, but offer cost-savings and efficiencies for all businesses and organisations in our region, as well as aligning them with the law in terms of the Well-being of Future Generations Act. It is an economic, social and environmental ‘no-brainer’ that we move our economy towards a circular model, which is why we have formed the Swansea Circular Economy Club and intend to play our part in encouraging everyone to take the principles on board.”

Adrian Matthews, Circular Economy consultant at EFT, added “The beauty of the Circular Economy model is that it serves the well-being of everyone in a sustainable way. Businesses can grow and be environmentally responsible, in a way that also helps to regenerate businesses and the economy – through circular economy and well-being principles, through local sourcing, and through the use sustainable materials, products and services.”

Dawn Lyle, founder of 4theRegion, who facilitated the event, said “We see the move towards a circular economy as a fundamental part of how our regional economy develops over the next few years. There are great rewards at stake for businesses and regions prepared to lead the way in embracing circular economy principles. That’s the message, and that’s why we’re so keen to make sure everyone knows what the Circular Economy means and is engaged in the challenge.”",N/A,2018.11
516,How to define the quality of materials in a circular economy?,Improving the circularity of our economy calls for easily quantifiable metrics that allow us to track our progress towards circularity. We propose the use of a material quality indicator based on the energy use of recycled products versus their counterparts produced from primary material inputs only. We argue that such an indicator can cover at least the environmental dimension of the circular economy in a sufficient way and is therefore useful for the assessment of the circularity of our economy.,N/A,2018.11
518,What are the most significant aspects of supporting the circular economy in the plastic industry?,"Plastic is an indispensable material to our everyday life. However, some negative properties, for example, the durability under mild conditions, pose threat to the natural environment. The circular economy is an effort to mimic the loop-closing attribute of nature in anthropogenic systems. To bring plastics in such circularity in term of circular economy, a number of issues have to be handled from the quality of the recycled material to the acceptance of its use in new products. It is sometimes only a subtle step what we can do easily.",N/A,2018.11

558,Tailoring Hydrocarbon Polymers and All‐Hydrocarbon Composites for Circular Economy,"The world population will rapidly grow from 7 to 9 billion by 2050 and this will parallel a surging annual plastics consumption from today's 350 million tons to well beyond 1 billion tons. The switch from a linear economy with its throwaway culture to a circular economy with efficient reuse of waste plastics is therefore mandatory. Hydrocarbon polymers, accounting for more than half the world's plastics production, enable closed‐loop recycling and effective product‐stewardship systems. High‐molar‐mass hydrocarbons serve as highly versatile, cost‐, resource‐, eco‐ and energy‐efficient, durable lightweight materials produced by solvent‐free, environmentally benign catalytic olefin polymerization. Nanophase separation and alignment of unentangled hydrocarbon polymers afford 100% recyclable self‐reinforcing all‐hydrocarbon composites without requiring the addition of either alien fibers or hazardous nanoparticles. Recycling of durable hydrocarbons is far superior to biodegradation. The facile thermal degradation enables liquefaction and quantitative recovery of low molar mass hydrocarbon oil and gas. Teamed up with biomass‐to‐liquid and carbon dioxide‐to‐fuel conversions, powered by renewable energy, waste hydrocarbons serve as renewable hydrocarbon feedstocks for the synthesis of high molar mass hydrocarbon materials. Herein, an overview is given on how innovations in catalyst and process technology enable tailoring of advanced recyclable hydrocarbon materials meeting the needs of sustainable development and a circular economy.

Today, plastics are indispensable in economy and daily life. Unparalleled by other materials they are exceptionally versatile with respect to tailoring property profiles from steel‐like to rubbery, permeable/impermeable, durable/biodegradable, facile processing with short cycle times, energy‐and resource‐efficient production, recycling, and wide range of applications. They exploit virtually any kind of carbon source like oil, gas, biomass, waste plastics, and even the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide as raw material to produce advanced materials and materials systems which help to satisfy the elemental human needs for shelter, clothing, health, protection, mobility, communication, and safe supply of food, medicine, water, and energy.1 As highly cost‐, energy‐, and resource‐efficient multifunctional materials they render high tech affordable for everybody living in industrialized as well as developing countries. In manifold ways plastics innovations offer solutions to problems facing the rapidly growing world population which is expected to increase from 7 billion to more than 9 billion by 2050. Plastics are highly beneficial to society. Plastics packaging is essential for food safety, storage, distribution, and reduces food waste.2 In climate protection polymeric thermal insulators and lightweight engineering plastics contribute to significant energy savings accompanied by reduced emission of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide.3, 4 In health care functional polymers enable controlled drug release, protect humans against bacterial attack, and are components of implants, dental fillings, artificial hips, disposable syringes, blood bags, cosmetics, and numerous medical devices‐like sensors.5-8 Durability and safety rely on corrosion protection by coatings which safeguard metals even in a maritime environment.9-11 Polymer membranes are being employed in blood purification by artificial kidneys, water desalination and purification, recovery of metal wastes, separation of chemicals, and even in energy harvesting by means of fuel cells.8, 12-14 Without polymers as electrical insulators transportation of electrical energy would not be feasible.15, 16 Moreover, human comfort and leisure strongly benefits polymer innovations like functional textiles, lightweight engineering plastics, and formulated systems.17, 18 In view of the countless benefits of plastics innovations to society it is not surprising that the growth of plastics consumption, unlike steel and wood, closely follows the rapid growth of the world population.19 Since people living in developing countries aspire high living standards of industrialized countries the demand for plastics will continue to rise at a rapid pace from around 15 million tons in 1965 and today's 350 million tons to well above 1 billion tons in 50 years. At present around 4 wt% of oil and gas, most of which are derived from non‐renewable resources, are consumed as raw materials in plastics industry while further 4 wt% generate energy for plastics manufacturing and distribution.20 This percentage will drastically increase to more than 20 wt% with the surging plastics production which prompts new challenges for exploiting renewable feedstocks including waste plastics. Most polymers are durable, survive hundreds of years in the environment and slowly degrade to form micro plastics. Every year million tons of plastic litter end up in the oceans.21-27 Marine littering is an alarming signal and demands to move away from linear economy to circular economy and high energy‐ and resource‐efficiency in plastics production without sacrificing plastics' performance and cost‐efficiency. According to the Ellen Mc Arthur Foundation plastics packaging accounts for more than 26% of the total volume of plastics used but less than 14% of the waste packaging is collected for recycling.28 In fact, the global recycling rate of plastics is even much lower with respect to packaging and contrary to the higher global recycling rates for paper (58%) and iron and steel (70–90%). Each year, at least 8 million tons of plastics leak into the ocean which is equivalent to dumping the contents of one garbage truck into the ocean every minute. It is estimated that over 150 million tons of plastics are floating in the ocean today. The ocean is expected to contain 1 ton of plastic for every 3 ton of fish by 2025, and by 2050, more plastics than fish (by weight). To ensure that there exists enough natural resources like oil, gas, clean air, potable water, fertile soil, minerals, rare metals, wood, and biodiversity, the switch from a linear to a circular economy is mandatory. For a long period of time in linear economy, driven by burning fossil fuels, raw materials are converted into products which after completing their life cycle are thrown away. This continued reckless depletion of natural resources accompanied by massive emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and marine littering drastically impairs the life of future generations and could trigger a sudden collapse of the biosphere. In 1972 the Club of Rome already pointed out the limits of growth. The period of cheap and plentiful resources is over and the throw‐away culture must end.29-33 As illustrated in Figure 1 there exists two different pathways toward circular economy. In an euphoric bio‐economy vision, biomass utilization, genetic engineering, and biotechnology are seen as the Holy Grail in a bright future.32 In 2012 within the context of sustainable development the UN Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro (“Rio + 20”) endorsed the concept of building a prosperous and strong “greenish” world bio‐economy. In the politicians' and environmentalists' bio‐economy dreams solar power drives bio‐economy converting the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and water into biomass, which then serves as a feedstock for biofuels, biopower, and bioplastics. Upon thermal or bio‐degradation water and carbon dioxide are recycled. Although this combined use of renewable energy and renewable resources paralleled by switching from fossil to renewable resources is highly appealing to everybody severe problems are encountered. Dreams and reality of green polymer chemistry and bio‐plastics do not match.34 On one hand, only agricultural and forestry wastes should be used as renewable resources for bio‐based plastics to avoid conflicts and competition with food production which is in urgent demand with respect to feeding the rapidly growing world population. Furthermore, stepping up farming to serve the needs of bio‐economy could release massive amounts of carbon dioxide stored in the soil of swamps and forests. This could drastically accelerate global warming. On the other hand, biopolymers and biodegradable plastics are not true alternatives for synthetic polymers. The most abundant biopolymers such as cellulose and chitin are not melt‐processable and their use in polymer applications frequently requires chemical modifications many of which fail to meet the green chemistry requirements. Contrary to natural polymers, bio‐based synthetic polymers are derived from monomers produced by fermentation in bio‐refineries. However, they are produced by traditional polymer syntheses to meet the specific needs of polymer processing and applications. In fact, the extraordinary precision of biosynthesis like in protein engineering is rather problematic regarding tailoring melt‐processable plastics. Even transgenic plants and genetically modified bacteria fail to tailor broad molar mass distributions which enable shear thinning and melt strengthening in extrusion and blow molding. Moreover, the prospects of biodegradation and bio‐plastics in circular economy are limited for several reasons. First, biodegradation is highly sensitive to the climate. In landfill biopolymers similar to synthetic polymers do not degrade in the absence of water and oxygen. Even in a marine environment and in the biosphere biopolymers can have long life time. In landfill bio wastes pose a risk of emitting the greenhouse gas methane under anaerobic conditions. Second, biodegradation does not instantaneously and quantitatively convert bio‐wastes into carbon dioxide and water. For example, bio‐erosion of biopolymers and bio‐based polymers like polylactic acid can account for the formation of fine dust‐like particles which can cause emission and inhalation problems in cities. Furthermore, biodegradable particles serve as breeding ground for bacteria and other microorganisms. Third, biodegradation is counterproductive with respect to recycling since the illusion of biocompatibility and harmless biodegradation promotes reckless littering which is not restricted to bio‐based packaging. Therefore, substituting durable synthetic polymers for bio‐degradable and bio‐based polymers is no viable alternative to recycling. Circular economy goes well beyond the limited scope of bio‐economy and biopolymers. Key feature of circular economy is preventing waste by making products and materials more efficient and reusing them. Plastic wastes serve as raw material for both polymer processing in mechanical recycling and substitution of non‐renewable oil and gas in feedstock recycling. As a rule, all materials must be obtained sustainably without inflicting damage to the environment and human health. Rethinking the complex value chain of a low‐carbon, resource‐ and energy‐efficient plastics economy requires a combined effort of plastics manufacturers, retailers, recyclers, consumers, and politicians. In 2015, the European Commission adopted the EU Action Plan for a sustainable circular plastics economy demanding that the design and production of sustainable plastics and plastic products should address reuse, repair, and recycling.35, 36 In 2017, the Commission confirmed the focus on plastics production with the target of achieving 100% recycling of plastic packaging by 2030.37 An important challenge in sustainable circular economy is to develop environmentally friendly and sustainable plastics with improved performance and facile recycling without drastically impairing favorable economy. Particularly, recyclable all‐polymer composites in which matrix and reinforcing phases are made of the same polymer represent attractive sustainable alternatives to conventional composites containing polymers together with inorganic fibers and fillers. This overview highlights how breakthroughs in catalytic olefin polymerization and polyolefin processing create new generations of 100% recyclable hydrocarbon polymers and all‐hydrocarbon composites which satisfy the needs of the growing world population and meet the demands of circular economy.

In manifold ways hydrocarbon polymers like polyethylene and polypropylene, which account for more than half of the world plastics production and more than 90% of packaging materials, hold great promise regarding circular economy and sustainable development.38 They are produced in environmentally friendly and highly energy‐, resource,‐ and cost‐efficient catalytic processes without solvents and without by‐product formation using virtually any kind of carbon source as raw material ranging from oil, gas, and coal to biomass, waste plastics, and even the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Moreover, the exothermic olefin polymerization generates energy due to the high heat of polymerization of 3.34 MJ kg−1. As a solid modification of oil, which is a liquid low molar mass hydrocarbon, high molar mass hydrocarbon polymers possess high fuel‐like high energy content of 40 MJ kg−1. By varying catalyst compositions and process parameters hydrocarbon polymers are readily tailored to meet the demands of highly diversified applications like automotive bumpers, fatigue‐resistant pipes, food packaging, functional textiles, elastomers, furniture, and household appliances. Figure 2 illustrates the principle of hydrocarbon‐based circular economy for polyethylene. Oil, gas, biomass, waste plastics, and carbon dioxide are converted into ethylene gas which is polymerized in gas phase on highly active catalysts to produce melt‐processable polyethylene. At the end of the product life, the resulting waste hydrocarbons serve as raw materials for melt processing, feedstock recovery, and energy recycling. Upon heating above 300 °C in the absence of oxygen carbon–carbon bonds are cleaved and thermal degradation converts the solid hydrocarbons into liquid oil‐like and gaseous low molar mass hydrocarbons in essentially quantitative yields. Polymer pyrolysis consumes energy which is around 5 MJ kg−1. As is apparent from polymer pyrolysis investigations by Kaminsky (see Table 1), the thermal conversion of waste polyolefins like polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) into oil and gas is much more efficient with respect to biopolymers such as cellulose and lignin which produce considerably less oil and gas together with much higher amounts of residues and water.39-41 Most other commodity and engineering thermoplastics also represent valuable sources of renewable oil and gas gained by catalytic and non‐catalytic thermolysis. Variations of catalysts and process parameters increase the yield of liquid hydrocarbons and even allow for the recovery of 1‐olefins.41, 42 In the presence of small amounts of oxygen the partial oxidation in conjunction with gasification affords a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen which serves as syngas producing a variety of raw materials including oil‐like hydrocarbons obtained by the much more energy‐intensive Fischer–Tropsch process established in coal‐to‐liquid as well as biomass‐to‐liquid processes.43 Recovery of oil and gas by non‐catalytic polymer thermolysis Al‐Salem et al. gave an overview on the extraordinary versatility of polyolefins with respect to efficient material, feedstock, and energy recycling.44 While clean production wastes qualify for material recycling by remolding, polluted wastes of lower hydrocarbon quality are efficiently recycled by thermo‐chemical treatments to produce either fuels or petrochemical feedstocks. In municipal waste incineration polyolefin wastes serve as energy source due to their high energy content. According to Panda et al. the thermolytic conversion of polymer waste plastics to liquid fuel represents a viable process for plastics waste management.45 As compared to non‐catalytic thermolysis of waste polyolefin the addition of catalyst such as zeolites and mesoporous silica affords a better control of the ratio of liquid‐to‐gas‐to‐solid residue ratio as well as of the hydrocarbon branching and content of aromatics at milder temperatures below 450 °C.46-54 Serrano et al. developed hierarchical zeolites with bimodal micropore/mesopore size distribution which are highly active catalysts for polymer cracking.55 They favor a two‐step process which combines thermolysis with subsequent catalytic conversion to avoid catalyst poisoning by impurities. Also blends of hydrocarbon polymers and biomass are successfully employed in feedstock recovery by means of thermolysis.56 In principle, catalytic and non‐catalytic waste polyolefin thermolysis could team up with biomass‐to‐liquid conversion (“bio‐oil” and “bio‐diesel”)57-61 by catalytic thermolysis. In fact, the catalytic thermal liquefaction of waste plastics and waste biomass are highly attractive for recycling since oil has much higher density with respect to fluffy solid wastes and facilitates the transport of raw materials derived from wastes to refineries. In refineries hydrocarbons are attractive with respect to the production of fuels and chemicals. By steam cracking hydrocarbons are converted into ethylene and propylene monomers. The facile on‐board catalytic conversion could help to reduce marine littering by cruise ships which could convert hydrocarbon packaging wastes into diesel fuel. During recent years significant progress has been made with respect to capture of carbon dioxide which is converted into hydrocarbon fuels and olefin monomers. In Brazil sugarcane serves as feedstock for producing bioethanol which is converted into ethylene by catalytic dehydration to produce bio‐based hydrocarbon polymers like Braskem's Green Polyethylene.62 Today, the dream reaction of directly converting the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide into fuels and chemical feedstocks without biomass by‐pass becomes an industrially viable reality. By mimicking natural photosynthesis, sunlight drives the catalytic conversion of carbon dioxide and water into hydrocarbons.63-66 Electroreduction converts carbon dioxide and water into hydrocarbons‐like methane but also enables the formation of hydrocarbon fuels and even ethylene in the presence of copper catalysts.67-69 Exploiting hydrogen produced by electrochemical water splitting carbon dioxide is reduced to methanol using renewable energy. Methanol is an attractive intermediate.70 Albeit hydrocarbons derived from carbon dioxide are not yet competitive with gasoline from fossil resources it holds prospects for solar fuel production and the chemical storage of renewable energy produced by wind mills and photovoltaics.71, 72 However, all these manifold chemical recycling opportunities and alternative waste management systems exploiting carbon dioxide capture and a closed loop scenario require careful evaluation by means of life cycle assessment to compare the economic and environmental impact of renewable chemical feedstocks with fossil resources and energy recycling.73-77 The remarkable and ongoing progress made in polyolefin technology has greatly simplified polyolefin production and sets new standards in environmentally friendly and sustainable industrial polymer syntheses.38 Table 2 outlines the impact of important breakthroughs in polyolefin research and development on circular economy and sustainable development. In the early 1950s Karl Ziegler and the Phillips Petroleum Company discovered transition metal catalysts enabling catalytic low‐pressure ethylene polymerization at ambient temperature whereas free‐radical ethylene polymerization, developed during the 1930s, is much less energy‐efficient due to high polymerization temperatures well above 150 °C and significantly higher ethylene pressure exceeding 1000 bar. Moreover, unparalleled by high‐pressure ethylene polymerization, molar mass, molar mass distribution, end groups, as well as short‐ and long‐chain branching are readily varied as a function of catalyst composition and polymerization process parameters. Today, the spectrum of polyethylenes produced by catalytic ethylene polymerization spans from linear high‐density polyethylene (HDPE) for pipes to linear low density short‐ and long‐chain‐branched polyethylene (LLDPE) for packaging, ethylene/propylene/diene copolymers (EPDM) for rubbers, and ethylene/cycloolefin copolymers for optics and pharmaceutical packaging. In the aftermath of the first oil crisis during the early 1970s, energy efficiency became a successful marketing tool, which was successfully employed by the Union Carbide Corporation to boost LLDPE production well above 1 million tons within just 10 years albeit ethylene copolymers were commercially available since the late 1950s. In 1954 Giulio Natta successfully employed Ziegler's catalyst to polymerize propylene and to produce semi‐crystalline isotactic polypropylene (PP) as cost‐efficient and highly versatile lightweight engineering thermoplastic which exhibits a heat distortion temperature above 100 °C and successfully competes with metals, wood, and other less cost‐efficient engineering plastics. In the pioneering days, owing to the rather low catalyst activities and poor stereoselectivity of the first catalyst generations and slurry polymerization in hydrocarbon diluents, 1 ton of PP was produced together with up to 200 kg of by‐products like amorphous atactic polypropylene and highly corrosive and color forming catalysts residues, both of which were removed by extraction with organic solvents and disposed to landfill. Breakthroughs in catalysis and process technology, namely the discovery of highly active and stereoselective magnesium chloride supported titanium catalysts, have rendered polyolefin production environmentally friendly and highly cost‐, resource‐, eco‐, and energy‐efficient.78-86 With exceptional catalyst activities well above 106 g polyolefin/g titanium, which is equivalent to less than 1 ppm titanium content in the polymer, the non‐toxic catalyst residues are left in the polymer without encountering corrosion, color, and health problems. Moreover, catalytic polymerization on supported catalysts enables polymerization in gas phase and liquid propylene, thus eliminating the use of organic solvents. In modern polypropylene production a few kilograms of hydrocarbon by‐products per ton of PP are recycled in the refinery, no solvent emissions are encountered, and no production wastes end up in landfill. Ethylene polymerization in reactor cascades affords tailored polyethylenes with bimodal molar mass distributions comprising HDPE together with a few percent of ultrahigh molar mass polyethylene (UHMWPE) which serves as tie molecule for HDPE crystallites and significantly improves processing by shear thinning and enhances impact strength, stress crack resistance, tensile strength, and fatigue life of HDPE pipes.87, 88 The PE100 resins withstand a minimum circumferential stress of 10 MPa for 50 years at 20 °C and are particularly useful in highly demanding applications like gas and water distribution.89 Today, bimodal polyethylenes meet pipe industry standards with lighter weight HDPE pipes or pipes with the same wall thickness but significantly wider safety margins. Progress in polyolefin technology and its impact on circular economy and sustainable development No removal of catalyst residues which are left in the polymer (“leave‐in catalysts”) No by‐products like waxes and atactic polypropylene/no polymer purification by solvent extraction Tailoring polyolefins in a single reactor instead of reactor cascades During the 1990s the better insight in polyolefin particle growth and catalyst fragmentation has led to the development of the reactor granule technology like LyondellBasell's Spheripol process for PP and the Spherilene process for PE, producing pellet‐sized polyolefin particles during olefin polymerization.86, 90, 91 Industrial PP cascade reactor systems like LyondellBasell's Catalloy92-94 and Borealis' Borstar process95, 96 combine particle‐forming liquid‐pool stereospecific propylene polymerization in a loop reactor with subsequent ethylene/propylene gas‐phase polymerization to incorporate EPM rubber into reactor granules for improving the toughness/stiffness/strength balance of the resulting PP/EPM reactor blends. Since both PP pelletizing melt extrusion and PP/EPM melt compounding are no longer required, reactor granule technology brings considerable additional energy savings. Moreover, reactor granule technology represents the key to the development of the multizone circulating reactors as another significant innovation in PP production.90, 91, 97 In 2004 LyondellBasell launched the Spherizone process,91, 94, 98-100 to produce spherical PP particles with a tailored molar‐mass distribution in a single‐loop reactor. Growing PP particles circulate between riser and downer zones, which have different polymerization conditions and produce PP with different molar masses inside the growing PP particles. The resulting multimodal PP with ultrahigh melt strength is applied in rigid packaging. Ongoing innovations in catalyst and process technology significantly improved PP versatility and sustainability. During the 1980s the discovery of single‐site catalysts like metallocenes,101-107 constrained‐geometry catalysts,108-110 and post metallocenes111-118 have revolutionized sustainable polyolefin production. The facile variation of the molecular architectures of single‐site catalysts affords unprecedented control of molecular mass, molar mass distribution, branching, comonomer incorporation, and even polyolefin morphologies from the centimeter down to nanometer range. In addition to conventional titanium, vanadium, chromium, nickel, and zirconium catalysts for the first time highly active iron catalysts became available.116, 117, 119-122 Whereas the catalytically active transition metal of conventional catalysts is always allocated at the polyolefin chain end and short chain branching of polyethylene is achieved by ethylene copolymerization with 1‐olefins, LLDPE and even hyperbranched liquid polyethylene are produced by ethylene homopolymerization in the absence of 1‐olefins as comonomers using modern catalysts. In chain‐walking ethylene polymerization on diimine nickel and palladium complexes (Brookhart catalysts) the catalytically active transition metal travels up and down the polymer main and side chain during ethylene polymerization and enables alkyl‐branching.117 The co‐immobilization of early and late transition‐metal catalysts on an methylaluminoxane (MAO)‐tethered silica support affords control of branching using ethylene as the exclusive feedstock.122-125 The absence of 1‐olefin comonomers contributes to energy savings and reduced costs related to the production, transportation, and feed of 1‐olefin in LLDPE manufacturing. Most industrial catalysts for olefin polymerization are severely poisoned by comonomers bearing polar groups which successfully compete with olefins for vacant coordination sites. Today advanced nickel‐ and palladium‐based catalyst generations enable the alternating copolymerization of ethylene with carbon monoxide to produce polyketones126, 127 and the random copolymerization of ethylene with polar vinyl polymers to form polar LLDPE.128, 129 Even ethylene polymerization in water is now feasible.130 This impressive list of breakthroughs in polyolefin technology reveals that ongoing innovations greatly enhance resource‐, energy‐, eco‐, and cost‐efficiency of polyolefin‐based hydrocarbon materials derived from both fossil and renewable resources. Solvent‐free catalytic polymerization and catalytic degradation in conjunction with exceptional versatility in terms of melt processing, tailoring property profiles, applications, and recycling is unparalleled by most other non‐hydrocarbon materials. In an ideal way, recyclable hydrocarbon materials produced by means of catalysis with high atom economy in the absence of solvents and without by‐product formation meet the demands of green chemistry and sustainable development. Therefore, it is not surprising that in life cycle assessment polypropylene was ranked as the number one and polyethylene as the number two far ahead of bio‐based materials including polylactic acid.131

Today, most polymers are reinforced with alien fibers and fillers to improve their toughness/stiffness/strength balance which is essential for the development of lightweight materials in construction, automotive, and aerospace industries. However, high content of inorganic components and additional process steps drastically impair high energy‐, resource‐,and cost‐efficiency of hydrocarbon polymers and their recycling as material, feedstock, and energy source.132-136 Moreover, higher densities of the reinforcing agents account for higher weight with respect to the neat hydrocarbon polymers. In view of circular economy, sustainability, and further reducing weight it is highly desirable to self‐reinforce polymers without requiring the addition of alien materials. In self‐reinforced polymers alias molecular composites alias all‐polymers or one‐component composites, respectively, the polymer matrix is reinforced with fibers or sheets produced by aligning the chains of the same polymer. Preferably, 1D and 2D nanostructures of aligned polymers are formed by shear‐induced polymer crystallization during melt processing and do not require prefabricated nanoparticles as the nanostructures represent an integral part of the entire hydrocarbon polymer structural hierarchy. Moreover, the co‐crystallization of matrix and reinforcing (nano) phase affords excellent interfacial adhesion and efficient stress transfer from the matrix to the fiber‐ and sheet‐like nanostructures. The technical term “molecular composites” describes homogeneous dispersions of a rigid‐rod polymer in a rather flexible coil polymer matrix, albeit the same term has also been used to describe reinforcement of nanocomposites containing nanofillers.137 Today, the most prominent commercial representatives of molecular composites are rather expensive polymers like aramid or generally speaking liquid crystalline polymers (LCP). As pioneered by Keller and coworkers during the 1980s, in the case of all‐PE and all‐PP composites the formation of shish‐kebab structures of extended‐chain hydrocarbon polymers plays an important role.138-140 Another objective is to prepare all‐polymer nanocomposites by means of nanostructure formation which eliminates the use of problematic nanoparticles associated special safety and handling procedures and emission problems. As is illustrated in Figure 3, polymer self‐reinforcement is achieved either by multi‐step processes such as lamination of prefabricated stretched tapes, fabrics, and non‐wovens, or by single‐step processes like melt manipulation and nanophase separation, both of which produce fiber‐ and sheet‐like polymer nanostructures by shear‐induced polymer crystallization during melt processing. Whereas most strategies require special processing and exhibit rather narrow processing windows, nanophase separation of polyethylene rector blends enables self‐reinforcement during conventional polyethylene extrusion and injection molding without drastically affecting the processing window (see Section 4). Progress made in all‐polymer composite development was reviewed by Karger‐Kocsis et al.,141, 142 Alcock and Peijs,143 Fu et al.,144 and Yu et al.145 Routes to one‐component composites via multi‐step processes like hot compaction (welding) of stretched tapes and fibers and via single‐step processes like co‐extrusion, melt manipulation, and nanophase separation of reactor blends which do not require specialized melt processing. In multi‐step processes, which are being applied in commercial scale, polymer alignment is achieved in a separate process step producing prefabricated stretched tapes, fibers, fabrics, and films which are bonded together by means of hot compaction and welding. The basic principle behind all these techniques is to exploit the melt temperature difference between the oriented, highly stretched polymer as the reinforcement and the same non‐oriented polymer as matrix. Typically this difference is lower than 20 °C and implies rather narrow processing windows which require a careful temperature control in melt processing since heating above the melting temperature converts aligned polymers into entangled polymer coils. During the mid‐1970s the concept of producing one‐component hydrocarbon polymers was pioneered by Capiati and Porter who embedded drawn PE fibers into a PE matrix by adding them to PE melts without melting the PE fibers.141 Meanwhile several all‐PP‐composites‐like Curv, Armordon, Para‐Lite, and Pure are commercially available.146 Whereas Curv comprises laminates of PP fabrics embedded in a PP matrix, Pure, Para‐Lite, and Armordon are produced by hot compaction (welding) of stretched tapes. As is illustrated in Figure 4, according to Alcock and Peijs all‐PP composites are produced by laminating co‐extruded PP tapes containing a PP homopolymer core surrounded by a propylene copolymer skin which melts at somewhat lower temperatures with respect to PP core. Since the resulting recyclable hydrocarbon composites contained up to 90% oriented PP they exhibited significantly higher Young's modulus of up to 5.9 GPa as compared to 1.1 GPa for the corresponding non‐oriented PP.147-150 However, the precise temperature control during welding and thermoforming within a narrow processing window is essential as the difference between both melting temperatures is rather small and heating well above the melting temperature of the PP homopolymer melting temperature could cause the collapse of matrix reinforcement due to thermally induced PP stretch/coil transition.149, 151, 152 Most likely due to its brick‐to‐mortar structure resembling nacre, all‐PP composites combine high stiffness and strength with extraordinary damage tolerance as reflected by their outstanding impact resistance.151, 153 As reported by Ward et al. film stacking by hot compaction of fabrics and of co‐extruded tapes with and without interleaved films gave recyclable all‐PP composites with similar mechanical properties.154 High performance all‐PP composites, produced by the incorporation of PP fibers in a random PP copolymer, were also reported by Bárány, Izer, and Czigány.155 By applying the film stacking method the reinforced fibers were incorporated at different temperatures and processing times. They demonstrated that only by processing around 165 °C, very close to the melting temperature of the reinforcing PP phase (171 °C), significant increases of stiffness, strength, and impact resistance were achieved. Additionally, the time for the film stacking was crucial. Too short periods of compaction resulted in insufficient consolidation of matrix and reinforcing phase, while longer processing times exceeding 90 s deteriorated the fiber orientation. Further improvements especially in the flexural creep resistance have been addressed by Banik, Abraham, and Karger‐Kocsis who employed commercially available all‐PP (Pure). Pure itself consists of an ABA structure with an PP homopolymer as the core flanked by random PP‐copolymer skin layers.156 Commercial all‐PP composites processed by thermoforming exhibit remarkably low weight and are extremely strong, highly impact resistant, and 100% recyclable. They are the material of choice for producing light and highly damage‐tolerant suitcases and transport boxes as well as sports equipment like rackets, helmets, ski boots, and shin guards. Figure 5 shows a test car crash with a Samsonite Cosmolite suitcase made of woven PP. While the car is damaged beyond repair the severely dented all‐PP suitcase is highly damage‐tolerant and capable of self‐repair. Unlike the metal of the car body it fully recovers after impact to its original shape. Co‐extrusion of skin/core films or core/shell fibers, respectively, followed by hot compaction to produce all‐hydrocarbon composites. A test car crashes into an all‐PP suitcase which survives the crash unharmed whereas the metal is damaged beyond repair.

Karger‐Kocsis et al. prepared recyclable all‐PP composites by film stacking using PP fabrics as reinforcing phase and α and β polymorphs of isotactic PP homopolymer and random propylene/ethylene copolymers as matrix.157-159 Upon consolidation by hot pressing at 5 and 15 °C above the melting temperature of the PP matrix the use of β‐PP homopolymer afforded improved all‐PP composite performance with respect to propylene/ethylene copolymers. The PP fabric was composed of highly stretched PP homopolymer yarns exhibiting a melting point of 178 °C and a tensile strength of 465 MPa. Both static tensile and dynamic impact response were strongly affected by the consolidation temperature. Stiffness and strength usually increased while impact strength decreased with increasing consolidation temperature. Bocz et al. prepared flame retardant self‐reinforced composites from automotive shredder waste by adding plain woven fabrics (highly stretched split PP tapes) and ammonium polyphosphate (APP, Clariant AG).160 Flame retardancy and reinforcement are potential antagonistic requirements for PP, especially in the case of fiber reinforcement. The authors of the publication argued that multilayer composites of alternating layers of reinforcing PP‐tape and recycled PP‐waste with APP could circumvent this scenario. The automotive waste had a PP content of 78% and a density of 0.92 g cm−3. Benchmarks included compounds without reinforcing, glass fiber reinforced PP and the SRF‐PP. Sample preparation was done by film stacking and compression molding at 162 °C. The mechanical properties of the polyolefin waste were significantly improved by applying reinforcing polypropylene fabrics, resulting in five times higher tensile strength, two times higher flexural strength, and four times higher perforation energy. Although the tensile and flexural strength of the recycled matrix could be more effectively increased by using glass fabric reinforcement, the prepared self‐reinforced composites offered benefits with respect to environmental aspects, taking into account that their density was much lower with respect to glass fiber reinforced composites. Moreover, at the end of their life cycle, all‐PP is easy to recycle by simple reprocessing methods. Additionally, the flame retardancy measured by limiting oxygen index (LOI), UL‐94 testing, and cone calorimetry, showed significant improvement by the addition of 18 wt% APP.161 Alcock et al. analyzed in their studies the mechanical properties of unidirectional all‐PP composites.147 By co‐extrusion of a three‐layer tape (density of 0.732 g cm−3 due to micro voids) and by winding the tapes around a steel plate unidirectional oriented precursor structures were obtained. By carefully controlling the temperature in the hot compaction process, it was seen that the exterior of polymer fibers could be melted and with the simultaneous application of pressure, this molten polymer flows to fill the interfibrillar voids. Upon cooling, this recrystallized material formed the matrix phase of the composite. By this method “highly filled” composites (90% fibers) were obtained and exhibited similar properties to that of glass‐fiber filled composites (Young's modulus of 13 GPa, tensile strength of 370 MPa, and elongation at break of 8%) but much lower density of 0.77 g cm−3. This lower density combined with matrix reinforcement represents the special feature of all‐PP composites with high content of oriented PP and is characteristic for the hot compaction method. The low transverse composite strength was attributed to the tape geometry and especially to the high orientation. Since the width of the tape was about 36 times greater than the thickness of the tape, a large overlap in the transverse direction was present, thus providing extensive load transfer between tapes. Alcock et al. employed the hot compaction method to produce several families of recyclable all‐PP composites.149, 151, 153, 162, 163 In an alternative process, they obtained recyclable all‐PP composites by co‐extrusion and direct drawing of tapes without hot compaction.162 Opposite to two‐step processes which require prefabrication of oriented hydrocarbon polymers single processes exploit flow‐induced 1D and 2D crystallization of semi‐crystalline hydrocarbon polymers during melt processing combined with melt manipulation to achieve high elongational flow. As is illustrated in Figure 6, Ehrenstein and coworkers employed a convergent die with high elongational flow to generate HDPE shish which nucleated HDPE crystallization to form shish‐kebab‐like polyethylene structures as reinforcing phases.141, 164-167 However, only when the processing temperature was very close to the HDPE melting temperature relaxation and coil recovery were prevented at high extrusion pressure. According to Keller et al. the high molar mass tail of the HDPE molar mass distribution accounted for the formation of extended‐chain HDPE fibrils which formed the backbones of the shish‐kebab structures as reinforcing phases, whereas the lower molar mass HDPE affected melt strength and extrudability.140 As reviewed by Hsiao et al. variations of processing conditions affected HDPE morphologies and properties but according to in situ rheo‐X‐ray studies and microscopy self‐reinforcement was attributed to shish‐kebab structure formation.168 Shish‐kebab structures with multiple shish were observed at elevated UHMWPE content. Ryan et al. investigated the parameters governing shish‐kebab structure formation of bimodal polyethylene model systems obtained by solution blending of hydrogenated poly(1,4‐butadiene) as polyethylene model compounds.169-172 To enable the formation of oriented HDPE nuclei the shear rate should be higher than the inverse Rouse time of the longest chain and the mechanical work should exceed a critical threshold. At that time the state‐of‐the‐art catalyst technology did not permit to vary the HDPE molar mass distribution over a wide range as the incorporation of more than 3 wt% UHMWPE drastically increased melt viscosity and disabled melt extrusion due to massive entanglement. By using a convergent extrusion die and an extrusion pressure varied between 20 and 60 MPa, Huang et al. produced self‐reinforced HDPE173 and PP.174 From mechanical and tribological investigation they identified mechanical anisotropy of self‐reinforced HDPE.175 In addition to convergent dies a great variety of highly specialized injection molding processes (see Figure 7) like dynamic packing injection molding (DPIM),176-180 oscillating packing injection molding (OPIM),181, 182 shear‐controlled orientation in injection molding (SCORIM),183-191 and vibration injection molding (VIM)189, 192-196 have been developed to produce self‐reinforced hydrocarbon polymers.

Guan et al. investigated the mechanical properties and morphology of conventional HDPE using OPIM by varying oscillating pressure compared to static packing. Due to the existence of oriented shish‐kebab structures in flow‐direction Young's modulus and tensile strength simultaneously increased from 1 GPa and 23 MPa to 5 GPa and 93 MPa, respectively.182 Chen and Shen processed a PP homopolymer by OPIM. As compared to conventional molded PP with tensile strength of 31 MPa, elongation at break of 70–435%, and Izod impact strength of 2 kJ m−2, the resulting all‐PP composites exhibited higher tensile strength (57 MPa) and impact resistance (12 kJ m−2) at reduced elongation at break.181 SCORIM afforded PP shish‐kebab fiber structures together with significant amounts of γ‐iPP.197 As compared to conventional molded iPP, all‐PP composites prepared by SCORIM exhibited a higher Young's modulus of 3.3 GPa (+ 75%). Li et al. investigated the formation of shish‐kebab fibers by processing HDPE via VIM.198 It was shown that increasing the vibration frequency afforded higher crystallinity and shish‐kebab formation in the core of injection‐molded samples resulting in better mechanical performance. A comprehensive review comprising specialized injection molding techniques is given by Karger‐Kocsis et al.141 Bárány et al. produced all‐PP composites by classical injection molding.199 All‐PP composite sheets obtained by film stacking and hot compaction of aligned PP with a random copolymer were cut and processed by injection molding producing all‐PP composites with up to 80% PP fiber content. Their mechanical analysis showed increased yield stress and perforation energy by increasing fiber content. All specialized one‐ and multi‐step melt processing methods for manufacturing of all‐hydrocarbon composite exhibit rather narrow processing windows and significantly increase costs with respect to melt processing of commodity hydrocarbon polymers like PP and HDPE. New generations of hydrocarbon polymers tailored with advanced catalyst systems enable to fabricate all‐hydrocarbon composite by conventional injection molding, extrusion, and blow molding without impairing high cost efficiency typical for commodity all‐hydrocarbon composites.

Recent progress made in olefin polymerization catalysis enables to tailor unentangled, aligned, and nanophase‐separated ultrastrong fiber‐ and sheet‐like nanostructured hydrocarbon polymers as well as the corresponding all‐hydrocarbon composites. Among hydrocarbon polymers UHMWPE is well known to exhibit an exceptional combination of ultrahigh toughness and abrasion resistance unparalleled by most other non‐modified engineering thermoplastics. However, their massive entanglement accounts for drastically higher melt viscosity which is not tolerated by injection molding. Hence, UHMWPE powders are processed by sintering. Gel‐spinning was developed to produce ultrastrong fibers of extended‐chain UHMWPE exhibiting superior strength with respect to steel.200 Chanzy et al. pioneered tailoring of unentangled ultrahigh molar mass polyethylene by means of catalytic ethylene polymerization (see Figure 8 left). They produced UHMWPE films and high modulus/high strength UHMWPE filaments and tapes drawn directly from virgin unentangled UHMWPE without requiring solvents and gel processing.201-203 Going beyond the industrially limited scope of vanadium catalysts supported on a glass plate used in this first proof of concept, Rastogi et al. have employed advanced single site catalyst systems to prepare UHMWPE and UHMWPE reactor blends in the unentangled state to achieve high modulus and strength by drawing.204-213 Aida et al. obtained UHMWPE nanofibers with a diameter of 30 to 50 nm by ethylene polymerization referred to as “extrusion polymerization” on mesoporous silica supported titanocene catalysts (see Figure 8 right).214 However, this catalyst systems does not meet the demands of catalyst fragmentation and morphology control characteristic for industrial catalyst systems.

Middle and right figure reproduced with permission.Copyright 1999, The American Association for the Advancement of Science. At the beginning of the twenty‐first century the development of industrial multi‐site catalysts obtained by blending together different catalytically active sites, one of which produces unentangled nanophase separated UHMWPE, has enabled to produce nanostructured polyethylene reactor blends which afford all‐hydrocarbon composites by conventional melt processing like injection molding, extrusion, and blow molding established for commodity hydrocarbon polymers.38, 215 While in the past multisite catalyst systems were rather problematic regarding to their difficult process control resulting from concentration‐ and process‐dependent complex interactions between different sites, advanced supported multisite catalyst are exceptionally robust and enable precise control of molar mass distribution and formation of nanostructured reactor blends containing unentangled nanophase‐separated UHMWPE. Particularly, as shown in Figure 9, ethylene polymerization on quinolylsilylcyclopentadienyl chromium (III) half sandwich sites producing UHMWPE with molar mass >106 g mol−1 combined with bisiminopyridine iron (II) sites producing HDPE and bisiminopyridyl chromium (III) sites producing HDPE wax with low molar mass of 103 g mol−1 allows for tailoring trimodal PE molar mass distributions in which the ratio of the three different catalytically active complexes governs the weight ratio of polyethylene fractions having different molar masses.216 Moreover, the average molar masses of the individual fractions are unaffected by the catalyst composition and enable efficient control of trimodal distributions in both lab and industrial scale. The combination of quinolylsilylcyclopentadienyl chromium (III) and iron sites affords bimodal HDPE.217, 218 Ultrabroad bimodal polyethylene molar mass distributions are feasible when UHMWPE is incorporated into HDPE wax in the absence of HDPE with intermediate molar mass. Trimodal UHMWPE/HDPE/HDPE wax reactor blends prepared by ethylene polymerization on supported three‐site catalysts. The molar ratios of the transition metal complexes govern the mass ratios of UHMWPE, HDPE, and HDPE wax. As is illustrated in Figure 10, the unentangled UHMWPE nanophase separates during ethylene polymerization on multisite‐catalysts to form nanoplatelet‐like and spongy structures. However, it should be noted that no hazardous UHMWPE nanoparticles are formed since UHMWPE nanostructures represent an integral part of the entire polyethylene structure. During melt processing by means of extrusion and injection molding, using machines and processing parameters typical for melt processing of commodity HDPE, the nanophase‐separated UHMWPE melts and the resulting UHMWPE melt is elongated by shear forces to form extended‐chain nanofiber‐like structures which nucleate the crystallization HDPE and HDPE wax to form shish‐kebab structures as reinforcing phases of the HDPE matrix. In a close collaboration of Mülhaupt's group at the Freiburg Materials Research Center with Ender's group at the University of Heidelberg and LyondellBasell it was demonstrated that injection molding of trimodal polyethylene using processing parameters identical to those of HDPE tolerated more than 10 wt% UHMWPE.219 With increasing UHMWPE content stiffness as expressed by Young's modulus, tensile strength and toughness simultaneously increased. Further improvement of the toughness/stiffness/strength balance was achieved by using reduced graphene oxide as support which was dispersed as carbon nanofiller within the nanostructured reactor blend.220 The incorporation of HDPE wax serves as processing aid which lowers melt viscosity and enables to increase the amount of UHMWPE, paralleled by improved mechanical performance, without sacrificing melt processability by injection molding.221, 222 Unlike HDPE wax addition restricted to less than 1 wt% in conventional HDPE, the UHMWPE/HDPE reactor blend tolerated significant amounts of HDPE wax without encountering massive odor, color, and emission problems due to the highly efficient co‐crystallization of HDPE wax which is incorporated into the kebab structures. The morphology development was imaged by means of SEM analysis of virgin reactor blend powders (see Figure 11 left) and injection molded reactor blends (see Figure 11 center) etched with hot xylene. While the powder comprises platelet‐like and spongy nanostructures the injection molded reactor blends exhibit shish‐kebab‐fiber‐like structures containing extended‐chain UHMWPE as shish. Upon annealing the injection‐molded reactor blends above the HDPE melting temperature but below the melting temperature of the extended‐chain UHMWPE, followed by rapid quenching to prevent HDPE crystallization, removal of amorphous HDPE by hot xylene extraction revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis that extended chain nanofiber‐like UHMWPE structures with average diameter below 100 nm were formed.223 Such UHMWPE nanofibers are unavailable by gel spinning. This formation of extended chain UHMWPE was also confirmed by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and small angle X‐ray scattering (SAXS).219 Copyright 2016, Elsevier.

Instead of tailoring all‐hydrocarbon composites by ethylene polymerization on three‐site catalysts, all‐hydrocarbon composites are also produced by melt compounding of HDPE with ultrabroad bimodal polyethylene comprising nanometer‐scaled unentangled aligned UHMWPE dispersed in HDPE wax as masterbatch (see Figure 12).222-225 Upon compounding the content of HDPE is readily varied as a function of HDPE addition in melt compounding whereas the UHMWPE/HDPE wax ratio is constant and set by the molar ratio of the catalytic sites in ethylene polymerization on two‐site catalysts during bimodal masterbatch formation. The processing window is much wider with respect to hot compaction and does not require special injection molding machines or tedious adjustment of processing parameters. However, the processing temperature should not exceed 250 °C since stretch‐coil transition destroys the reinforcing phases.225 Typically the mechanical properties increase with decreasing processing temperature. In principle, bimodal PE masterbatches also enable to transport and disperse nanometer‐scaled UHMWPE in other high and low molar mass media. Both all‐hydrocarbon composites tailored by ethylene polymerization on three‐site catalysts and all‐hydrocarbon‐composites prepared by melt compounding of HDPE with bimodal polyethylene masterbatches produce 100% recyclable hydrocarbon material with excellent properties approaching the range of glass‐fiber reinforced polyethylene. In addition to the simultaneous improvement of toughness/stiffness/strength also the wear resistance improves to reach the range of UHMWPE which is not processable by injection molding (see the spider diagrams displayed in Figure 13).224 It should be noted that all‐polyethylene composite formation is not restricted to multi‐site catalyst technology. Ethylene polymerization on an iron catalyst supported on nanocellulose also produces self‐reinforcing all‐polyethylene composites due to the presence of significant amounts of unentangled UHMWPE which form shish‐kebab structures during injection molding.226 All‐hydrocarbon composites by melt compounding of HDPE with a bimodal UHMWPE/HDPE wax reactor blend. The HDPE content is governed by the HDPE addition during melt compounding, whereas the constant ratio of UHMWPE/HDPE wax is set by the molar ratio of the catalytically active sites used in masterbatch formation by ethylene polymerization on a two‐site catalyst. Right: All‐PE composite (21 wt% HDPE wax, 63 wt% HDPE, 14 wt% UHMWPE, and 2 wt% graphene oxide which was used as catalyst support) obtained by ethylene polymerization on a supported three‐site catalyst (see Figure Property profiles of all‐polyethylene composites as compared to HDPE. Left: Mechanical properties of an all‐PE composite (9 wt% HDPE wax, 59 wt% HDPE, and 32 wt% UHMWPE) prepared melt blending HDPE with a bimodal masterbatch produced by ethylene polymerization on a two‐site catalyst (see Figure 12 ).Right: All‐PE composite (21 wt% HDPE wax, 63 wt% HDPE, 14 wt% UHMWPE, and 2 wt% graphene oxide which was used as catalyst support) obtained by ethylene polymerization on a supported three‐site catalyst (see Figure 9 ). A striking feature of all‐hydrocarbon composites is their outstanding recycling capability. As hydrocarbon material they serve as source of energy and feedstock recovered by thermal degradation. In addition, opposite to composites containing alien fibers, they are readily recycled as material by remolding. As seen in Figures 14 and 15 neither mechanical properties nor nanostructures changed after repeated remolding at 200 °C. Copyright 2018, Wiley‐VCH, John Wiley & Sons.

An important challenge in the twenty‐first century is to satisfy the needs of the rapidly growing world population which is expected to increase from 7 to 9 billion by 2050. In manifold ways plastics help to meet the basic human demands for shelter, clothing, health, mobility, communication and secure transport of food, water, medicine, and energy. All people living in industrialized and developing countries aspire the same high quality of life which is intimately connected with the surging demand for plastics. In fact, the annual growth of plastics production closely parallels the exponential growth of world population and is expected to rise from around 15 million in 1964 and today's 350 million tons to well above 1 billion tons in 2050. Whereas more than one‐third of the durable plastics are consumed in short‐lived packaging much less than 20 wt% of packaging materials are recycled. In fact, the global recycling rate for plastics is drastically lower with respect to that for paper (58%) and iron and steel (70–90%). Marine littering is just one of the alarming signals for accumulation of durable waste plastics in the biosphere when recycling fails. The switch from the throw‐away culture in linear economy to circular economy with recycling and a more efficient use of renewable resources and renewable energy is mandatory. Today, the European waste management relies on landfill, incineration, and mechanical recycling, whereas feedstock recycling plays an insignificant role. This may change since waste hydrocarbons are attractive raw materials and available in large quantities which make feedstock recycling much more attractive. In 2015 the European Commission had initiated the transition from linear to circular plastics economy and plans to achieve 100% recycling of waste packaging by 2030. Among plastics hydrocarbon materials like polyolefins account for more than half of the plastics production and a large portion of waste packaging. They offer attractive prospects regarding establishing both closed‐loop recycling and efficient product‐stewardship systems. Key feature is their efficient transition between liquid and solid state as a function of their molar mass. Additionally, both high and low molar mass hydrocarbons have similar fuel‐like high energy content. High molar mass hydrocarbons serve as highly versatile, cost‐, resource‐, eco,‐ and energy‐efficient, durable lightweight materials produced by highly efficient solvent‐free environmentally benign catalytic olefin polymerization. Olefin monomers are readily gained from virtually any carbon sources ranging from oil, gas, and coal to bioethanol, biomass, waste plastics, and even carbon dioxide. Upon completing their product life, waste hydrocarbon can be funneled into all pathways established for material, feedstock, and energy recycling. In view of the rapidly increasing amount of hydrocarbon wastes their reuse as renewable source of hydrocarbon oil and gas is gaining attractiveness especially as an alternative to energy recycling by incineration accompanied by carbon dioxide emissions. Thermolysis readily cleaves carbon–carbon bonds and quantitatively converts solid hydrocarbon materials into low molecular weight hydrocarbon oil and gas useful as chemical feedstock and source of energy. This quantitative conversion is unparalleled by biopolymers and synthetic polymers containing heteroatoms. The liquefaction of waste hydrocarbon materials facilitates the transport of wastes to refineries. In principle, delocalized thermolysis combined with centralized refining offers prospects for efficient waste management and feedstock recycling. Teamed up with biomass‐to‐liquid and carbon dioxide‐to‐fuel conversions, powered by renewable energy, liquefied waste hydrocarbons serve as renewable hydrocarbon feedstocks for producing chemicals, polymers, and fuels. The use of durable hydrocarbon materials in closed‐loop hydrocarbon economy is far superior to bio‐economy based on biodegradable plastics and biopolymers. Biodegradation depends on the climate and is counterproductive regarding the efficient reuse of polymers as it fosters dumping wastes in the environment. In the absence of water and oxygen also biodegradable plastics can survive for decades in the environment. In landfill they pose a risk of emitting the greenhouse gas methane by anaerobic biodegradation. Moreover, most bio‐based plastics and biopolymers do not instantaneously decompose to form carbon dioxide and water. The dream of closed‐loop bio‐recycling using the conversion of water and carbon dioxide into biomaterials which decompose quantitatively to recover water and carbon dioxide is far away from the reality. Biodegradation is frequently accompanied by bio‐erosion producing micro‐bioplastics which are carried away by wind and water. They serve as breeding grounds for bacteria and other microorganisms and can pollute the air in cities. Biodegradable polymers are attractive for niche markets but in contrast to hydrocarbon polymers do not offer environmentally friendly global solutions for packaging waste problems. Furthermore, it should be noted that solventless hydrocarbon gas phase processes offer advantages with respect to biosynthesis in water. Manufacturing of paper is not a green process and much less environmentally friendly with respect to polyethylene synthesis. Hydrocarbon polymers like polyethylene and polypropylene have low carbon footprint and are the clear leaders in the world production of plastics and also in life cycle assessment. This is due to the remarkable progress made in polyolefin manufacturing. During the late 1950s the production of 1 ton of polypropylene yielded up to 200 kg of by‐products like atactic polypropylene which was removed by solvent extraction together with corrosive catalyst residues, both of which were deposited in landfill. Today, exceptionally active and selective catalysts polymerize olefins in gas phase or liquid monomer with yields exceeding 1 ton polyolefin per 1 g transition metals without formation of wax‐like polymers as by‐products. Hence, purification and solvent recycling steps were eliminated. Moreover, reactor‐granule technology produces pellet‐shaped hydrocarbon particles during polymerization and does not require pelletizing melt‐extrusion. Unprecedented control of molar mass and branching distribution of polyethylene significantly improved the lifetime of gas and water pipes and reduced the weight of hydrocarbon packaging. The ongoing breakthroughs in catalyst and process technologies allow for facile tailoring of advanced hydrocarbon polymers for circular economy. In a recent advance nanophase separation and alignment of unentangled hydrocarbon polymers has afforded 100% recyclable and highly damage‐tolerant all‐hydrocarbon composites processed by injection molding typical for commodity polyolefins without requiring the addition of either alien fibers or hazardous nanoparticles. While composites containing alien fibers are problematic in recycling, self‐reinforced nanostructured all‐hydrocarbon composites produced by ethylene polymerization on multisite catalysts are readily recycled as material by repeated remolding, as feedstock by thermolysis of wastes or as source of energy. Today, commodity hydrocarbon polymers are being converted into high performance hydrocarbon materials without sacrificing their economic benefits, high energy and resource efficiency, low weight, durability, and extraordinary versatility in terms of tailoring property profiles, facile processing, wide range of applications, and recycling. In an ideal way fully recyclable and versatile all‐hydrocarbon materials with low carbon footprint make efficient use of resources and satisfy the needs of the growing world population for low cost advanced materials, green chemistry, sustainability, and circular economy.",N/A,2018.11

697,A perspective on a locally managed decentralized circular economy for waste plastic in developing countries,"Plastics are used in every country on earth and none is able to successfully collect and manage 100% of its plastic waste. Once produced, plastic enters the global supply chain and is used in all regions of the world. In fact, our world is generating, consuming, and discarding more plastic than ever, and the rates are increasing 1-5. The growth rate of plastic production has increased at 5% per year worldwide 1. In 2010, approximately 270 million metric tons (MT) of plastic were produced, with 99.5 million discarded as waste by coastal populations living within 50 km of the coast 6. Additionally, it was estimated that of the plastic waste generated that year, 31.9 million MT were mismanaged on land and 4.8–12.7 million MT entered the oceans 6. If current trends continue, by 2050, 33 billion MT of plastic are likely to be produced, with approximately 12.2 billion MT disposed of as waste, 3.9 billion MT mismanaged on land, and 0.6–1.6 billion MT eventually entering the oceans 2, 6. This is a 122‐fold increase in a matter of 40 yrs, meaning that global plastic production is increasing exponentially. Just between 2015 and 2026, we will make as much plastic as has been made since its production began 3.

There are numerous potential resting spots for waste plastic in the ecosystem including disposal in landfills, recycling, incineration, and unregulated dumping. Disposal on land is the most common option with previous studies showing that globally 60% of plastic municipal solid waste (MSW) is discarded in open space or in landfills 1. A key challenge is that in much of the world, appropriate waste disposal options are unavailable, including properly managed landfills, leading to waste plastic simply being dumped on open unestablished plots, accumulating on sides of roadways, and on outskirts of rural residential areas. This accumulation of plastic waste on land can become a breeding ground for mosquitoes, cause clogged waterways and drainages, and reduce the general aesthetics of the community 1. As plastic can take thousands of years to decompose, both landfills and unregulated plots of land will remain unusable long after the dumping ends 7, 8, and if not managed properly, chemicals can leach from the plastic into surrounding habitats 2. Eventually, this plastic waste will be disposed of in, or migrate to surface waters, generating pollution and threating both terrestrial and marine life. Specifically in major bodies of water, plastic waste is ingested by marine life and bird species, resulting in adverse health effects, entanglement, and death 2-4, 9-11.

Figure 1 shows plastic bags collecting in a drainage canal in Kampala, Uganda, due to unregulated dumping. This is a common problem in many resource‐constrained or infrastructure limited parts of the world, where lack of effective governmental policy, MSW management administration and planning, along with insufficient household education, economic pressures, limited perspectives on hazards associated with waste accumulation, and scarce stakeholder involvement affect how waste is disposed or managed 12, 13. Other factors include growing economies, urbanization, and increased standards of living, which led to rapid increases in waste generation in developing countries 14. In rural regions particularly, access to centralized collection and recycling methods are often unavailable. Consequently, uncontrolled growth coupled with lack of sufficient infrastructure and regulation in underdeveloped regions of developing countries compounds the waste management problem 15-18. Because these factors include economic and social as well as environmental components, it is critical that proposed solutions include them as well. Therefore, in our view, without considering the three pillars of sustainability, MSW management solutions are unlikely to achieve long‐term success.

Unfortunately, there are currently no globally effective strategies to keep waste plastic out of the ecosystem that meet the challenges of both developed and developing countries. This is primarily because waste plastic is not a point‐source pollutant. As plastic enters the ecosystems from numerous points, it has been a major obstacle for control 5. Moreover, low‐income and low‐to‐middle income countries lack the resources to address this problem. In fact, in addition to lack of waste collection and management infrastructure in underdeveloped regions, researchers have identified that simply the lack of convenient waste disposal containers can affect household waste disposal decisions 15, 19. If people have to walk long distances to reach a suitable disposal location, they will simply dump the waste nearby on streets, underdeveloped plots of land, or burn it, leading to potentially toxic smoke, especially if plastics are present. This underscores our assertion that locally managed decentralized solutions—targeting waste where it is generated rather than focusing on centralized processing—may be more effective in communities where governmental waste solution efforts are minimal. This type of approach empowers individuals and small communities to adapt and invent solutions rather than waiting on central authorities to enact policies and regulations to address the problem. As a result, a locally managed decentralized circular economy of plastic products is generated, encouraging direct users of plastic to consider and benefit from opportunities of providing waste plastic a value, or by generating new life cycles for plastic products through a cradle‐to‐cradle approach 20. We assert that a decentralized circular economy of plastic at the local level can have tremendous benefits in reducing the accumulation of plastic waste on land and its eventual migration to major bodies of water. An industrial circular economy replaces the produce‐consume‐discard model by reusing, recycling, or reentering products into their manufacturing supply chain on an industrial scale 20-28. However, at the local level, especially in rural regions, remanufacturing of plastic products, or creating the infrastructure networks to reenter them into their respective supply chains is difficult. Traditional solutions, like centralized recycling of plastic waste, are also often impractical in remote regions, or regions lacking well‐developed infrastructure due to the transportation costs, making large‐scale recycling operations uneconomical. Hence, a locally managed decentralized circular economy functions to manage waste on small scale in rural regions, without the need of industrial technologies or developed infrastructure. Viable solutions are those that are low cost, can be implemented utilizing the region's technical knowledge, and most importantly provide an incentive for local people to collect, reuse, and recycle themselves. In many economically disadvantaged regions, an informal local recycling sector exists via a system of waste pickers that sort through dumpsites to collect saleable materials such as metals, plastics, glass, and papers 21, 29-33. Often, waste pickers travel throughout communities of rural regions and cities to collect recyclables from house‐to‐house as well, or set up recycling drop‐off locations, paying individuals a small incentive for valuable materials. Afterward, the waste pickers will sort through collected materials, clean, and sell them to recycling companies for a profit. These companies then shred and process the materials as desired by manufacturing organizations. In this way, rural communities and heavily populated urban centers of developing countries benefit from a decentralized circular economy of recyclable materials, including plastics. However, not all plastics that are recyclable are of value to waste pickers due to a nonexistent recycling market. For instance, polyethylene shopping bags are generated in large volumes globally, but they are recycled in extremely low quantities 21, accumulating on sides of streets, dumps, and landfills in developing countries. Even in the United States, 380 billion plastic bags are consumed annually, with only 5.2% being recycled 7, 8. So, unless waste plastic items, such as polyethylene bags can be given a value, they will continue to be unsustainably used and discarded. Therefore, we assert that a locally managed decentralized circular economy with informal recycling playing a vital role in decreasing the accumulation of plastic waste is needed. Furthermore, we believe that including social and economic considerations in addition to environmental are critical to successful waste plastic abatement strategies in underdeveloped regions, which has been lacking in most plastic abatement strategies. In Figure 2, we propose a strategy for establishing a circular economy at the local level by applying the three principles of sustainability to decentralized waste plastic management. This strategy is thermal decomposition of waste plastic to fuel oil at temperatures of 400°C–450°C 34, 35. High‐density polyethylene, low‐density polyethylene, polystyrene, and polypropylene plastics 7, 8, 34-45 can be easily converted to fuel similar in composition to diesel and kerosene by individual entrepreneurs utilizing appropriate technology (AT), providing a potential path to a locally managed decentralized circular economy. AT is simple nonautomated technology requiring little to no electricity, designed for a specific region to meet specific challenges according to available resources 34. An AT solution for thermal decomposition of waste plastic is the UKATS Processor 34, 35. This invention is constructed locally utilizing existent construction materials, available infrastructure, technical knowledge of intended users, and from easily acquired locally generated plastic wastes. For instance, the UKATS Processor is wood fired to allow for the skills of rural communities that operate wood fired cookstoves to be readily applied. Moreover, the desired plastics can be easily collected by waste pickers or entrepreneurs by either identifying the plastic recycling numbers (2, 4, 5, and 6, respectively) or by performing a simple density test of the shredded plastics in water. That is, if the waste plastics float on water, they are suitable for reprocessing to fuel oil. A locally managed decentralized circular economy for waste plastic in infrastructure limited regions. [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com Consequently, a locally managed decentralized circular economy gives waste plastic an economic value, which incentivizes people to collect and use it locally, reducing waste accumulation. It further significantly reduces the need for physical and technical infrastructure to implement an industrial circular economy of plastic by involving local community participation as shown in Figure 2. In addition, this approach is socially and environmentally appropriate. For instance, as accumulation of waste decreases, sanitation issues decrease, improving community health. Likewise, environmental benefits are reaped by decreasing waste leachate into soil and reducing toxic hazards associated with incineration of plastic waste—a commonly practiced alternative to managing accumulation in rural regions and near slums 38, 40. The fuel oil itself also does not have sulfur dioxide emissions as sulfur is not present in the carbon‐hydrogen plastic polymer chains, reducing greenhouse gas sulfur dioxide emissions in comparison with traditional petroleum derived fuels 34.

We propose that in order to identify countries that will have the greatest potential for a locally managed decentralized circular economy, the three pillars of sustainability—environmental, economic, and social acceptability—should be incorporated. Hence, waste plastic abatement strategies cannot simply focus on the environment; they must also be economically viable and socially acceptable. We believe that unless solutions are targeted to be appropriate for the communities for which they are intended, they will ultimately be unsuccessful. To validate this perspective, we developed a simple metric that utilizes a big data approach to analyze countries' outlook in each of the three pillars of sustainability, highlighting regions where a locally managed decentralized circular economy for plastic is likely to have the highest positive impact. Today, data availability is better than it has ever been. Governments, private corporations, and NGOs are collecting ever increasing volumes of data, and much of that data is now publicly available and readily accessible via the Internet. This data is useful in conducting sustainability assessments for individual countries and regions. Here, it is organized and analyzed to identify countries which can potentially benefit from a plastic circular economy at the local level with decentralized waste plastic abatement strategies. The purpose of this metric is therefore to identify countries that have specific challenges with any or all three of the pillars of sustainability in meeting their waste management challenges, in return directly affecting the way plastic waste is handled. Often waste management is a priority in urbanized regions of developing countries, with little attention given to rural regions. Challenges such as variation in income level, conditions of road infrastructure, and perception of communities toward waste, including education regarding hazards associated with waste influence the way waste is handled in both urban and rural regions. As a result, wealthy communities experience regular waste collection, while slums outside of a city are perceived as dumping grounds for waste. Thus, our approach considers the challenges facing each country or region, in terms of economic, social, and environmental concerns to propose decentralized waste plastic solutions that are tailored to the region's availability of infrastructure, capital, and technical knowledge. Moreover, if community participation is prioritized, engineered AT solutions are more likely to be accepted, leading to intended uses and benefits, reducing the dependency on central waste collection and management for rural regions, specifically. In this metric, a list of 200 countries was analyzed using nine indicators, representing the three pillars of sustainability—economic, social, and environmental. These indicators are described in Table 1 and were chosen because they identify countries with widespread poverty, underdeveloped infrastructure, weak governmental institutions, and an existing MSW management problem—key indicators for determining the suitability of a locally managed decentralized circular economy. The development of the metric (see Eq. 1 ) considers assigning specific and global weighting factors to each of the nine indicators mentioned in Table 1 to highlight the importance of each indicator and the environmental, economic, or social outlook of the countries. As a result, a country's specific and global weighting factors can be individually adjusted to ensure that the country's outlook, challenges, and advantages are equally highlighted. Afterward, the sum of indicators and respective weighting factors results in a comparison score of each country's viability for a locally managed decentralized circular economy. Further details of this approach are described in the Supplementary Information. Indicators used to develop metric for identifying regions most suitable for a consumer‐focused decentralized circular economy. This indicator gives a general overview of the wealth of the country, which is directly associated with the availability of developed infrastructure. As GDP alone is not enough to characterize the economic wellbeing of a country's population, this indicator was included as well. This indicator shows the magnitude of the MSW generated in a country. This indicator shows the concentration of MSW by including the country's land area. This indicator is specific to the key focus of this perspective, which is waste plastic. This indicator provides an overview of the suitability of a locally managed decentralized solution targeted at mismanaged waste. This indicator shows how many people can be potentially impacted by proposed perspective and abatement solutions. This indicator shows the general wealth of the population and how likely they are to benefit from entrepreneurial opportunities associated with waste management. This indicator relates population to the rate of waste accumulation per land area, identifying hurdles of waste collection as crowded countries often have infrastructure challenges. where G is the global weighting factor, I is the indicator type, S indicates specific weighting factor corresponding to an individual indicator, EC denotes economic, SC denotes social, and EV denotes environmental. This metric can be utilized by researchers, policy makers, and other users to achieve an in‐depth understanding of a country's waste management outlook, particularly with respect to the economic and social indicators, which are often overlooked. Users can adjust local or global indicator weighting factors according to a region's unique challenges or to emphasize a specific category that contributes to plastic waste mismanagement. Hence, opportunities for managing waste can be identified, with a locally managed decentralized circular economy being a viable approach.

For the base case, all local and global weighting factors for each of the nine indicators were weighted equally. The results of the big data analysis metric for identifying key regions suitable for a locally managed decentralized circular economy are illustrated in Figure 3. Darker colors represent countries that are most likely to benefit from this approach. It can be observed that sub‐Saharan Africa, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia are the most promising regions for applying decentralized solutions to plastic waste management. This information indicates that typically, developing highly populated low‐middle to middle income countries are the most important targets for locally managed decentralized waste plastic abatement strategies. The reason being that even though the citizens of these countries generate less waste per capita , the consequence of higher population density results in an overall larger amount of MSW generation than developed regions. Coupled with limited financial resources, lack of infrastructure and reliable access to energy 20, waste is increasingly susceptible to unsound disposal in open dumps, streets, and waterways, especially in rural communities. Contrastingly, developing nations considered by the metric that may consume greater amounts of energy and generate higher amounts of MSW per capita are not ideal locations for a locally managed decentralized circular economy due to the reasons of improved collection, strong waste management infrastructure, controlled waste disposal, and an existent centralized, industrial circular economy, leading to reduction in unsound waste disposal. Suitable regions for a locally managed decentralized circular economy for plastic. [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com The usefulness of this metric can be additionally demonstrated by weighting one of the three sustainability categories greater than the rest as per the user's interests. To illustrate this, the weighting of global sustainability indicators was varied by assigning a value of 50% to one, while the other two were set to 25%. This analysis is presented in Table 2 and signifies that when weighting the global economic indicator higher, countries with relatively low GDP per capita and high percentages of population living below the poverty line rise to the top as most suitable regions. In like manner, for social sustainability, countries with the greatest population numbers or population density are recommended. Meanwhile, estimated plastic waste in MSW 2016 and estimated unsound disposal of plastic waste in MT/day were found to be the biggest contributing factors for environmental sustainability highlighting regions suffering from uncontrolled waste accumulation. Lastly, the metric also depicts the impact of environmental stress, or the amount of waste generated per km2 of land. Countries that rank highly in this category include the United States, many western European nations as well as high‐income Southeast Asian countries, such as Hong Kong, Macao, and Singapore, which have significant environmental stress due to either high generation of MSW, population density, and/or limited land area 46, 47. Comparison of 20 countries most suitable for decentralized waste plastic solutions according to different sustainability category weightings. As an example, India had the position of being 10th overall in this metric analysis, while being 52nd, 8th, and 5th most suitable country when global economic, social, and environmental indicators were respectively highlighted for implementation of a locally managed decentralized circular economy. Therefore, it can be concluded that for India, the lack of waste management education, attitude toward environmental protection, and insufficient collection infrastructure combined with increased waste generation due to population density are the most probable causes of plastic waste accumulation, instead of capital constraints. It is also important to note that even though a circular economy is well established in China, the country currently practices a centralized industrial circular economy 22-24. Hence, it could likewise benefit from a locally managed decentralized circular economy approach in rural regions due to high waste generation associated large populations. Although this analysis may appear to simply reinforce well‐established beliefs, these results are used to make the point that developing urban and rural regions around the world are different, in return requiring different strategies for MSW and waste plastic abatement. The information obtained from the analysis suggests that African nations vary in their economic, social, and environmental stance compared with developing regions of Asia. This fact in itself alters the way waste management is approached in these countries, as cultural norms associated with perception of waste management vary. Another example is the data highlighting importance of waste recycling in the Americas versus in Europe. Even though both regions are developed, environmentally benign waste management is practiced in many European nations via a variety of waste‐to‐energy solutions, while a large portion of waste in the United States goes to the landfill. Hence, the data are used to make the case for designing and developing technologies based on each region's outlook, suggesting a locally managed decentralized circular economy in rural regions of developing countries.

The country of Uganda is positioned 32nd in the metric assessment, meaning that it has great potential for a locally managed decentralized circular economy with informal recycling waste management approaches. Uganda has a population of 38.3 million, with a growth rate of 3.22% in 2016 48. The size of the country is slightly smaller in area than the U.S. state of Oregon 46. The nation has abundant natural resources, fertile soil, sufficient rainfall, and small deposits of precious minerals and oil 48. Consequently, agriculture and service sectors employ a combined 78.9% of the population, with coffee revenues accounting for the majority of the exports 48. Nonetheless, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency reports that Uganda is facing economic challenges due to sharp increase in refugees from South Sudan, high energy costs, inadequate transportation and energy infrastructure, insufficient budgetary discipline, and corruption 48. Furthermore, during 2015 and 2016, the Uganda shilling depreciated 50% against the U.S. dollar 48. Moreover, the nation's GDP per capita is equivalent to 2100 USD, with 9.4% unemployment rate and 19.7% of the population below poverty line 48. This along with only 15% of the total population having access to electricity, and 19.1% population having access to sanitation facilities, has further led to very high risks of major infectious diseases 48. Despite these challenges, the nation is poised as a good fit for implementation of decentralized waste management solutions, offering opportunities to recycle plastic waste locally, creating jobs and reducing the spread of diseases due to accumulation of trash. A case study conducted in Uganda at the Kiteezi landfill in the capital city of Kampala reveals some insight on how the proposed metric has been employed for this region. In 2015, the population of Kampala was reported to be approximately 1.9 million, with 70% of the citizens living in informal settlements scattered around the city 48, 49. However, as the country's capital, it is the home of major markets and a wide assortment of job opportunities which leads to a doubling of the city's population during the day 48, increasing waste generation. Therefore, small‐scale decentralized AT solutions to waste management are suggested for this city with both the community's and waste pickers' participation. Currently, the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA), a governmental solid waste management organization, provides collection and cleanup services to the city's five divisions (a total 210 km2 area) 48, contracting collection of waste from affluent areas to private companies 49, 50. Hence, the affluent areas are charged a waste collection fee, while the rest of the urban population is serviced by KCCA at no cost 49. KCCA further manages the city's 36‐acre 25‐m tall landfill site at Kiteezi, where both KCCA and private sector waste collection vehicles unload MSW, excluding industrial waste, free of charge 49, 50. At present, a total of 1300–1500 MT of MSW per day are landfilled, about half of the total waste generated by the city 50. This means that the other half is openly dumped in areas inaccessible to waste collection vehicles, including drainage channels, wetlands, natural water courses, manholes, undeveloped plots, or on the roadside 50-52. This is a strong indication that consumer involvement and decentralized solutions to waste accumulation are needed. The composition of the waste mainly consists of bio‐degradable food and garden waste (71.4%), stones and debris (8.6%), plastics (7.8%), paper (2.7%), glass and metals (1.5%), textiles (1.3%), and others (6.7%) 37. KCCA spends approximately 13.4 USD/MT for waste collection and disposal services 49. Waste to energy solutions and organized recycling services are not yet offered by KCCA. Nonetheless, small independently operated recycling drop‐offs exist in the city's districts. As these recycling drop‐offs are new to the city, each district only has one thus far, handling merely 3–4 tons of waste per week. Consequently, most of the waste is sent to the Kiteezi landfill, where it is informally sorted for recycling by waste pickers. With 500 in number, the organized community of waste pickers who live surrounding the landfill collect anything that has a well‐developed market, such as construction tarps, plastic bottles, paper, glass, and metals 49. More specifically, the plastic waste that is recycled by the waste pickers is purchased by domestic and international organizations that pay the pickers 500 UGX/kg. A waste picker typically collects around 40 kg/day of plastic, earning 20,000 UGX/day, which is higher than the average city dweller, who earns around 4,500 UGX/day 49. However, the waste pickers do not collect soft plastics (composition 3.8% of total MSW) 50, such as polyethylene shopping bags—known locally as kaveera s—as they do not have a ready recycling market. Furthermore, despite the ban on production of plastic bags in the country, similar to 15 other African nations 53-55, lenient governmental enforcement allows for illegal selling of the polyethylene bags 55. Consequently, the kaveeras are likely to continue to accumulate in the Kiteezi landfill in the coming years unless action is taken. Therefore, we recommend that close‐coupled decentralized circular economy of plastic be encouraged via strategies such as conversion of polyethylene shopping bags and other soft plastics to fuel oil and similar products through AT 7, 8, 34, 35. This is a viable solution that can further create employment opportunities. Using the statistics previously mentioned, roughly 49,400 kg of soft plastics are brought to the Kiteezi landfill per day. If 40 kg/day of soft plastic waste can be picked by an individual, a resulting 1235 additional jobs could be created at the Kiteezi site. Because the amount of soft plastics brought to the landfill are only half of that generated within the city, a similar opportunity exists for local citizens, entrepreneurs, and communities to recycle the waste plastic to fuel, creating additional jobs. The amount of fuel generated could be used as a substitute for kerosene and diesel applications, especially for cooking, lighting, generators, and farming machinery 34. This establishment of a locally managed decentralized circular economy could potentially have a monumental impact on the accumulation of nondegradable soft plastic accumulation at the Kiteezi landfill and in the Kampala city, improving the aesthetics of the region, and providing entrepreneurial and job opportunities, which will eventually benefit the entire nation 34. Thus, by employing the perspective metric established in this research, the results of this case study serve as an example for other nations. The metric's use of sustainability‐focused indicators can assist in identifying a region's potential suitability for a locally managed decentralized circular economy for waste plastic management.",N/A,2018.12
784,"FBRA Affirms Recycling Crucial to Environmental Preservation, Job and","The Food and Beverage Recycling Alliance (FBRA) has emphasised that recycling of waste, especially those of food and beverage packaging is vital in environmental preservation as the value chain in the recycling process leads to job and wealth creation.

According to FBRA Vice Chairman, Adekunle Olusuyi, who spoke at the two-day 12th National Stakeholders’ Forum of the National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency (NESREA) in Abuja on Thursday, the Alliance has been intensifying awareness on separation of waste and environmental pollution, especially on post-consumer polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles which can further be recycled to other useful products.

Olusuyi, who attended the forum with other FBRA members, explained that FBRA participation in the summit was in line with the Alliance’s commitment to the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policy of the government, to help build a sustainable healthy environment that leads to business growth.

“We are looking at the entire packaging lifecycle – from how bottles and cans are designed and made, to how they are recycled and repurposed. We want to reduce the waste we generate as much as possible, encourage recycling, and our initiatives in this regard have been well tailored in achieving tangible results along with our partners,” he stated.

The stakeholders’ forum, which had the theme, Circular Economy and Environmental Governance, provided a platform for an in-depth discussion and array of issues focusing on Circular Economy and Environmental Governance, as well as critical factor in attaining sustainable development in the national development plan.

It also enabled stakeholders highlight waste-to-wealth initiatives, review progress in the implementation of the EPR programme, strengthen policies and regulations to enable the recycling of food grade packaging waste materials by establishing a national standards for recycled PET and determine how Producer Responsibility Organisations (PRO) can support in waste management for a healthy environment, recycling roles, among others.

The FBRA vice chairman avowed that in a circular economy, proper waste management which involves different stages leads to job and wealth creation along the value chain.

According to Olusuyi, a recent survey indicates that the volume of post-consumer PET waste is over 800,000 tonnes which requires the participation of all stakeholders at the different stages to drive a robust circular economy.

“The various roles in waste management starts from waste separation, the collection which our partner, RecyclePoints takes care of, to separation, transportation, shredding at the recycling plants, production of other products and re-use. At these stages, different jobs are created, whether directly or indirectly,” Olusuyi explained.

He, therefore, urged other companies in the food and beverage sector, to be part of the Alliance which has sworn in its resolve to protect the environment and help make the world packaging problem a thing of the past.

In moving towards a circular economy, the Technical Lead, FBRA, Nwamaka Onyemelukwe, who represented the Chairman, Sade Morgan pointed out that the Alliance, as a PRO, will help improve recycling rates and apply the global marketing muscle of its members to help educate the public on what, how and where to recycle their food and beverage packaging waste.

The Alliance will continue to partner with local communities, non-government organisations (NGOs), industry peers and consumers to help make recycling easier and more accessible for everyone by improving collection systems, local recycling systems and driving policy change that supports a truly circular economy.

“As part of FBRA ambitious goal towards a cleaner environment, it has concluded plans to clean up the waterways in collaboration with its partner, RecyclePoints and the Ministries of Transportation as well as Environment in Lagos state, she said.

Onyemelukwe added that with an estimated annual growth rate of 2.6 percent in Nigeria, there is an increase in the level of consumption which has translated to rise in the volume of the waste generation that needs to be well tackled; hence FBRA has been embarking on various initiatives towards a cleaner environment.

Recently, the Alliance received accolades from the Lagos State Government through the Ministry of the Environment during a clean-up exercise at the Arena Market in Oshodi, Lagos, in commemoration of this year’s World Cleanup Day.

Founded in 2013, FBRA consists of responsible forward-thinking companies with a shared concern for the environment which includes; Nigerian Bottling Company Limited/ Coca-Cola Nigeria Limited; Nigerian Breweries Plc; Seven-Up Bottling Company Limited; Nestle Nigeria Plc and Guinness Nigeria Plc.",Denmark,2018.12
785,Year Ender - Looking into progress in Indonesia-EU cooperation - ANTARA News,"Tangerang, Banten (ANTARA News) - The European Union (EU) and Indonesia have developed cooperation agreements in various sectors in the past several years as outlined in the European Union-Indonesia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA).

 

 The 3rd Joint Committee was already formed in the framework of the European Union-Indonesia PCA on December 11, 2018 in Brussels, Belgium. The meeting was opened and jointly chaired by Director General for American and European Affairs of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Muhammad Anshor and Managing Director for Asia and Pacific of the European External Action Service Gunnar Wiegand.

 

 On that occasion, the EU conveyed condolence on the tragic losses of many lives in the natural disasters in Lombok and Palu and expressed solidarity and support in the process of recovering the devastated areas.

 

 Muhammad Anshor said that at the meeting of the 3rd Joint Committee the EU and Indonesian delegations reviewed the existing cooperation and considered initiative to promote cooperation in various fields in the future.

 

 Concerning cooperation in security, the Third Meeting of the Indonesia-EU Security Dialog which was held in Jakarta on November 29 in 2018 recorded an increase in interactions and bilateral cooperation over the issues related to security as reflected in the comprehensive agenda such as in Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP), maritime security, counter terrorism, organized crimes, narcotics policy, disaster control, and consulate protection.

 

 Meanwhile, the EU and Indonesia commemorated the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Both sides welcomed open and constructive exchange of information during the annual event of the Human Rights Dialog and the two-day seminar with theme ""Addressing Hate Speech and Disinformation with a Rights-based Approach"" in October, 2018 in Jakarta. The next Human Right Dialog of Indonesia-EU would be held in Brussels in 2019.

 

 In addition, the EU and Indonesia have recorded progress in the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (I-EU CEPA), which aims to open big potential of bilateral cooperation in investment, growth and sustainable development. The 7th round of negotiations would take place in Brussels in March 11-15 in 2019.

 

 Both sides expressed satisfaction with the increase in the involvement of and cooperation in ""circular economy"" and maritime fields. Circular economy is an alternative to traditional linear economy (make, use, cast off), and be replaced with activities keeping resources, for sustainability, extract maximum value from resource when used and recover and regenerate products and material at the end of each cycle of process.

 

 On palm oil issue, the EU explained attempt already taken concerning Delegated Act under the Renewable Energy Directive II (RED II). In reaction to that the government of Indonesia stressed the importance of palm oil for the country`s economy and policy to ensure the sustainability aspect of palm oil.

 

 The Indonesian government then expressed concern with the EU policy of RED II and Delegated especially with the use of the criteria ""Low Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) risk"" as the basis of development of new certificate for conventional bio-fuel. The policy in Indonesia`s view, tended to discriminate against palm oil in favor of other bio-fuel products. Therefore, the government of Indonesia and the EU agreed to continue cooperation in the important and sensitive issue.

 

 The government of Indonesia appreciated the decision of the European Commission in June 2018 to lift all certificated airlines in Indonesia from the black list of EU Safety List after improvement made in the system of flight safety meeting the international standards.

 

 Anshor said Indonesia and the EU appreciate the quality of development cooperation being in progress in the good governance, reformation of public fund management, climate change and trade-related assistance.

 

 One example of progress made in development cooperation by the two sides is in blended finance project with development banks of the member countries of the EU supporting key reform and ""One Platform SDG"" of Indonesia.

 

 Indonesia and the EU also welcomed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the European Investment Bank and the government of Indonesia, which determines financing frame for key investment projects in the green infrastructure sector.

 

 In the issue of environment and climate change, the EU and Indonesia see the efforts to achieve the target of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and steps to mitigate impact of climate change as an important goal.

 

 Therefore, in the second Working Group on the Environment and Climate Change in March, 2018, in Brussels, the EU and Indonesia discussed in particular the low emission policy, long term climate strategy, sustainable finance, adaptation strategy, fauna and flora diversity, forestry, circular economy and cooperation under G20 related to topics of mutual interest.

 

 Both sides also specially recorded the final report of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in urgent requirement to promote cooperation, ambition and implementation of climate action.

 

 The EU and Indonesia have succeeded in reaching Voluntary Partnership Agreement for the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT), which begin to be effective two years earlier. The agreement constituted a successful scheme in the global struggle against illegal felling of trees and trade of timber products.

897,Poland to go ‘circular’: gov’t minister,"Poland aims to move toward a resource-efficient “circular economy,” a government minister declared on Wednesday.

Jadwiga Emilewicz, minister for technology and enterprise, was referring to a system in which raw materials and products are extensively reused and waste is minimised.

She was speaking during a panel discussion held as part of the United Nations’ COP24 climate change conference in the southern Polish city of Katowice.

A circular economy is one in which raw materials are used for as long as possible and innovation helps improve the quality of products and extend their shelf life, Emilewicz told an audience of officials, researchers and environmentalists gathered in the Polish national pavilion at the COP24 conference.

“After all, what we want is for there to be less waste,"" she said at the discussion, entitled “Circular Economy and Climate Change: Poland’s Contribution to the Implementation of the Paris Agreement,” during the climate summit’s Innovation Day on Wednesday.

Poland’s Deputy Environment Minister Sławomir Mazurek seconded that a move toward a circular economy would ensure greater success in reducing hazardous emissions.

Thousands of decision makers from around the world have flocked to Katowice for the UN climate change conference, which opened on Monday.

The 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, also known as COP24, runs in the southern Polish mining city until December 14.

The summit aims to adopt a roadmap for putting into practice the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which seeks to slow climate change, public broadcaster Polish Radio has reported.

Speaking at the official opening of the summit on Monday, Polish President Andrzej Duda said his country was ""ready to take its share of responsibility for international security,"" including in terms of climate policy.

Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told international leaders on Tuesday that his country was among nations leading the way in efforts to stop global warming.

141,MacArthur calls for circular approach to fix the food...,"The world needs to undergo a “food revolution” to regenerate natural resources, eliminate waste and produce healthy food without the need for harmful practices, according to a new report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

Currently, for every dollar spent on food, society pays two dollars in health, environmental, and economic costs, the Cities and Circular Economy for Food report found. Half these costs – totalling US$5.7tn each year globally – are due to the way food is produced.

Hidden killers caused by industrial food production are making healthy eating impossible for people around the world, the report warns, adding that excessive use of pesticides, antibiotics in livestock farming, and poor management of fertilisers, could lead to 5 million deaths a year globally by 2050.

The current food system has supported a fast-growing population and fuelled economic development and urbanisation, yet the report says these productivity gains have come at a cost, and the model is no longer fit to meet longer term needs.

It claims that eliminating waste and improving health through the circular economy could be worth US$2.7tn a year to the global economy.

Cities are key to this food revolution, according to the report. By 2050 they will consume 80% of food, giving them the power to drive the shift to a healthier system.

The report suggests that as part of a food revolution waste products should be transformed into new products ranging from organic fertilisers and biomaterials to medicine and bioenergy; food should be grown regeneratively, and locally where appropriate; and healthier food products should be designed and marketed.

It says that realising the vision at scale will require unprecedented collaboration between food brands, producers, retailers, city governments, waste managers, and other urban food actors.

“The way we produce food today is not only extremely wasteful and damaging to the environment, it is causing serious health problems,” said Ellen MacArthur. “It cannot continue in the long term. We urgently need to redesign the system. People around the world need food that is nutritious, and that is also grown, produced and delivered in a way that benefits their health, the environment and the economy.”",N/A,2019.01
231,"£1M UKRI grant to develop ""Cambridge Centre for Circular Economy Approaches to Plastic Waste"" — Department of Physics","A new £1M grant from UK Research and Innovation has just been awarded to develop the 'Cambridge Centre for Circular Economy Approaches to Plastic Waste', with the aim to facilitate inter disciplinary projects to tackle the challenge of plastic waste. The 18-month project involves partners from many University of Cambridge departments: Asian and Middle Eastern Studies, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Chemistry, Engineering, Materials, Physics, and Zoology. The Centre will run a number of events to engage a wide range of stakeholders to align the research with real-world challenges and maximize the impact.

Professor Jeremy J Baumberg, FRS will be leading one of the projects on recycling plastic waste to produce high value 3D printing filament. One of the major barriers for 3D printing in low resource areas is availability of printing filament. At the same time, many of these regions have a problem with plastic waste; the aim of this project to tackle both of these problems through developing recycled plastic filament suitable for locally making 3D printed products. The project will include partners in Africa to produce laboratory instruments such as microscopes.",N/A,2019.01
273,"Reduce, reuse, and recycle: can we achieve a global circular economy?","This week in an interesting commentary published on 9 January in Nature, three international researchers― Prof Yong Geng from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China, Prof Joseph Sarkis from the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in the US and Hanken School of Economics in Finland, and Prof Raimund Bleischwitz from University College London in the UK ― have called for a global initiative to advance the circular economy (1).

According to the authors, an international platform should be set up to share data and experiences, and coordinate industrial policies and trade in an effort to conserve resources and energy. They suggest the initiative should be led by the United Nations and involve G20 countries, the World Economic Forum, industry and citizen-oriented organizations.

Many manufacturing and production processes are hugely wasteful. But where does all the waste go? Only six per cent of materials is currently recycled. Each year 8 million tonnes of plastic are being dumped into oceans, discarded plastics and electronics contaminate soil and water, greenhouse-gas emissions are running rampant, and precious freshwater resources are used up by inefficient farming practices. The global demand for resources is set to double by 2050 and should, therefore, be more sustainably managed before they run out.

China and South Korea have been using the principles of the circular economy for the past two decades and other countries, including European Union nations, have made genuine efforts to boost markets for secondary materials and promote reuse. However, most of these projects act independently, which results in a relatively small impact on overall global waste management ― “circular-economy networks are too small.”

The authors highlight four important aspects of the circular economy: products should be designed as recyclable and reusable and based on clean manufacturing methods; companies should develop new business models that create both private and public value; company and consumer networks should be linked to promote reuse of key products such as cars; policies must be supportive of the circular economy.

Furthermore, an international policy that integrates circular-economy approaches would contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including those related to water, energy, economic growth, and climate change. At present, limited data exist on the flows and stocks of most materials and on the costs and efficiencies of industrial processes, which makes it difficult to estimate the benefits and create policies.

In light of this, the researchers argue for a global strategy and outline the following five steps:
• A global database run by international organizations could first be set up to capture links between resource uses, including flows of materials, water and energy, as well as information on stocks in the built environment, production costs, and market trends.
• A global platform should be established to share knowledge about the circular economy, similar to the global Green Growth Knowledge Platform in Seoul, set up by the World Bank, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to share knowledge on sustainable economic practices.
• International alliances could be developed to promote governance and financial innovations for sectors, such as water, energy, food, mobility, and construction.
• Harmonized standards must be defined for areas including performance measurement, reporting, accounting, and future products, potentially based on based on environmental and corporate social responsibility systems.
• Finally, voluntary regulatory and reporting initiatives should be set up on a global scale to enforce regulations, settle disputes, and implement sanctions.

According to the researchers, funding could initially come from supportive nations such as China, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom and supplemented by industries, with additional funding streams generated by levies on purchases of company shares and sovereign wealth funds. The authors write, “The circular-economy principles would help organizations to hedge against volatility in the prices of commodities such as copper and rebalance flows of goods, scrap and used products.”

539,"Convenience, sustainability, personalization key trends shaping growth of online grocery in Saudi Arabia","JEDDAH — Tetra Pak, the world›s leading food processing and packaging solutions company, released it’s 11th annual Tetra Pak Index, which highlights Convenience, Sustainability, Personalization, Uniqueness, Technology and Performance, as the top trends shaping the growth of online grocery shopping.



With online grocery shopping in Saudi Arabia on the rise, traditional stores are being reinvented, merging together into an omnichannel where consumers expect to be able to buy whenever, wherever and however they choose, with the smartphone as their compass.



According to Statisa.com, 71 percent of the Saudi population are Internet users, out of which 12.94 million are E-commerce users with an additional 6.34 million expected to shop online by 2022. In 2018, 23 million people in Saudi Arabia accessed the Internet through their mobile phone.



The Tetra Pak Index 2018 highlights the key trends shaping the growth of on-line grocery:



Convenience: The main driver for on-line consumer take-up, as time-crunched consumers look for new ways to make their life easier. Key opportunities include easy product replenishment, voice, and convenient packaging.



28 percent of Saudi consumers are aware and would like to try the auto-replenishment service and 29% are interested in voice ordering through artificial intelligence technology.
• Sustainability



Pressure on plastic and awareness of the circular economy will continue to grow, and recycling will become ever more important. Consumers want to know whether brands are ‘doing the right thing’.
• Personalization & uniqueness



Customization of products and personalization in the consumer journey will be important differentiators going forward. This is accelerating the direct-to-consumer trend and as many as 80% of consumer-packaged goods companies are predicted to migrate to this model by 2025. In Saudi Arabia, 76 per cent of consumers perceive unboxing as a fun time and the aesthetics of the cardboard box are part of it.
• Technology & performance



Super-fast delivery in as little as 10 minutes is expected by 2025, changing consumer behavior to buy more frequently and in smaller amounts, adding more complexity to the logistics. Supply chains will continue to be transformed by a raft of technologies, notably radio-frequency identification (RFID) and robotics, boosting efficiency and transparency



Niels Hougaard, Managing Director Tetra Pak Arabia Area, said: “The rise of on-line grocery is a great opportunity for food and beverage brands, and packaging plays a key role in supporting their success. In particular, smart packaging helps drive greater transparency and efficiency in the supply chain, up and down stream, while also enabling a direct, interactive relationship with the consumer in this market“



According to Tetra Pak Index 2018, packaging will play an important role in response to the trends that are shaping the growth of on-line grocery. Smart packaging technologies based on unique digital codes will take both online and off-line grocery in exciting new directions during the next few years. — SG",Saudi Arabia,2019.02

736,Labor Announces Plan To Outlaw Single Use Plastic Bags In Australia By 2021,"The federal Labor party have today announced a plan that will see lightweight single use plastic bags and microbeads outlawed in Australia by 2021, as part of a series of environmental policies.

The plan represents a bid to reduce the amount of waste generated by Australians and protect wildlife, and is part of a proposed $290 million spend to clean up the country for future generations.

In a joint announcement today, Labor leader Bill Shorten, senators Penny Wong and Kim Carr and environment spokesman Tony Burke said:

“Australians want action from government to help reduce waste and build a circular economy. So while many Australians do their duty – they recycle, compost, use keep cups for their morning coffee – we need the government to take a leading role to tackle some of the big, structural problems.”

If Labor wins at the next federal election, it will consult with state and territory governments, many of whom have already moved to phase out single use plastic bags, on how to introduce the ban.

In 2018, major supermarket chains Coles and Woolworths voluntarily phased out lightweight single use plastic bags in their stores across the country, and were joined by many other retailers.

Lightweight bags are currently outlawed in all states and territories except for Victoria, which is set to ban them by the end of next year, and New South Wales.

Microbeads, small plastic particles which are typically used in exfoliating and other cosmetics products, were subject to a voluntary industry phase-out, the cutoff date for which was July 2018.

As of early last year, 80% of cosmetics companies operating in Australia had phased them out, with the remaining 20% reformulating their products to meet the July cutoff date.

As such, Labor’s bid seems like more of a plan to solidify a process that’s already underway, but a nationwide ban on such plastic products will help ensure that nothing slips through the cracks.

Other planned environmental initiatives include a commitment of $15 million to assist neighbouring Pacific nations in cleaning up plastic waste from the ocean.",Tuvalu,2019.03

933,Disassembly and deconstruction analytics system (D-DAS) for construction in a circular economy,"Despite the relevance of building information modelling for simulating building performance at various life cycle stages, Its use for assessing the end-of-life impacts is not a common practice. Even though the global sustainability and circular economy agendas require that buildings must have minimal impact on the environment across the entire lifecycle. In this study therefore, a disassembly and deconstruction analytics system is developed to provide buildings’ end-of-life performance assessment from the design stage. The system architecture builds on the existing building information modelling capabilities in managing building design and construction process. The architecture is made up of four different layers namely (i) Data storage layer, (ii) Semantic layer, (iii) Analytics and functional models layer and (iv) Application layer. The four layers are logically connected to function as a single system. Three key functionalities of the disassembly and deconstruction analytics system namely (i) Building Whole Life Performance Analytics (ii) Building Element Deconstruction Analytics and (iii) Design for Deconstruction Advisor are implemented as plug-in in Revit 2017. Three scenarios of a case study building design were used to test and evaluate the performance of the system. The results show that building information modelling software capabilities can be extended to provide a platform for assessing the performance of building designs in respect of the circular economy principle of keeping the embodied energy of materials perpetually in an economy. The disassembly and deconstruction analytics system would ensure that buildings are designed with design for disassembly and deconstruction principles that guarantee efficient materials recovery in mind. The disassembly and deconstruction analytics tool could also serve as a decision support platform that government and planners can use to evaluate the level of compliance of building designs to circular economy and sustainability requirements.",N/A,2019.03

16,‘Circular economy’ could save GCC cities $138bn over a decade,"By minimising waste and making the most of resources through a circular economy, GCC cities could save $138 billion (Dh507 billion) and 148 million tonnes of C02 emissions between 2020 and 2030, according to the managing director at Strategy&, Middle East.

Speaking at the London Business School Middle East conference in west London on Friday, George Sarraf said: “There is a population growth in the Middle East that is very much concentrated in the cities. The focal point of the economy is very much skewed to very few cities and at the same time, those cities are generating a huge amount of waste and inefficiencies.”

A circular economy is one that focuses on a regenerative approach to achieve cost savings, through recycling and repairing.

“We have benchmarked factors like electricity consumption, water consumption and level of recycling across different cities and the numbers for the Middle East are quite concerning in some aspects,” he said.

This has been driven by policies that have been in place for a long time that either made resources too cheap or did not prioritise efficiency.

Strategy&, the consulting team at accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, reviewed a sample of 330 cities and looked at how to optimise resources, improve recycling and streamline manufacturing to save costs.

The model looked at three elements: built environment, mobility and community. Built environment covers housing and commercial infrastructure, mobility covers public transport, personal cars and traffic; community includes housing infrastructure, electricity and water and recycling.

Mr Sarraf also compared green field and brown field infrastructure products – whether new buildings are built on new land or land where there is existing infrastructure. The Strategy& executive said it will initially be easier to implement a circular economy in green field infrastructure projects, as there are no existing buildings or policies in place. He adds that resources like electricity and water will equally impact both brown field and green field projects, because their policy is determined on national level.”

Mega cities planned in the region, such as Duqm in Oman and Neom in Saudi Arabia, could also present opportunities to strengthen the economy, says the executive.

Speaking to The National on the sidelines of the conference, Junaid Iqbal, managing director at ride hailing app Careem, said that in mega cities, the business “needs serve every price point” and branch out of normal taxi services.

In some of the larger cities, like Karachi or Cairo, 25% of Careem’s revenues come coming from bike riding services. In Cairo, a significant amount of Careem’s revenues come from working with bus businesses too.

“When you look at megacities, you have to solve for everything,” he said. “If you go from neighbourhood to neighbourhood, there will be neighbourhoods in Karachi in Pakistan that look like the first world and others that look truly third world.”

“Being a technology player, you have to be the one that bridges that gap between them and all and is agnostic to income levels. You try and design your service so that it can help the economic process for all.”",United Arab Emirates,2019.03

162,Coca Cola cleans up for turtles,"COCA COLA, Caribbean Bottlers, the Ministry of Public Utilities Adopt a River and other environmental stakeholders gathered on Thursday at Green Meadows in Santa Cruz, and pledged to do everything they could to protect the turtles, who will be coming onto TT shores during the current nesting season to lay eggs and produce the next generation of turtles.

Speaking on the meeting yesterday, Sanjay Jagrup, Health and Safety manager of Caribbean Bottlers Ltd, told Newsday that, from what he had seen in the meeting, there was a growing industry for recycling plastic.

“We closed the meeting with a tour of several recyclers who actually used recycled plastic to manufacture chairs and benches,” said Jagrup, “There is a growing industry that uses recycled plastics and if falls in line with our push for a circular economy.”

He said at the meeting there were several companies which used recycled plastic as one of their raw materials for production.

“Yesterday (Thursday) we saw companies that actually manufacture items using recycled plastic. We saw Flying Tree, a company which does concrete pavers, plant pots, benches concrete mix with plastic bottles. They use plastic and mix it with the concrete so they would use less concrete. Another company is taking the same plastic bottles and they are making benches and coffee tables. They are very sturdy, they look good and they are using plastic as their raw material,” Jagrup said.

The commitment made on Thursday saw government, non-governmental bodies and private companies come together for the benefit of the turtles. The several bodies agreed on working together in cleaning up the beaches around the nesting areas and educating people the dangers of pollution.

“Presently it is nesting season so we will be doing clean up in the nesting areas,” Jagrup said, “The second is the education factor in terms of making people aware of the importance of recycling and not disposing their garbage at beaches or rivers and what damage it does to turtles. Thirdly we will be placing bins at beaches around nesting areas and partner with I care and SWMCOL in collection at those bins.”

Jagrup added that Coca Cola and Caribbean Bottlers will be providing the bins, which is a practise the company is accustomed to doing. Jagrup pointed out Caribbean Bottlers and Coca Cola had already been doing something similar on the coastline for more than a decade with an international coastline clean-up initiative which takes place every year in September.

“Last year we did 12 beach clean ups with secondary schools where we removed 6000 pounds of garbage,” Jagrup said.",Trinidad and Tobago,2019.04
195,Circular economy could reduce plastic pollution,"The country’s war against plastic pollution has been given a big boost following an agreement between two organisations.

Coinciding with Earth Day, the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment and the Coalition of Innovation in Recycling towards a Closed Loop Economy (Coalition Circle) will work together to introduce an efficient recycling model for plastic bottles, beverage cartons and other packaging.

Both parties expressed their commitment to develop a circular economy model to tackle plastic and packaging waste pollution by improving collection and recycling systems.

As part of the initiative, a pilot project will be launched to test the economic and environmental impact of plastic and packaging materials. The results from the study will be used to develop programmes to fast-track sustainability solutions to improve waste management infrastructure.

“Statistics indicate that nearly 13 million tonnes of plastic enters the world’s oceans every year, causing annual ecological losses of over $13 billion (around AED 47 billion) to marine ecosystems. It is also expected that there will be more plastic in the oceans than fish by 2050,” said Dr Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, minister of Climate Change and Environment.

“Recognising the gravity of this issue and in a bid to address the root cause of plastic pollution, the UAE government is taking active measures to shift towards a more plastic-circular economy and adopt environment-friendly waste management solutions.

238,World needs to tackle e-waste challenge,"A toxic flood of electric and electronic waste that is growing by the day across the world should be urgently converted into a source of decent work that can also protect populations from its harmful effects, says the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the suggestion is immensely sensible.Governments, workers and employer organisations reached an agreement at a meeting of the ILO in Geneva recently urging that “at all levels” countries should look to increase and invest in better waste management infrastructure and systems to deal with the rapidly growing flows of e-waste in ways that advance decent work.There is immense business opportunity in the e-waste sector, but a more integrated, innovative and safe system of work needs to be evolved.A major cause of worry is that most workers are unaware of the major risks associated with handling e-waste. No proper safety precautions are taken in most cases. Several instances have been noticed of workers even breaking hazardous material with their bare hands.The world produces as much as 50 million tonnes of e-waste a year, and although it is valued at more than $60 billion, only 20 per cent of e-waste is formally recycled, according to ILO.It is now an increasingly important resource for the informal work sector. Along the e-waste value chain, they recover, refurbish, repurpose and recycle electrical and electronic equipment, bringing innovative services to the market, aiding the whole “circular” recycling economy.A joint report by seven UN entities, entitled, “A New Circular Vision for Electronics – Time for a Global Reboot,” earlier called for a new vision for e-waste based on the “circular economy” concept, whereby a regenerative system can minimise waste and energy leakage.A deliberative process must be instilled to change the system – one that collaborates with major brands, small and medium-sized enterprises, academia, trade unions and civil society.Considerable work is already under way to harness a circular economy. For example, the Nigerian Government, the Global Environment Facility and UN Environment earlier announced a $2 million investment to formalise an e-waste recycling industry in Nigeria. The investment will leverage over $13 million in additional financing from the private sector.India is among the top five e-waste generating countries besides China, the United States, Japan and Germany. India is likely to generate 5.2 million tonnes of e-waste per year by 2020, up from 2 million tonnes in 2016, as per a joint study by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India, ASSOCHAM, and Ernst & Young Associates.Digital transformation, social and economic growth, rapid technology advances and dumping of trash by developed countries have been cited as main factors leading to rapid growth of e-waste.As far as the UAE is concerned, the country is fully aware of the challenge e-waste poses and takes serious and effective measures to deal with the situation.An Integrated Waste Management system has been established, aiming to meet the UAE’s ambitious target of diverting 75 per cent of all municipal solid waste away from landfills by 2021 as outlined in the National Agenda of the UAE Vision 2021.On the global front, there is no doubt that more needs to be done to better manage the millions of tonnes of e-waste produced each year. Complacency on the matter could prove perilous.",United Arab Emirates,2019.04
267,Life Cycle Assessment design concepts that support implementation of Circular Economy in the construction sector,"Circular Economy (CE) is by design a restorative and regenerative industrial economy model. CE promotes resource efficiency by recycling to reduce waste and minimize negative environmental impacts. As the construction industry is responsible for approximately 35% of the world’s waste CE is central in the effort to improve the construction industries resource efficiency. 



The overall objective of the PhD project is to generate research‐based knowledge and integrated design concepts that support the implementation of CE in the building sector to optimize the environmental performance of buildings and building materials. The vision is to develop simple dissemination approaches based on comprehensive data on environmental performance to support and facilitate a sustainable building design and decision-making process based on quantitative indicators however without introducing further and potentially excessive complexity to the process.",Denmark,2019.04

395,UAE scales new heights on sustainability,"Progress and prosperity are important for every nation, but they can and should be achieved through responsible actions, keeping in mind the need to preserve the precious environment.The UAE government deserves a salute for becoming the first signatory in the world to the ‘Scale 360’ initiative, which aims at moving towards a more circular economy while using less natural resources and reducing pollution to tackle climate change.The move, in cooperation with the World Economic Forum on the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), will go a long way in minimising waste by designing recyclable and renewable goods to ensure their utilisation even after the end of their shelf- life and in order to achieve efficient use of natural resources.The initiative, signed from the UAE side by Dr Thani Bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, Minister of Climate Change and Environment, and Omar Bin Sultan Al Olama, Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, and Borge Brende, President of the World Economic Forum, translates the strategic directions of the UAE government into practical initiatives by creating an enabling a sustainable infrastructure to support the growth of the economic, social and environmental sectors.As Dr Thani Al Zeyoudi stated, the UAE’s success in linking development plans with environmental considerations is the result the leadership’s endless support in promoting development while maintaining the sustainability of natural resources which contributed to a global leading model.The decision to sign the initiative is immensely creditable because the UAE seeks to promote Scale 360 to existing and future projections in order to ensure the conservation of resources, greater reliance on clean energy, the application of sustainable development standards, as well as create future opportunities for the youth in the region.Artificial Intelligence (AI) and smart technology are reshaping the future of the world. Thankfully, the UAE has not only pressed the right keys when it comes to adopting smart technology to make the lives of citizens and residents happier, it has also understood the fact that there is no time to pause.The nation has embarked on continuous upgradation at various levels of governance, keeping pace with ever-changing technology. Visionary leadership has helped lead the digitalisation race in the region.As Omar Al Olama well highlighted, the UAE’s signing on Scale 360 reflects the government’s commitment to employ the Fourth Industrial Revolution’s technologies for a better future for communities while joining the global efforts to sustain the environment for future generations.No one can deny that Artificial Intelligence is a major contributor to the sustainable development efforts and recycling initiatives.In October 2014, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, launched the National Innovation Strategy with the aim of making the UAE one of the most innovative nations in the world within seven years.Every citizen and resident can be proud of the fact that the UAE is one of the most prepared countries in the region to adopt AI technology because the government has already built a thorough technology infrastructure over the past two decades.The UAE becoming the first globally to sign on ‘Scale 360’ initiative indubitably reaffirms the country’s position as a global and an open laboratory for economic and technological innovations in line with UAE Vision 2021 and the Centennial Strategy 2071.",United Arab Emirates,2019.04
402,GPCA spreads awareness about plastic recycling at WFE campaign,"DUBAI – The Gulf Petrochemicals and Chemicals Association (GPCA) has spread awareness about the benefits of plastics and responsible resource consumption at a community outreach event supported by BASF in Dubai Festival City Mall last March 28 as part of the 7th edition of GPCA’s Waste Free Environment (WFE) campaign.



Families and visitors of different age visited GPCA’s awareness kiosk and enjoyed a wide range of activities including working with local artisans to produce handicraft from used plastics. Visitors of the mall participated in a recycling competition held by the campaign’s official recycling partner, Bee›ah, for the chance to win a special prize. With the aim to encourage plastic recycling, participants had to dispose of their unwanted plastic bottles at reverse vending machines to take part in the raffle.



The campaign has already been underway in a number of GCC locations organized by GPCA member companies, with more activities planned throughout 2019. WFE started as a regional clean-up campaign led by GPCA and supported by its members and has now transformed into a year-round global environmental movement, with over 10,310 participants in 17 cities, 11 countries and three continents taking part in WFE in 2018 alone.



Dr. Abdulwahab Al-Sadoun, Secretary General, GPCA, said “with plastics coming under increased attack due to the rising waste management challenge, the Waste Free Environment campaign comes just at the right time to spread awareness about the importance of plastic recycling and foster responsible attitude towards waste management and litter disposal. The campaign aims to reinforce the message that plastic is not to blame; on the contrary, as the most versatile, sustainable and durable material, it plays a positive contribution and delivers long term benefits to society. To prevent plastic from leaking into the environment, we need to enact a real behavioral change that starts with the actions of each and every member of our society and continues with the young generations and the generations to come.”



Waste Free Environment Campaign supports the transition to a circular economy which aims to maximize the value and utility of materials over their lifecycle and minimize energy and resource consumption. WFE contributes to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals #12: Responsible consumption and production and #14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources. It is also in line with the GCC governments’ national visions to address waste management, enhance sustainability and preserve natural resources.



Earlier that week, GPCA organized a roadshow across several schools in Dubai to build awareness about the benefits of plastics and recycling among students aged between 7-12. Sponsors of this year’s campaign include SABIC, LyondellBasell, Dow Chemicals and Cosmoplast. — SG",Saudi Arabia,2019.04

Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi, Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah, on Friday, was an eye-opening opportunity, revealing the vast potential of the emirate as a world-class hub for development.

""I am very impressed with the very coherent narrative about where Ras Al Khaimah wants to go and develop itself. His Highness was very good at explaining that he wants to put the human element at the centre, tracking talents, tracking companies and getting Ras Al Khaimah to be a world-class hub for development, he said.

The Danish Ambassador said he was also impressed when he visited Ras Al Khaimah Ceramic, a key industrial player in the emirate.

""One of the things I noticed was the coherence and the ambition all the way from His Highness to the free zone people to the individual companies, and that is confidence-inducing when you see commercial opportunities in places like Ras Al Khaimah,"" Mellbin enthused.

He said he sensed a serious business environment that offers real opportunities and it opens doors to a lot of people to consider this place for investment. ""In a world where you have stiff competition, we have Dubai and Abu Dhabi which have a larger world recognition as brands and names, it is very important for a place like Ras Al Khaimah to have these kinds of indicators to back up their business proposals and their value proposition.""

On the potentials of growth for Ras Al Khaimah, the ambassador said, ""I see potentials in two specific dimensions, one is public-private partnerships which would encompass energy, environment and circular economy. I also see an opportunity in logistics which is quite important.""

""I will be looking to have discussions with Danish companies within those three sectors. We do have companies who want to move business to Ras Al Khaimah. I will come back to them and talks to them about what I have seen here today,"" he continued, adding that there are ""awesome opportunities, but the whole port sector is very competitive. I have seen the division of labour. I see the best opportunities in moving the logistics sectors towards what people call Industry 4.0. We would like to explore more when it comes to digitisation and logistics.""

He concluded by saying Denmark wants greater diversity in its business relationships with the UAE. ""There are opportunities, we need ambitious partners at the other side of the table, and we certainly get that from His Highness, from the free zones and ports here, and from individual companies, wherever there are opportunities, we will pursue them.""",United Arab Emirates,2019.04

The BNP Paribas Easy ECPI Circular Economy Leaders UCITS ETF is listed on Euronext Paris with annual management charges (AMC) of 0.30%.

Tracking the ECPI Circular Economy Leaders Equity index, the ETF offers investors exposure to 50 international large-cap stocks that participate in the business model based on the circularity of goods, materials and commodities.

The circular economy refers to a business whose objective is to produce goods and services in a sustainable manner. Companies within this economy limit their consumption and waste of resources as well as the production of waste.

It is in direct opposition to the “linear economy” which extracts, produces, consumes and disposes of materials.

Robert-Alexandre Poujade, ESG analyst at BNPP AM, commented: “Awareness of the environmental impacts of their business models, regulatory changes in the preservation of resources push companies to adopt alternative development strategies towards a more virtuous model,

685,Circular economy concept in development in Brest Oblast,"BREST, 14 May (BelTA) – A circular economy concept is being developed in Brest Oblast. Belarusian and foreign experts discussed the potential for implementing the project during a roundtable session in Brest, BelTA has learned.

Circular economy (closed-loop economy) provides for smarter production and usage. It relies on renewing resources, recycling secondary raw materials, and transitioning from fossil fuel to renewable energy sources.

Chairman of the Economy Committee of the Brest Oblast Executive Committee Mikhail Batsenko stressed: “Brest Oblast has been chosen as a pilot territory where this project will be implemented. Two directions lie at the heart of the project. First, reducing environmental pressure by recycling all kinds of waste. Second, getting economic benefits from recycling. These goals match the national strategy of sustainable development for the period till 2030.”

The first discussion of the concept took place on 14 May. Brest gathered Belarusian and foreign experts – economists and ecologists, representatives of municipal government agencies, the relevant offices and committees, public organizations and enterprises, the Brest State Technical University, and the Baranovichi State University. Participants of the roundtable session discussed circular economy models and the potential for their development in Brest Oblast, possible risks and factors of successful development in the centers of the region's economic growth – Brest, Baranovichi, and Pinsk.

“Circular economy has a number of advantages. First of all, imported raw materials can be acquired through waste recycling. The approach considerably reduces expenses and has a much lighter environmental impact. New jobs at recycling enterprises represent another advantage. We see great potential in the sphere of food industry, production of packaging and textiles,” noted Henning Wilts, Head of the Circular Economy Department of the Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy, Germany. The expert added that interaction of major industrial hubs with surrounding areas is another factor of success of circular economy.

732,The mountain of trash thanks to a circular economy disappear – view | KXan 36 Daily News,"man Has eaten the bread, the iced tea drink or the new charging cable plugged in, is the packaging is just a Nuisance. The protective shell loses its purpose and leads to poor Ökogewissen and more effort, because you need to dispose of.

“consumers don’t want the packaging actually, you are only interested in the content. But a yogurt you can transport only-Packed home – without it is impossible or at least very cumbersome,” says Roland Hischier, life cycle assessment expert at the research institution Empa. “In particular food packaging made of solve, therefore, regularly Controversial. Although the production of the content burden on the environment is often much stronger.”

The topic of moving: a wholesale distributor to be attacked in Public regularly because of seemingly unnecessary packaging. New shops set to “Zero Waste”, zero waste, and be celebrated for it. Environmental organisations driving campaigns against plastic, and always new pictures of dead animals in the oceans of the world make consumers affected. Retailers such as Migros and Coop are therefore under pressure and try to turn with fees on plastic customer bags to move to environmental friendly behavior.

in Spite of growing environmental awareness, prosperity, and comfort for more and more garbage. About 716 kilograms of so-called municipal waste from households and businesses to fall in this country, annually per capita. Switzerland is one of the top riders in Europe, the EU average is 487 pounds per head. Worldwide, only 14 percent of plastic waste is recycled – no matter whether the packaging is recyclable or not. And still, no improvement is in sight: The Federal office for the environment predicts a further increase in the amount of waste.

What can we do about it? The search for the solution is engaged in the research, business and policy alike. For example, the food scientists Selçuk Yildirim. He is Director of the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW), the centre for food production and packaging and is researching the materials of the future.

“The most important function of packaging is to serve as a barrier between the contents and the environment,” he says. Say: carbon dioxide allowed to escape from the beverage, and it can’t penetrate through the packaging, the milk is bad. The ideal packaging combines the necessary functions with the least possible environmental damage.

what is the status of packaging to the LCA?

it is Important that the materials will be better in the future recyclable, says Yildirim: “Today, they often consist of several layers that have different characteristics: against moisture and gases, protect, beautiful printable and stability. Currently you can separate the bad from each other.” That’s why mono would be developed materials that can combine all of the properties and, thus, better for Recycling.

another focus of research is on so-called active packaging, oxygen absorbing, and thus prevent, for example, in the case of baking molds were formed. Also of antimicrobial films and edible casings is fiddled in Wädenswil. In addition, the research group of Selçuk Yildirim materials from sustainable raw materials. Special interest you have in the production of packaging waste, which is incurred anyway in the production of food. Such packaging could consist of, for example, from Gluten, whey or potato skins.

But the solution to the waste problem can’t burden on the shoulders of science. Future researcher Martina Kühne sees the most promising way in the circular economy, i.e. a System in which all waste is reused, and the responsibility for more from the producers. Resources, emissions, waste production and energy waste should be minimized by Closing Material and energy cycles. As it is, for example, the company Friday to do with compostable clothing or Food Start-up ZüriChips with Chips from old bread.

It put a lot of hope that war with such approaches, the excesses of the consumer society in the grip, says Kühne: “Today we can dispose of our waste according to the “Out of sight, out of mind”principle, anywhere in the world. But the more we slow down cycles, reduce and close, the more local you will have to deal with all the consequences of the consumption of apart and also take responsibility.” This necessitated a rethink and not be done from today to tomorrow.

economy has no other option

“A product completely sustainable, is a complex and not always feasible in the short term,” says Judith Walls, Professor for sustainability management at the University of St. Gallen. The most effective and fastest solution to the waste and packaging problem is, of course, to consume simply less.

nevertheless, she is convinced that companies will soon have no choice other than to make the Transition to the circular economy. “In the economy, a massive movement is felt, will change the way companies work.” Many Investment and insurance companies would always make higher demands on the sustainability of companies, because they do not classify it as a risk, if they take the necessary measures. “And if you stop the flow of money, the company usually pretty quickly,” says Walls.

A system change, says Thomas Dyllick, President of the Association of Prism, the different companies and retailers such as Aldi, Emmi and Unilever have joined together need to sign up for the circular economy. “The Transition is not only inevitable, but in the EU, of course, already been ushered in. Hence, it is mandatory for Switzerland, since the company can offer no separately solutions.”

the fact that the responsibility for Closing the circuit to the producer will located have this as an incentive to develop from the beginning, sensible solutions. “In the case of packaging, this means that you have to be either reusable, recyclable or compostable,” says Dyllick. The willingness to change is increasingly felt, it is the courage lacked, but still to make the big steps.

Also in the policy seems to have recognized this: The city of Geneva prohibits from 2020, disposable plastic, and also the EU has adopted such a ban. In the national Council by the end of 2018, despite Lobbying by the retail industry, a Motion that the environmental Commission approved, the less plastic waste and disposable products. With the postulates of the two Ständeräte Ruedi Noser (FDP), and Beat Vonlanthen (CVP) called on the Federal Council also recently to take advantage of the opportunities of the circular economy and to check, where barriers and tax incentives are set can be reduced.

For all the euphoria, there are also critical voices. “The circular economy is an important Vision, but this requires cooperation of many different actors, and is therefore extremely complex in implementation. Many questions are still open,” says Greenpeace spokesman Yves Zenger. The current economic system based on endless consumption and disposable culture, have devastating consequences, and a paradigm shift was necessary. Parallel to the development of the circular economy, the need to reduce urgently the sheer amount of garbage quickly.

Zenger looks to alternative delivery and distribution systems, which are based on the recovery and reusability, to tackle as the best strategy to the problem of Waste. It would be faster. “Only returnable delivery systems can stop the vicious circle of waste and pollution to break through the one-way packaging caused ecological and social catastrophe. Even if the major requires logistical changes and investments, it is more concrete and faster to implement than the implementation of the circular economy.”

It had to apply the ‘polluter pays’ principle – the responsibility lies with the consumer goods manufacturers and retailers. Today, you would feel this is still too little, and a massive fight back, as currently, the “clean rap” in Bern.

The Greenpeace spokesman says: “retailers such as Migros and Coop celebrate every single one of plastic – exempt fruit and vegetables in places open to the public. At the same time bring you more and more disposable, Convenience-packaged products on the shelf. So that you create the wrong incentives, and boost the waste of literally.”

736,Veolia Indonesia Builds the Largest Bottle to Bottle Recycling Factory in the Country,"France-based waste management company, Veolia Services Indonesia, is building the largest PET, or polyethylene terephthalate, bottle to bottle recycling and reprocessing factory located in Pasuruan district, East Java. (Photo courtesy of Danone-AQUA)

Jakarta. France-based waste management company, Veolia Services Indonesia, is building the largest PET, or polyethylene terephthalate, bottle to bottle recycling and reprocessing factory located in Pasuruan district, East Java.

Last month the company held a ""groundbreaking ceremony"" for the factory attended by Representatives of Indonesia Investment Board, Representatives of Coordinating Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Ministry of Environment and Forestry, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Marine and Fisheries, Pasuruan District officials, representative from industry associations, president director of Veolia Indonesia and president director of Tirta Investama (Danone-AQUA).

Veolia is a transnational company with strong experience and expertise in plastic recycling technology. Development of this new plastic recycling factory will make the recycling process more efficient on a larger scale to collect, select and manage plastic waste. Supported by Danone-AQUA, this factory will strengthen the recycling ecosystem and circular economy and increase the level of plastic waste collection in Indonesia.

This plastic recycling factory will be built on an area of ​​ ​​22,000 square meters with a building area of 7,000 square meters and targeted to start operations in early 2020. Each year, this factory will be able to produce 25,000 tons of recycled PET, in accordance with the applicable food safety standards in Indonesia. This factory will employ 80 local workers and machinery will be used to quickly separate the caps and labels.

""Veolia Indonesia is committed to support the government's agenda in addressing plastic waste problem, therefore we have decided to build a PET Plastic Recycling Factory in Indonesia. To secure raw materials in our operations, we will work with plastic waste collection actors in several cities in Indonesia and expected to develop an inclusive collection model that can empower the informal sector,"" President Director of Veolia Indonesia, Sven Beraud-Sudreau said.

""The government is committed to improving the good investment climate, especially waste management policies that have become an urgent agenda for the government. We really need participation from private sector to provide input and consideration in developing a good waste management system,"" Deputy of Investment Climate and Development of Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM), Farah Ratnadewi Indriani said.

""The collaboration between Veolia Indonesia and Danone-AQUA is expected to strengthen the recycling ecosystem and circular economy in Indonesia as well as being a success story that in the future can invite similar investments into the country,"" Farah added.

One of the companies that will use the recycled products from this factory is Danone-AQUA as a continuation of the agreement between the two parties. Last year, Veolia Indonesia and Danone-AQUA signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the construction of this recycling factory. This is part of Danone-AQUA's #BijakBerplastik commitment to collect more plastic waste than it produces in 2025.

""As an Indonesian born brand, AQUA has shared goodness for more than 46 years for society and environment. In addition to providing health through its products, we also contribute to social and environmental issues, including creating a cleaner Indonesia,"" president director of Danone-AQUA, Corine Tap said.

""Danone-AQUA has pioneered plastic recycling in Indonesia through PEDULI program in 1993. Currently, 70% of our business is already circular using the 19-liter gallons packaging, which is reusable and recyclable. Last year, AQUA announced its plastic pledge aiming to help solve plastic waste issue via recycling, education and innovation. AQUA also has just launched the first water bottle in Indonesia made of 100 percent recycled plastic. Partnership with Veolia Indonesia will not only help to increase recycling efforts but also to make sure that our innovative 100 percent Recycled PET packaging will get sufficient supply in the future,"" Corine explained.

In a press release Veolia said it was proud to work with strategic partners like Danone-AQUA with strong support from Indonesia Government. Veolia intends to work and call for collaboration across industries and beyond, to achieve a sustainable, large-scale change in plastic collection and recycling in Indonesia.",Indonesia,2019.05
821,Pope: mining activities should ensure integral sustainable human development - Vatican News,"Pope Francis on Friday denounced a voracious economic model that is profit-oriented, shortsighted, and based on the misconception of unlimited economic growth, saying its impacts are disastrous on the natural world and in the lives of people.

“We need to see that what is at stake is our own dignity,” he told some 60 participants in a Vatican meeting on the theme, “Mining for the Common Good”, promoted by the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development.

Citing amply from his environmental encyclical, “Laudato Si”, the Pope regretted that “economic powers continue to justify the current global system where priority tends to be given to the pursuit of financial gain, which fail to take the context into account, let alone the effects on human dignity and the natural environment.”

Pope Francis urged that mining, like all economic activities, should be at the service of the entire human community, and should involve local communities in every phase of mining projects. In this regard, he urged special care for indigenous communities and their cultural traditions, saying they are a vulnerable minority who should be the principal dialogue partners, especially in large projects affecting their land.

However, the Pope noted that in various parts of the world, they are being pressured into abandoning their homelands to make room for mining projects which are undertaken “without regard for the degradation of nature and culture.” “I urge everyone to respect the fundamental human rights and voice of the persons in these beautiful yet fragile communities.”

The Argentine Pope also urged that mining be at the service of the human person and his or her inalienable fundamental human rights, and not vice versa. “We need to ensure that mining activities lead to the integral human development of each and every person and of the entire community.”

The Pope encouraged what he called a “circular economy” in mining activities against the unbridled tendency of “extractivism” which tries to extract the greatest amount of materials in the shortest possible time and convert them into products and services that turn out polluting waste for nature.

Indicating that our industrial system has not developed the capacity to absorb and reuse waste and by-products, the Pope said, “We need to denounce and move away from this throwaway culture.” The promotion of a circular economy and the “reduce, reuse, recycle” approach, he said, are very much in consonance with the 12th Sustainable Development Goal of the United Nations.

Moderation, he said, is vital to save our common home and pointed out that religious traditions have always presented temperance as a key component of responsible and ethical lifestyle.

The Pope hoped that the meeting be able to discern what appropriate or inappropriate extractive activities are and then help propose and plan policies and strategies for the purpose of achieving the common good and genuine human development that is integral and sustainable.",Vatican City,2019.05
825,The circular economy,"IMAGINE a world where you never see a plastic bottle, container or package on the road, in the parks or in oceans and rivers. With the state of the world as it is now, where an estimated eight million metric tonnes of plastic ends up the ocean every year, what would have to be done to achieve such a goal?

Walewska Miguel, senior manager for public affairs, communications and sustainability for the Caribbean and Venezuela for Coca Cola, said the company plans to make the dream of a world without waste a reality. Speaking to Business Day last week at the Hyatt Regency Port of Spain, Miguel said Coca Cola plans to put processes in place to develop its already environmentally conscious company into one that has absolutely zero effect on the environment – and it is encouraging other major corporations to do the same. Coca-Cola is one of the most recognised brands in the world and has a presence in over 200 countries. Miguel acknowledged that the company does use a large amount of plastic for packaging, but said it is embracing the “circular economy.”

Instead of a linear economy, where you produce, use and dispose, in a circular economy you produce, use and re-use or recycle. Everything, be it a plastic bottle or aluminium can, Miguel explained, could be given a second life, even in another industry – for example, benches or the textile industry.

With this module in mind, Miguel said, Coca Cola plans to reduce the impact of its packaging on the environment to zero by the year 2030. And while the company is already making several strides toward lessening its impact on the environment, it still has a long way to go.

“We have developed great technology for reducing the impact of our packaging through things such as plant-based bottles, which we have here in TT where we are reducing the petroleum base for our plastic processes with plant-based materials. This has had a great effect in the reduction of carbon monoxide emissions,” Miguel said. “We have been working with these for quite a long time, but then we began to wonder is that enough? We continue to see waste ending up along river banks, coasts and in the ocean.”

So, Coca Cola committed to its 2030 with three pillars: innovation, collection, and partnership and education.

“By 2030, we are going to have every component of Coca Cola’s packaging 100 per cent recyclable,” Miguel said. “And by 2025, 50 per cent of the materials used to produce our bottles has to be recycled.”

Also by 2030, Coca Cola intends to be able to recover every can and bottle put on the market, and within that same time, several other companies would have modules to follow to make their businesses more environmentally sustainable, thus creating a circular economy worldwide.

Although it is a daunting task, Miguel said Coca Cola is closer to its goals than one might think. In several countries, the bottles used for water are 100 per cent recycled, and collection in several countries is high.

“We already we are recovering 50 per cent of our bottles, cans and containers worldwide. Some countries, like Mexico, the recovery rate is at about 75 per cent. We are making progress, but every market is in a different stage of development,” she said.

In TT, companies like the Solid Waste Management Company (SWMCOL) have already piloted several projects that focus on recovering and recycling plastic. The local waste management company even has its own recycling facility, a pilot project that collects plastic and breaks it down, and exports the recycled products internationally, and even sells it locally.

For now, the volume that they collect is not very high but the infrastructure is there.

Sanjay Jagrup, health, safety and environment manager for Caribbean Bottlers TT (a subsidiary of the Coca Cola Company), said several companies have also begun using recycled plastic as the main material for textiles, construction and even in decorations.

“We saw manufacturers who do the concrete pavers, plant pots, and benches out of concrete mixed with plastic. So, they grind up bottles and mix it with the concrete so it uses less concrete. That is something that could be used at home, in parks and so on. One of our workers made a centrepiece with flowers from plastic. When we went out to get quotations for the same thing we were told that it was $100 to $150 a piece. So I would say low-tier business, mid-tier businesses and major corporations could re-use plastic and make a profit out of it.”

The third pillar of Coca Cola’s sustainability goals is partnerships.

“How can we make sure that we develop these circular economy models?” Miguel asked. “We need everyone’s help. We need government to help give incentives to develop the recycling industry. We need NGOs to develop awareness and education programmes and help us with the collection process.”

She said people need to develop an attitude of the benefits of classifying waste and recycling.

“We need education to teach people to classify waste. In many countries, it is something that they have been doing for years, in others it is simply something that is not done. People do not separate glass, paper and plastic, people don’t wash bottles and so on,” Miguel said, and that takes time.

Even if Coca Cola achieves its goals for the next decade, its attempts to achieve a world without waste would only be a drop in the bucket, Miguel said, simply because Coca Cola is not the only company that uses plastic packaging. For the world to be rid of waste, she said, the entire world and not just one company has to be involved.

“Coca Cola is very committed to our environment, and developing practises that protect it, but all industries have to start working on this.”

Several other stakeholders, locally and internationally, have been introduced to the methods, and Coca Cola hopes they can use them to achieve their sustainability goals in the next ten years. Once the modules are developed and perfected, Coca Cola will encourage people and corporations to follow suit for the benefit of the environment.

“The technology is already there, we have to modules to achieve that so now we need to deploy that worldwide,” Miguel said.",Trinidad and Tobago,2019.05
10,European bank funds solid waste facility in Çanakkale - Latest News,"The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is providing a 57.5 million Turkish Lira loan (9 million euros) for waste management.

The 200,000-strong population of Çanakkale will benefit from an the for the development of a modern, efficient and sustainable waste management under a private-public partnership scheme in this historical province, the development bank said in a statement.

Çanakkale province, which stands on the Dardanelles Strait connecting the Sea of Marmara and the Aegean, is the location of ancient Troy.

The EBRD loan will be extended to a local venture between the French utility SUEZ Group and the Turkish waste management firm ALTAŞ.

The two partners have won the international tender to provide waste collection, transportation, recycling and disposal services under 29-year concession in five towns: Çanakkale, Lapseki, Kepez, Çardak and Umurbey.

The consortium is contributing 38.3 million liras of its own funds to the project.

The EBRD loan will finance the construction of a mechanical biological treatment plant which combines a sorting facility with biological treatment such as composting and producing energy from waste. The funds will also be used to refurbish a landfill and upgrade a plant that treats leachate, a water-polluting liquid.

The project will help reduce the amount of solid waste sent to landfill, extend the landfill lifetime by 20 years and increase waste recycling, in line with EU standards. The new approach is based on circular economy and will minimise the negative effects of waste on the environment and people.

Nandita Parshad, EBRD Managing Director for Sustainable Infrastructure, said during a visit to

Turkey: “At the EBRD we are strong supporters of public-private partnerships as an effective tool to deliver better services. Together with our partners from SUEZ we aim to demonstrate how effective waste management by private companies can benefit people and the environment.”

With 90 000 people on the five continents, SUEZ is a world leader providing water and waste management solutions. The Group recovers 17 million tons of waste a year, produces 3.9 million tons of secondary raw materials and 7 TWh of local renewable energy. It also secures water resources and wastewater treatment. SUEZ generated total revenues of 17.3 billion euros in 2018.

ALTAŞ provides solid waste management services in the Turkish cities of Izmir, Istanbul, Ankara and Mersin and is also active in the Lebanese capital Beirut.

The EBRD is a leading institutional investor in Turkey and has invested over 11 billion euros in 283 projects in the country since 2009.

The overwhelming majority of EBRD investments in Turkey are in the private sector. One half of the bank’s portfolio in Turkey constitutes investments that promote sustainable energy and resource use.",Turkey,2019.06
16,How camel waste is fuelling the UAE's circular economy,"On a good day, Mlah the camel produces 10 kilogrammes of manure.

This makes her an essential contributor to the UAE’s burgeoning circular economy.

In Ras Al Khaimah, the government has tied two of its biggest industries in an unlikely partnership to cut carbon emissions. Every day, more than 50 tonnes of camel manure are used as fuel in cement production.

“When we started to make an estimate, people wouldn’t believe me,” said Sonia Nasser, the executive director of the waste management agency at the RAK Public Works and Services Department. “But the first thing in creating a circular economy is, what do I have that I’m throwing away?”

The central premise of the circular economy is to minimise waste and make the most of resources.

Ras Al Khaimah had camel waste - and lots of it.

The emirate is home to roughly 9,000 camels and each produces about eight to 10 kilogrammes a day.

Instead of dumping it, the government began a programme last May to process it and give it to local cement factories as fuel.

The camel population has grown exponentially since the rise of the camel racing industry. Camels produce far more waste than farmers use to fertilise palm orchards. The excess manure was going to the landfill. When Ms Nasser suggested the programme, camel farmers were immediately supportive.

“If the government says it is a good idea and keeps things clean, then it is a good idea,” said Mlah’s owner, Saeed Al Masafari.

For cement companies, it cut costs and carbon emissions. But it took some convincing.

“When we approached people 10 years ago with alternative fuels, nobody wanted to touch it because people are very protective of the [cement production] process and the quality,” said Ms Nasser. “You really have to have a process engineer who is open minded.”

The project began in May 2018, and more than 10,000 tonnes from 6,000 camels have been diverted so far this year.

Farmers bring manure to four collection stations where it bakes in the sun. From there, the manure is taken north to Gulf Cement Company in the town of Khor Khair.

This has saved an estimated 18,000 tonnes of carbon emissions, and cut costs.

To make cement, ovens must burn at 1,400 degrees, 24 hours a day. More than 70 per cent of Gulf Cement’s production costs are heat and power. With so much energy required, cement production is one of the country’s main contributors to carbon emission.

Dried camel manure has about half the calorific value of coal, so a tonne of camel manure replaces half a tonne of coal.

“When we were introduced it had a good calorific value but the question was, how to use it and where to use it?” said Tiruneveli Palanikumar, the head of Gulf Cement’s business development.

After some experimentation, they found they it worked best mixed with coal as boiler fuel. About 8 to 10 per cent of coal is substituted with camel waste.

“Cement production is a natural incinerator,” said Mr Palanikumar. “Most of the waste we can burn. I need about 1,500 metric tonnes of fossil fuel every day. When I’m using so much fuel, 10 per cent is not a big issue.”

Similar programmes could be applied to other animals. After all, Ras Al Khaimah has more livestock than people. In addition to its camels, there are more than 317,000 goats, 81,000 sheep and 5,000 cattle.

Following the success of Gulf Cement, other cement factories want to use camel fuel and RAK hopes to expand the manure fuel project to other Emirates. There are 14 cement plants in the UAE and six are in Ras Al Khaimah. About 13,000 tonnes of coal is burned in the Northern Emirates every day.

“If you can stop using this amount of coal, there’s a whole carbon emissions trial that we’re reducing,” said Ms Nasser. “Coal is coming and being shipped all the way from South Africa to Ras al Khaimah.”

Other waste like clothing, agricultural waste and dry sludge could be alternative fuels.

Some cement factories are already substituting coal with carbon dust, a byproduct from the aluminum industry and Star Cement substitutes 10 per cent of its fuel with tyre chips.

“When people have strange materials, we call the cement factories,” said Ms Nasser. “Does it have calorific value? Instead of trying to landfill it, can we incinerate it? There’s a lot you can get rid of.”

It is part of the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment strategy to develop a circular economy and turn waste into a resource.

By 2020, all coal-burning cement factories must use local municipal, commercial and industrial waste for at least 10 per cent of total energy needs.",United Arab Emirates,2019.06

73,16 international students will study innovation in the circular economy in Slovenia and northern Italy - UP FAMNIT,"16 international students will study innovation in the circular economy in Slovenia and northern Italy

Last Monday, the third edition of Alpine Europe Summer School, which is organized every two years by the University of Primorska and the Oregon State University (USA), has started. In the next two weeks, 16 students from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czech Republic, India, Kazakhstan and the USA will study the sustainability and creation of the built environment, starting in the forest itself and following the value chain all the way through design, manufacturing and construction. Their goal is to provide not only concept and content, but to also facilitate interactions between, and learning among students coming from different countries.

The international group of participants will visit numerous companies and institutions in Slovenia and northern Italy that are focusing on sustainable products from natural materials in their production and design. From 22nd to 24th June they will also enjoy the sea breeze on the Slovenian Littoral.

After first day staying in Ljubljana, their next stops are Gozd Martuljek and Bled, where they will visit the eco-tourist green resort Garden Village. The following day they will continue their tour to the company Riko hiše in Ribnica, which produces ecological wooden prefabricated buildings. On the fourth day, they will go to M Sora in Žiri, where windows exclusively from domestic wood are produced, and in the afternoon they will reach the seaside.

On Friday, the day will start in Korte with a visit to the Logotowood family company, which manually manufactures wooden washbasins and unique furniture. After that it will be time to stop at the University of Primorska, more precisely at UP FAMNIT for a more relaxed meeting with students and the visit to InnoRenew CoE.

After Saturday’s visit to the Olive oil Factory Krožera Franca Marzi in Srgaši and to the Škocjanski zatok Nature Reserve, they will move to the north-west of Slovenia, where they will learn about the characteristics of Bovec and Kobarid. They will also visit the Kobarid Museum, which is dedicated to the events during the First World War on the Isonzo Front. In the mountain region there will be time for discovering the local cheese and have some active time along and in the Soča river.

Next Tuesday, it will be time to jump across the border to Italy. Cortina, Bressanone and Bolzano will be the next stops, while the summer school will end in Venice.

Last year, the University of Primorska, in cooperation with the Oregon State University, have organized the isMCS summer school (which can be found here), which will be hopefully organized also next year.

We wish to all participants a lot of curiosity, interesting discoveries and especially beautiful moments in our country.",Slovenia,2019.06
89,Circular Economy Bachelors Course to Be Offered for the First Time in Georgia,"Global society is at an environmental breaking point. Modern production and consumption practices have severely degraded our water, air, and soil resources, and our rate of fossil fuel extraction and emission puts society on track for catastrophic climate change. It has been projected that at our current rate of plastic consumption, by 2050 there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish (by weight). To help mitigate these environmental problems, some are calling for a redesign of the system that lies at their root, the linear economy, in favor of a more circular alternative.

Under the linear consumption economy, also referred to as the “take, make, waste” system, products are only designed for a limited lifespan and then disposed of. This applies to not only single-use products, like plastic straws and paper towels, but also to more expensive goods like clothing, smartphones, and furniture. A circular economy aims to eliminate material and energy waste by prioritizing systems of reuse, repair, and recycling.

Starting September 2019, students at the International School of Economics at Tbilisi State University (ISET) will have the opportunity to explore the principles of the circular economy and learn how business can put this framework into action. This material will be offered in a new course, “Circular Economy”, developed by International Expert Hans Wiesmeth in partnership with the USAID-funded Waste Management Technologies in the Regions (WMTR II) program implemented by CENN and ISET. The course will be launched shortly and be taught in the third year of the BA program for the duration of one academic semester.

To learn more about the circular economy concept, GEORGIA TODAY spoke with economist Dr. Hans Wiesmeth, a professor at the Technical University of Dresden, who helped develop the curriculum for the “Circular Economy” course at ISET, the Executive Director of CENN, Nana Janashia, and the Director of ISET, Dr. Tamar Sulukhia.

What is the circular economy and how does it differ from the linear economy?

Hans: The Ellen MacArthur Foundation provides one of the most prominent definitions of a circular economy: “A circular economy is an industrial system that is restorative or regenerative by intention and design. It replaces the ‘end-of-life’ concept with restoration, shifts towards the use of renewable energy, eliminates the use of toxic chemicals, which impair reuse, and aims for the elimination of waste through the superior design of materials, products, systems, and, within this, business models”. In particular, a circular economy aims to prevent waste, as “products are designed and optimized for a cycle of disassembly and reuse”. Consequently – and very importantly – a circular economy requires a “new thinking” in all parts of a society.

This is in contrast to the traditional linear economy, which is characterized as a “throughput economy”, a take, make and dispose economy based on the use of fossil fuels.

Why is the circular economy concept important?

Hans: Because of the gradually changing framework conditions for our economic and social systems, it’s becoming increasingly important to switch from a linear economy to a circular one. Otherwise, we risk depleting life supporting environmental resources with possibly disastrous consequences for the life of many people on earth.

WHAT WAS YOUR ROLE WORKING IN GEORGIA WITH CENN AND ISET?

Hans: I have been teaching “Environmental Economics and Policy” at ISET since 2008. I am happy that I got in contact with CENN in recent years. CENN provided support for discussing issues in waste management with important people from the public administration of Georgia, in particular the Ministry for the Environment. Moreover, I was able to develop a textbook on the circular economy to be used for teaching this important field in Georgian universities. Consequently, both institutions are very helpful for disseminating the concept of a circular economy in the countries of the South Caucasus.

Why and how did ISET become interested in the circular economy concept?

Tamar: With the high pace of urbanization and economic growth, the environmental footprint of Georgia’s economy is expanding and deepening. The need for action is evident and is further exacerbated by the impacts of climate change globally and locally. Many governments across the globe, including in Georgia, are increasingly realizing the need for proactive policies to green the economy and deal with severe impacts of climate change through mainstreaming adaptation and mitigation agenda in their national policies. Joint actions by policy-makers, business, civil society and citizens are required to soften the environmental footprint and use every opportunity towards efficient use of the country’s (and global) resources. Equipping the next generation of young professionals and future policy-makers with the right knowledge and skillset is an important part of this critical global and national agenda.

ISET has had integrated Environmental Economics in its Masters in Economics program curriculum since 2009 and it is taught by the visiting professor from Technical University Dresden (Germany) Dr. Hans Wiesmeth. A number of ISET alumni who have taken the course are employed by the Ministry of Environment and Agriculture, other public institutions and NGOs involved in design and implementation of environmental policies.

In 2017, USAID Waste Management Technologies in the Regions (WMTR) Project implemented by CENN hired Professor Wiesmeth to assist the Government of Georgia in designing and implementing the policy on extended producer responsibility (EPR). Professor Wiesmeth was closely collaborating with ISET Policy Institute researchers in delivering on this important task. This created a fruitful partnership and strong bonds between ISET and CENN. Through close collaboration and synergies with CENN on the circularity in the economics of environmental resources, CENN and ISET recently agreed to work with professor Wiesmeth further in expanding learning opportunities and strengthening skillsets for future economists in Georgia and beyond.

What purpose does the course serve? What kind of qualifications or professional directions can this lead the students to?

Tamar: The aim of the course is to teach students how to use tools of economic theory to analyze the use of environmental resources from the viewpoint of efficiency and sustainability. Studying the use of environmental resources across the value chain of production helps to better understand how to reduce (R) the environmental footprint, reuse (R) the resources already utilized for production and recycle (R) the products that can create precious resources. This summarizes the principle of the three Rs, that are the cornerstone of the circular economy. The course will equip students interested in environmental policy with knowledge of economic instruments for resource management and help them more easily identify costs and benefits associated with decisions. These skills are currently lacking both in Georgian public service and among civil society organizations, thus this knowledge will equip students with very much needed skills for interesting and highly impactful job opportunities. For more entrepreneurially-minded students, the course will go through the value chain of different resource uses and help them identify possible business opportunities that can arise from the approach of environmental protection.

How are you working with the education sector to promulgate the concept of ‘circular economy’?

Nana: We realized that in Georgia, there was a substantial deficit in specialization and professional workforce in circular economy, whether in practice or theory. For us, the most important goal is to make sure we can establish a system that doesn’t compromise the environment and our health, and above all, that can be sustained. Therefore, investing in education and creating a platform to support professions and workforce development was absolutely essential.

We decided to start working with educational institutions and support them in introducing a circular economy course into their curricula. We are working with the education sector intensively via various thematic seminars, trainings, competitions, camps, etc.

CENN, through its USAID WMTR II program, decided to take advantage of the country’s willingness to introduce circular economy approaches. It is essential to have specialists with a sufficient background in circular economy that can support the country in transitioning from a linear economy to a circular. These experts will provide their knowledge and support at the decision-making level as well as at the implementation level.

How was the syllabus developed?

Nana: We decided to introduce a circular economy course in the curricula of educational institutions and involve international expertise in this process. The USAID WMTR II program involved an international expert from Dresden University to develop syllabus along with relevant textbooks on the circular economy concept and, in addition, to conduct a training for the university lecturers. In March 2019, an intensive training was conducted on this topic and shortly afterwards the USAID WMTR II program worked intensively with ISET to support them in incorporating the circular economy course into their curriculum. We are very happy that this cooperation was possible and starting September 2019, ISET will offer this new course to its students. With the support of USAID WMTR II program, Hans Wiesmeth will be teaching the course during its first phase.",Georgia,2019.06
110,EU and ASEAN commit towards a circular economy for plastics in the ASEAN Region,"Kuala Lumpur, 12 June 2019: The two-day EU-ASEAN regional workshop on circular economy took place in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from 11 to 12 June 2019. The workshop, conducted back- to-back with the European Commission DG Environment Circular Economy Mission to Malaysia, emphasised the importance of collaboration between the EU and ASEAN towards a circular economy, and contributed to the EU-ASEAN High-Level Dialogue on Environment and Climate Change. Joint Opening Remarks of the EU-Malaysia Conference on circular economy and the EU-ASEAN regional workshop on circular economy were delivered by Mr. Daniel Calleja Crespo, European Commission Director-General for Environment, and Minister YB Yeo Bee Yin for Energy, Science, Technology, Environment, and Climate Change, Malaysia. The workshop served as an opportunity for the EU and ASEAN to reaffirm their commitment to strengthen cooperation on regional and global environmental challenges.

“Circular economy is not just another environment policy, it is not just another climate policy, and it is not another trade policy either. It’s all that and more – a truly cross-sectoral effort, built around people’s needs, and built together with industries and companies like you.” said Director-General for Environment, Daniel Calleja Crespo.

Minister YB Yeo Bee Yin underlined that “it is important whenever we talk about circular economy, we cannot put the system boundary to the national level – it is the global circular economy to be taken into account, and concrete global actions need to be undertaken.” Addressing the public and private sector, she added, “While governments need to provide incentives and support ‘replacement’ as 4th R (reduce, reuse, recycle, replace), it is up to the private sector to introduce innovative solutions, or otherwise facing the consequence of being left behind.”

Plastic, identified as a key priority in the European Commission Action Plan on Circular Economy, if facilitated and driven by enabling policy frameworks, has the potential to bring new opportunities for innovation, boost countries’ competitiveness, and create new jobs. A world-wide problem, waste and pollution harm ecosystems and fisheries, fill up landfills, clog urban water systems, contribute to global warming, and have negative impacts on human health. As a hotspot for these issues, Southeast Asia’s contribution to plastic pollution of the oceans over the last years has steadily increased. Tackling the problem by addressing changes in policy and legislation on plastics are seen as the most efficient ways to bring solutions. With a longstanding experience on waste management and circular economy, in its recently adopted Plastics Strategy, the European Union has committed to assist other regions in shifting towards a circular economy for plastics. Both regions, ASEAN and the EU, have jointly agreed to collaborate in tackling these issues and bringing solution to the problems.

Under this collaboration framework, the EU and ASEAN Secretariat launched a regional gap-analysis on the state of circular economy for plastics in ASEAN Member States. The analysis, conducted by a team of experts from the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) with support from the EU, developed a knowledge base for follow-up actions by the EU to inspire and assist circular economy approaches to plastic issues in the ASEAN region. The importance of facilitating the negotiation of a regional framework agreement and the development of regional circular economy guidelines for plastic pollution, followed by the support to develop technical standards for plastics, recycled plastics, and products made of plastics, were among the main findings presented during this two-day workshop. Overall the findings highlighted the main conclusions from all ten ASEAN Member States, while presenting the EU policy and legislation related to plastics, plastic waste and its promotion of use, and plastic waste regulations. With high participation from EU and ASEAN public and private sector, as well as civil society organisations, the workshop created opportunities for multi-stakeholder engagement in plastic waste management and minimisation, while providing room for discussion on what shall be achieved at the regional level.

Forward looking, the sectoral dialogue on circular economy with ASEAN will be further enhanced through sharing of EU experiences on waste, circular economy and plastic strategy in alignment with the upcoming Partnership Instrument project on marine litter, and in advising interested ASEAN Member States on changes in policy and legislation on plastics, plastic waste and single use plastics.

The workshop was supported by the Enhanced Regional EU-ASEAN Dialogue Instrument (E-READI), a development cooperation program that facilitates dialogues between the EU and ASEAN in priority policy areas of joint interest. Drawing on the EU’s experience of regional integration, the E-READI policy dialogue facility further strengthens both the ASEAN regional integration process as well as the overall ASEAN-EU partnership.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was established on 8 August 1967. The Member States of the Association are Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam. On 31 December 2015, the ASEAN Community was formally established. The ASEAN Secretariat is based in Jakarta.

227,How the circular economy can help save the planet – and the UAE,"A person buys a bottle of water, drinks it and throws the plastic away.

The bottle will take hundreds of years to degrade, polluting the earth, endangering our health and imperiling wildlife.

But what if there was another way? A path that cut single-use plastics, ended mindless consumption and tackled climate change. Enter the circular economy – a fresh way of thinking that promotes reuse, repair and recycling and even creates jobs. A World Economic Forum report from a few years ago even claimed it could generate 100,000 new jobs within five years.

Lofty goals, then. But the circular economy is centre stage at the moment in Finland. The three-day World Circular Economy Forum has brought together more than 2,000 green thinkers from across the globe.

“We are trying to change society,” said Hannele Pokka from the Finnish Ministry of Environment. “In the circular economy nothing is wasted. But to do this many things must change.”

The choice of Finland as hosts is no accident. It was the Finns who in 2016 published the world’s first national road map to a circular economy. Take the country’s forestry industry – a crucial sector employing tens of thousands of people. Effluent from its many paper mills once polluted Finland’s lakes, but now practically everything is reused.

Pine oil, once a wasted by-product, is now repurposed to make biofuel. Authorities have also managed to cut the 1,500 landfill sites the country had a few years ago to a few dozen through recycling and incinerating waste to generate power.

“Landfill as a term is going out of fashion,” said Ms Pokka. “We won’t need landfills at all within a few years.”

But it is not all rosy – Finland uses a lot of coal for heating. And individual households have much more to do to increase rates of recycling.

These challenges are relevant closer to home and efforts in the UAE to promote the circular economy are increasing. The UAE in April signed up to the World Economic Forum in the Middle East and North Africa’s Scale 360 initiative, which aims to shift countries towards a circular economy.

“We seek to promote Scale 360 … to ensure the conservation of resources, greater reliance on clean energy, the application of sustainable development standards and to create future opportunities for the youth,” said Thani Al Zeyoudi, Minister of Climate Change and Environment.

Just last year Abu Dhabi Municipality installed dedicated recycling depots across the city, while consumers are demanding more from business. Some hotels have now banned single use plastics, while a number of shops are encouraging customers to use refill stations for goods such as olive oil and pasta.

Bee’ah, the environmental management company based in Sharjah, has also been advocating the circular economy for some time. Writing in The National last year, its chief executive Khaled Al Huraimel said waste needed to be diverted from landfill and recycled. He also called for public awareness campaigns and more renewable energy.

“Our experience suggests that a willingness to adopt more sustainable ways of living already exists within the general population,” said Mr Al Huraimel. “It is therefore up to us and others in a similar position to harness and nurture that desire to do what is right for the environment, and ensure we convert it into positive action.”

Only a few months ago, it was suggested that GCC cities could save $138 billion (Dh507 billion) and 148 million tonnes of C02 emissions between 2020 and 2030 through the circular economy.

Many countries, then, have only just started on the path to a circular economy but the philosophy of reduce, reuse and recycle is a hard one to argue with.

“We have a lot to do,” said Ms Pokka. “But we are optimistic we can do it.”",United Arab Emirates,2019.06
296,Avery Dennison joins circular economy network as it ramps up sustainability focus,"Avery Dennison has joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Circular Economy 100 network as part of the company’s support of a global transition to a circular economy.

The move to join the network is part of the global labelling and packaging materials manufacturer’s ongoing practice of joining forces with customers and suppliers across the supply chain to deliver solutions that can make a material difference in the world.

The company believes that meeting evolving social and environmental needs and new business challenges can best be achieved by supporting a transition to a circular economy.

The company’s vice president and general manager of sustainability, Deon Stander, said: “Our size, scale, and position within the supply chain, give us a particular responsibility to aggressively act on the key principles of a circular economy–design out waste and pollution, keep products and materials in use, and regenerate natural systems.

“In eight decades of global manufacturing leadership, we’ve learned the importance of reinventing and improving the materials and products we make, as well as how we make them. With the circular economy as a clear orientation point, we are moving our sustainability efforts, and our business, forward and fostering bold solutions to address the sustainability challenges of our time.”

Avery Dennison’s circular practices and commitments include: inventing materials that improve the recyclability of consumer goods; increasing the amount of recycled content it uses in products; and building a global system for recycling used labelling and packaging materials.

407,Environmental and economic implications of recovering resources from food waste in a circular economy,"Around a third of food is wasted globally, requiring significant resources for its treatment and disposal, in addition to wasting valuable resources. Following the circular economy principles, this waste should ideally be avoided, and if not possible, treated to recover resources. This paper considers the life cycle environmental and economic implications of recovering energy and material resources from food waste, focusing on the UK situation. Four treatment methods are considered: anaerobic digestion, in-vessel composting, incineration and landfilling. The results show that per tonne of waste treated, anaerobic digestion has the lowest environmental impacts in 13 out of the 19 categories considered in the study, including net-negative global warming potential. In-vessel composting is the least sustainable option environmentally, in contrast to being preferred over incineration according to the circular economy principles. Incineration has the lowest life cycle costs (£71/t), while landfilling is the costliest option (£123/t). Managing the 4.9 Mt of food waste collected annually from UK households via the four methods generates 340,000 t CO eq. and costs £452 m, in addition to causing a number of other environmental impacts. However, it also saves 1.9 PJ of primary energy, primarily due to electricity generation through incineration. If all of this food waste was incinerated, £103 m and 360,000 t CO eq./year could be saved compared to current waste management, rendering incineration a carbon-negative technology. This would also result in savings in 14 other impacts, but would increase summer smog by 30% and metal depletion by 56%. The environmental benefits of incineration would be exceeded only if all food waste was treated by anaerobic digestion, which would save 490,000 t CO eq./year and produce 50% more electricity per tonne of waste than incineration. Anaerobic digestion would also lead to savings in 14 other impacts compared to the present situation, but would result in a four times higher acidification and three times greater emissions of particulate matter. In addition, it would save £251 m/year compared to the current costs. Nevertheless, prevention of avoidable food waste would realise far greater environmental and economic savings, estimated here at 14 Mt CO eq. and £10.7 bn annually.",N/A,2019.07
435,"Let's make it circular: waste, recycling and the circular economy | Department of Materials Science & Metallurgy","Professor James Elliott, Deputy Head of the Department of Materials Science and Fitzwilliam College Fellow, will be speaking about plastic use at the Let's make it circular: waste, recycling and the circular economy family event at Storey's Field Centre, in Eddington, this weekend.

James is part of the Cambridge Creative Circular Plastics Centre, within which his current research seeks to develop plastics that are either recyclable or which degrade in the environment. His team are rediscovering the natural polymers and focusing much more on issues like waste disposal and degradability, rather than prioritising durability and cost, which led to the development of synthetic polymers in the past. James hopes the work of the Cambridge Creative Circular Plastics Centre will be a catalyst for change and will engage companies across a number of sectors, including plastics manufacturers and waste management companies.

488,Ultimate goal is to develop zero waste circular economy: PM aide,"ISLAMABAD: Adviser to the Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam said on Monday Pakistan’s ultimate goal is to develop zero waste circular economy under the vision of Prime Minister Imran Khan.

He said this during a meeting with Finland’s Ambassador to South Asia, H.E. HarriKamarainen.

The Finnish ambassador called on the PM’s aide at his office and offered a vast spectrum of cooperation in the fields of the circular economy, solid and liquid waste management, afforestation, climate change, and green economy.

The envoy said Finland was greatly impressed by Pakistan’s efforts with climate change and Prime Minister of Pakistan’s global vision of cutting greenhouse gases. He informed that Finland’s current government was very enthusiastic about climate change and leading the agenda with the whole European Union.

Finland had performed a marvelous job in protecting the forest cover and their sustainable use by developing technology and innovation, he added.

The envoy said the country also introduced shopping bags made of peptic fiber to replace conventional plastic bags, which were widely being used in Finland.

He apprised the adviser about new technologies and advancement in the field of environment in the form of environmentally sustainable products like cotton and construction material made out of cellulose.

Amin Aslam admired Finland’s achievements in this regard and showed his keenness to learn from the Finnish model by cooperation.

He said in the first phase Pakistan wanted Islamabad to go waste-free by developing a circular economy.

Furthermore, a Finnish company was already interested in this project. Pakistan was the only developing country which was heavily investing in afforestation and that Pakistan would plant 10 Billion Trees with a cost of $1Billion.

He apprised the envoy of how Pakistan had established an Ecosystem Restoration Fund and other friendly countries were keen to invest in that fund.

He said that Pakistan had set a target of bringing up to 30% electric vehicles by 2030 and that EV policy was on cards.",Tuvalu,2019.07

598,UAE leading transformation of the global manufacturing sectors: Badr Al-Olama,"ABU DHABI, 6th July, 2019 (WAM) -- The UAE has a position as the global capital for the 4th Industrial Revolution, 4IR, and is leading the world charge to crystallise a future strategy for manufacturing and industrialisation, said Badr Al-Olama, Head of the Organising Committee for the Global Manufacturing and Industrialisation Summit, GMIS, 2019.

''The UAE is encouraging international efforts towards an industrial transformational approach that caters to demands of the global economy and future generations. Given its strategic location, the UAE has become the first choice for global industrialists,'' he said in a statement to the Emirates News Agency, WAM, ahead of the launch of the 2nd GMIS in Russia.

''Taking place from 9th to 11th July, 2019, in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg, the GMIS 2019 will gather more than 2000 thought leaders from the global manufacturing community with leaders of civil society to engage in debates across over 40 sessions focusing on critical topics, including sustainability in manufacturing, circular economy, food security, future-cities, cybersecurity, the evolution of 3D printing, healthcare, auto, the future of work, and industrial policy and their role in achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,'' he added.

The Global Manufacturing and Industrialisation Summit was established in 2015 to build bridges between manufacturers, governments and NGOs, technologists, and investors in harnessing the Fourth Industrial Revolution’s transformation of manufacturing, to enable the regeneration of the global economy.

''As co-chair of the GMIS, the United Arab Emirates and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, UNIDO, have made significant progress towards that end and increased the world’s attention to the event, especially those who have shared commitment with the UAE towards the modernisation of the sector,'' he said.

According to Badr Al-Olama, the GMIS has expanded its network of partnerships to 33 major world companies such as Mubadal Investment Co., Siemens, GE, IBM, Tawazun Holding L.L.C., Honeywell and PwC as well as 22 international industrial organisations.

On the contribution of the industrial sector to build a UAE sustainable, diversified economy, Badr Al-Olama said, ""The vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, for the post-oil era provides a key driving force to build advanced industrial capabilities and increase the country's competitiveness edge globally under the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030.""

The UAE Government, he added, launched the ""UAE Strategy for Artificial Intelligence"" to mark the post-mobile government phase which will rely on various future services, sectors and infrastructure projects. The strategy is first of its kind in the region and the world and it aims to: make the UAE the first in the field of AI investments in various sectors; achieve the objectives of UAE Centennial 2071; boost government performance at all levels; use an integrated smart digital system that can overcome challenges and provide quick efficient solutions and create new vital market with high economic value.

He also referred to the Mohammed bin Rashid Initiative for Global Prosperity, which he said, will unite the world’s leading manufacturers, start-ups and entrepreneurs, governments, United Nations agencies and philanthropists, academia and researchers, to form a community dedicated to spreading global prosperity through the art of ""making"".

A joint initiative of the United Arab Emirates and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, the Global Manufacturing and Industrialisation Summit is the world’s first cross-industry and cross-functional platform that unites manufacturers, governments and non-governmental organisations,NGOs, technologists, and investors to build a roadmap towards investing in capabilities, fostering innovation and developing the skills needed to position the manufacturing sector at the forefront of global economic growth and a key driver to advance the 17 SDGs.

Under the theme of ''Nature-Inspired Technology and the Future of Manufacturing'', GMIS 2019 will highlight some of the greatest innovations in biomimicry through dedicated sessions that explore the many ways manufacturing can draw inspiration from existing systems in the natural world to solve complex human problems.

The first edition of the Global Manufacturing and Industrialisation Summit was held at the Paris Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi in March 2017. It brought together over 3,000 leaders from government, business, and civil society from over 40 countries to advance manufacturing and industrial development globally, and to identify key trends and opportunities across 6 themes.

First announced by President Vladimir Putin in May 2018, GMIS 2019 will be held under the theme of ‘nature-inspired technologies’ – also known as biomimetic design and biomimicry – which is the science of mapping design challenges to the natural world to find innovative solutions.

667,Hirdaramani Group to make eco-friendly jeans,"* Circular economy aims at eliminating waste and continual use of resources

* Fashion industry, the second largest polluter in the world

Over 400,000 redesigned jeans will be in the market by 2021 following the global acceptance of the Jeans redesign project which has been endorsed by over 16 global companies, Lead of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s ‘Make Fashion Circular’ initiative, Francois Souchet said at a workshop conducted by the Hirdaramani Group and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation for academics and students in the fashion industry last week.

Leading fashion brands and manufacturers are to transform the way they produce jeans, tackling waste, pollution and the use of harmful practices, in line with guidelines published by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

The Jeans Redesign guidelines set out minimum requirements on garment durability, material health, recyclability and traceability. Based on the principles of the circular economy, the guidelines will work to ensure jeans last longer, can be easily recycled and are made in a way that is good for the environment and the health of garment workers.

The Jean Redesign project created by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s make fashion circular initiative brought together over 40 denim experts from academia, brands, retailers, manufacturers, collectors, sorters and NGOs to develop the guidelines.

A circular economy referred to as ‘circularity’ is an economic system aimed at eliminating waste and continual use of resources. Circular systems employs recycling, reuse remanufacturing and refurbishment to create a closed system minimising the use of resource input and the creation of waste.

The fashion industry is the second largest polluter in the world after the oil industry. It is estimated that over 70 million trees are logged annually to manufacture fabrics such as rayon and viscose contributing to climate change. It is also said that over 70 percent of what is produced in the fashion industry ends up in landfills globally.

“Keeping products and material in use is core in Asia. Europe has lost out in making the most out of products and materials.

One third of soil in the world has been destroyed and only around 50 percent of topsoil is left for cultivation. All products made of biological material must be safely released to the environment,” Souchet said.

Hirdaramani, a pioneer in the industry through its collaboration with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation joined a list of global industry stakeholders, corporations, NGOs and fashion houses such as Burberry, NIKE, PVH and Stella McCartney who have pledged to incorporate circularity into the core of their business.

Hirdaramani Group Director Nikhil Hirdaramani said the company is delighted to welcome the team from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to Sri Lanka and added that the Group is optimistic that participation in the Jeans Redesign project will positively impact all industry stakeholders in the journey toward a circular economy.

“We are conscious of our position as one of the largest global manufacturers of jeans. The Group has signed up as one of the 16 global drivers of the Jeans Redesign project,” Hirdaramani said.

The Group has made considerable progress in the sustainable manufacturing space. In its washing plants the company has reduced water use drastically by employing low liquor ratio washing machines and waterless washing through ozone technology.

The company has placed emphasis on using only green screen chemicals in the manufacturing process and meeting ZDHC standards.

Across the Group, there is a strong focus on reducing waste to landfills and currently waste reduction is around 70 percent.

The Group which reached a net zero status in emission from energy, plans to set up a ‘Discovery Lab’ for product innovation and technology, where future leaders would get an opportunity to interact with experts in the global apparel industry.",Sri Lanka,2019.08
709,International conference “Circular Economy in the Nordic-Baltic Region: How far have we come?”,"The international conference “Circular Economy in the Nordic-Baltic Region: How far have we come?” took place in Riga on September 10 and was organised by Latvian Environmental Investment Fund, NGO Green Liberty, Nordic Council of Ministers Office in Latvia and Embassy of the Netherlands to Latvia.

The purpose of the event was to continue the dialogue about progress towards a circular economy in public and private sectors among the main stakeholders - consumers, suppliers, policymakers and legislators, as well as academic and nongovernmental experts and media.

The role of local governments is to promote and implement a circular economy through innovative procurements, while the role of entrepreneurs is to develop smart and sustainable business models, products and services.

It is clear that the linear model of economic growth we relied on in the past is no longer suited for the needs of today's modern societies in a globalised world. where we take natural resources, make products and - after a brief period of time - discard them as waste. This inefficient modus operandi depletes natural resources, requires large quantities of energy, creates waste and is not sustainable.

The circular economy offers an alternative model where products are not discarded as waste after they stop being used, they preserve as much value as possible for as long as possible - by prolonging working life, sharing, repairing, reusing, recycling and using them as raw materials for the production of new products. This approach reduces waste, energy consumption, saves natural resources, creates new jobs and is more cost-effective.

967,"SIRC plans to build recycling, sorting facilities in Riyadh","RIYADH — Saudi Investment Recycling Company (SIRC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Public Investment Fund (PIF), is planning to build recycling and sorting facilities in Riyadh, as part of the government’s initiative to implement a circular economy model in the Kingdom.



In an interview with Saudi Gazette, Jeroen Vincent, CEO of SIRC, said the company will kick off its plan in the fourth quarter of 2019 in the capital by building a recycling plant.



He recalled that the facility will convert construction and demolition waste into construction aggregates for road backfill and concrete applications for a residential project housing 35,000 units.



Excerpts from the interview follow:



Q: What is the prime reason for SIRC signing the MoU with Riyadh Municipality?



A: The memorandum of understanding (MoU) between SIRC, the National Waste Management Center and the Riyadh Municipality aims to start recycling activities in Riyadh as part of the overall waste management strategy to achieve the national recycling targets.



SIRC role is to develop the waste management sector and in this MOU particular the recycling capacity in Riyadh. The prerequisite for an a efficient recycling infrastructure is the existence of source segregation. As Riyadh is the first Amanah that started the roll out of source segregation with a 2 bin door-to-door system it was for SIRC the preferred city to start with building recycling facilities.



As part of an integrated waste management system, the SIRC will build state-of-the-art recycling facilities to recycle all types of waste in the capital. This will include recycling of municipal waste into recyclables such as fertilizer, paper, plastics, and metals.



The first initiative will be the recycling of construction and demolition waste into building materials for road construction and housing projects. This will be followed by the construction of a sorting facility for solid municipal waste, which is a result of the Riyadh Municipality’s program to introduce sorting at source by supplying each household with two binds, one for food waste (organic) and one for all other types of wastes. This program, under the name “City without Containers”, is an important step towards a clean and environmentally-friendly city, but will also unlock a large volume of materials for the paper, plastic and metals industry.



Q: How is SIRC working on implementing the strategy for the waste management sector in the Kingdom?



A: Saudi Arabia has been witnessing rapid industrialization, high population growth rate and fast urbanization that have resulted in increased levels of pollution and waste. Waste management is becoming a big challenge for the government and local bodies with each passing day. A sustainable economy can’t live without an efficient ecology system.



Responding to this growing issue, the Public Investment Fund (PIF) established the Saudi Investment Recycling Co. (SIRC) in 2017 as part of their sector development strategy next to the sector initiatives of developing the local defense industry (SAMI) and the entertainment industry (Seven).



As sector development initiative SIRC will invest, develop, own, and operate in various activities across all waste management in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, including cutting-edge treatment and recycling facilities, and waste-to-energy solutions that will support the National Renewable Energy Program. As part of our business strategy, we signed the MOU with Riyadh to start executing our mnunicipal waste strategy and with our first major investment in GEMS we all ready have an excellent platform to serve the industry with recycling of complex waste streams from oil, petrochemical and mining industries.



Our portfolio company Gems is a good example of our local capabilities. As market leader in the middle east in the industrial waste sector Gems all ready developed cutting edge recycling technology. This technology is developed in the Kingdom, in parallel of expanding capacity locally we will export this technology as there is a lot of interest globally in our capabilities.



Additionally, SIRC will act as the national champion in the waste management sector by creating a range of opportunities for private sector participation, investing in companies and identifying opportunities to invest with the aim to accelerate the growth and the development of the sector..



SIRC aims to contribute over SR 37 billion ($10 billion) to the gross domestic product, attracting up to SR 6 billion in inward investments and creating around 23,000 new jobs by 2030.



SIRC is the first organization of its kind in the Kingdom and will be a key driver of the circular economy. We have already set highly ambitious targets of achieving 81 per cent overall recycling compared to the best achievers globally such as the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany, who range between 54 and 68 per cent.



To be able to reach our targets and to create the basis for private sector investments we need a proper legislation and enforcement. The main success factor for achieving the high recycling goals in the western European countries was the legislation, enforcement and awareness programs by the governments.



With recent inception of the National Waste Management Center and the development of the national regulatory framework the Kingdom started to define the future goals and established a new regulator for the sector. This is a great step forwards as it is the acknowledgement of the existance of the sector in Saudi Arabia. Soon we will see the implementation of a new legislation and the establishment of the environmental police by the ministry of interior. All the ingredients for a sustainable waste management industry.



Having a first-class recycling ecosystem will have environmental, social, and economic benefits for the Kingdom.



Q: What amount of solid waste is generated in Riyadh? How is it being disposed of currently?



A: The city of Riyadh annually produces 3.4 million tons of solid household waste and 8 million tons of construction and demolition waste.



Though waste is collected from individual or community bins and dispose of in landfills or dumpsites, the Saudi waste management system is characterized by a lack of waste disposal facilities and absence of tipping fees. Most of the landfills are expected to reach their capacities within the next 10 years. We need to discourage landfill by higher tipping fees and we need to encourage the further implementation of the dual-bin system for household waste, so we will be able to sort our waste in mechanically sorting facilities and convert our food- and green waste into compost which is a natural fertilizer..



There is a great importance in sorting our foodwaste from all the other types of waste, it creates greenhouse gasses on the landfill and it is downgrades paper and plastic quality in a way that the recycling of it is almost impossible. People always think about paper, plastic and metals if we speak about recycling, with the fact that foodwaste is 57% of our total municipal waste bin it is evident to start segregating it. We shouldn’t throw it on a landfill if we are able to convert it in fertile soil!



To strengthen the recycling concept in Riyadh, more education and awareness campaigns need to take place. People need to get involved and feel like they are making a difference in protecting their environment. Each school should have recycling ambassadors, and incentives should be created for recycling. People also need to understand how waste is currently being disposed of. The private and government sectors, along with the citizens, should work together to solve the waste problem.



Q: What new projects are you planning with the Riyadh Municipality? What is your investment outlay for these projects?



A: SIRC will jointly work with the National Waste Management Center and the Riyadh Municipality on the execution of the overall waste management strategy to achieve a set of strategic objectives for recycling by 2035. This notably includes the recycling of 81 per cent of the 3.4 million tons of annual production volume of municipal solid waste and 47 per cent of the 8 million tons of production volume of construction and demolition waste per year.



Our first project will start in Q4 this year. It will be a recycling facility on a large construction site where 35,000 houses will be build. Instead of using crushed virgin rocks we will recycle the construction and demolition waste that is currently sitting in the city to aggregates that can be used for road back fill and concrete applications, A perfect circular economy example where we reuse our construction waste into new construction materials. This option is more economical then using virgin materials, it cleans up the city and reduces heavy traffic in the city.



In 2020 we are planning to build a high volume materials sorting facility where we automatically can sort the waste from the waste that is segregated from food waste. Followed by an investment in compost facilities where we will treat our food- and green wastes.



Q: Reports suggest that there is a lack of waste disposal facilities and waste is disposed of in landfills or dumpsites across Saudi Arabia. How are you looking to deal with this issue? Is it the biggest challenge for you right now in Riyadh?



A: Main landfill is Sulay which has in the current operated cells proper engineering. The closed cells are now equipped with gas capturing systems.



The remaining landfill capacity is limited so therefore important that we start diverting our waste from it.



The biggest challenge is to get the source segregation rolled out in the city. People should take their bins into their premises and only put them outside when the collection will take place. Furthermore is it from great importance to have effective awareness campaigns that will show people how to segregate waste and the use of the 2 bins. A proper segregation is the basis for a successful recycling result.



SIRC will support Amanat Alriyadh in their project “A neighborhood without containers”, which intends to introduce the dual bin system for household waste within the jurisdiction of Riyadh Municipality. The move comes after a successful pilot in Alrawdah and Alwaha districts where households separated their organic waste (food, green clippings) in one bin, and all other kinds of wastes (including recyclables) in the other bin.



SIRC will also collaborate with Amanat Alriyadh to divert organic waste from landfills, which will significantly improve air quality, and convert waste into compost to be used within the city.



SIRC will also be using state-of-the-art technologies to sort out recyclables from the second bin. These recyclables, which would otherwise be landfilled, will now help local businesses tap into new supplies of raw materials such as paper, plastic, and metals.



Furthermore, SIRC and Amanat Alriyadh will jointly start treatment of construction and demolition waste. One of the activities among many will be to clean up the streets of such solid waste and use it as feedstock for numerous under-construction projects in Riyadh.



Q: Waste sorting and recycling are driven by an active informal sector. How do you look to resolve this issue with the Riyadh Municipality?



A: SIRC would develop and operate projects to increase landfill diversion rates and boost recycling figures in the Kingdom. The country currently recycles around 10 per cent of the 50 million tons of recyclable waste it produces, with 90 percent diverted to landfills, preliminary studies by the PIF have found.



With the new investments in source segregation and recycling facilities we are moving away from using our cheaper option of landfill. These new investments need to be financed out of the recyclable revenues and by government funds. Therefor the waste, including the recyclables, collected by the private should end up by those new facilities so we can create value out of it.



In this new setup it is clear that there is no room for any informal sector to collect and sell recyclables as it will create a negative impact on our economy and at the end will lead to higher cost for the government and citizens.



Q: Dubai, Sharjah and Abu Dhabi have launched waste-to-energy plants. Are you planning any such plant in Riyadh?



A: The Saudi government wants to develop 3GW of waste-to-energy facilities by 2030, to manage its solid waste, contribute to its base load electricity and to diversify its energy. This development provides an excellent opportunity for the local and international companies in the cleantech and waste-management sector.



Waste to energy is the solution for waste that cannot be recycled, it is the alternative for landfill with the benefit that we can generate energy from the incineration process. Incinerating waste is still a less favorable option then recycling but will be needed in the future as last resort for certain waste streams. Compared to landfill it is a very expensive option, the price for incineration in approximately SR400 per ton almost 40 times more expensive than the current landfill price.



So our priority now is to divert waste from landfill and maximize recycling, landfill and incineration will only destroy are valuable materials and therefor should be minimized.



To get proper funding for waste to energy we need to implement tariff schemes, we expect that we will be ready for this as of 2023. — SG",Saudi Arabia,2019.08

45,Calculation and evaluation of circularity indicators for the built environment using the case studies of UMAR and Madaster,"Understanding buildings as material depots radically changes the way resources need to be managed within the construction industry and the built environment. Similar to warehousing, buildings, cities and regions will have to keep track and anticipate the stocks and flows of materials, needing to document and communicate (at the right moment) which materials in what quantities and qualities become available for re-use or recycling where and at what time in the future. This paper describes the process of documenting materials and products utilized in the construction of the Urban Mining and Recycling (UMAR) unit within the Madaster platform. UMAR is a fully circular residential unit of Empa NEST created from secondary resources and designed as a material depot for future constructions. Madaster is an online platform, which generates and registers materials passports and calculates a Circularity Indicator for their construction, use, and end-of-life phases. The results of the calculations show that the UMAR unit is 96% circular. Constructed from 95% non-virgin and rapidly renewable materials, the unit has a utility rate of 98% and 92% of its materials are prepared to return into pure-type material cycles at the unit’s end of life. In combination, these two case studies provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the capabilities of materials passports and the Madaster Circularity Indicator to document material stocks and flows within a circular built environment, and to assess the potential of circularity indicators as a design tool supporting the transition towards a circular construction industry. The continuous development of tools and systems for material cadastres undoubtedly represents a key prerequisite for the implementation of a paradigm shift towards a functioning circular construction industry.",N/A,2019.09
58,Transition to circular economy on firm level: Barrier identification and prioritization along the value chain,"This research paper is concerned with potential barriers to the transition to a circular economy business model (CEBM) on the firm-level. Using a case study in the electronics manufacturing industry, we identify and analyze barriers in terms of their impact along the value chain (VC) as well as the level of difficulty required to overcome them. This allows us to map barriers to managerial responsibilities, thus improving the organizational transition process. The key findings of this research are: (1) To scale up CEBM on the firm-level, additional changes need to be implemented next to the oft-cited and discussed changes towards a Product-Service-System (PSS) and reverse logistics. Based on literature research and our case study, we put forward an extensive list of 29 potential barriers. (2) As managerial and financial resources are limited, we also suggest a priority ranking for barriers. Specifically, we show that barriers should be prioritized along the dimensions of their organizational resistivity and their impact on the VC. Organizational resistivity refers to the estimated effort along managerial time, financial resources, and cultural resistance for change, while VC impact refers to the ability of the barrier to influence and re-direct product, parts, and material flows along the foreword and reverse supply chain. This type of barrier assessment is new to the literature. (3) We argue that the proposed method for barrier prioritization, which we term the Circular Economy Matrix, can be readily transferred to manufacturing firms in other industries. (4) Clustering the barriers along managerial responsibilities (sets of barriers) is shown to lead to a more efficient and effective transition, as gauged by incurred transaction costs.",N/A,2019.09
89,Circular economy model gradually becoming mainstream in Vietnam - VnExpress International,"The concept refers to an economic model aimed at eliminating waste and continual use of resources. It implies the creation of a closed system that reuses, shares, repairs, remakes and recycles, minimizing the use of resource inputs and the creation of waste, pollution and emissions.

The circular economy and green economy, important factors in sustainable development, featured prominently on the agenda at a recent national conference.

Vu Tien Loc, chairman of the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI), said sustainable development has become the mantra of the modern world and a foundation of the interaction between nations. It was a bridge linking humans with each other, and a passport to enter the global market, he said.

""Leaving a 'green footprint' on the global economic map is the trait of an ethical business. Free trade agreements such as CPTPP (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership) and EVFTA (EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement) are also designed based on this foundation.""

Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said at the conference he believed sustainable development was not only an urgent need but also an essential trend in social evolution. ""Essential means if you go against it, you will fail,"" the PM said.

Globally, leading corporations are gradually switching to a circular model. For instance, Swedish furniture company IKEA is committed to fully switching to the circular economy by 2030, while Lego aims to use vegan plastic and Carlsberg has improved its packaging to reduce the amount of plastic.

France’s Schneider Electric gets 12 percent of its revenues from the circular economy, and expects to save 100,000 tons of resources between 2018 and 2020, the conference heard.

With environmental concerns growing in the society, a switch to the circular economy model was prudent, said Do Thai Vuong, vice president of Unilever Vietnam.

Other speakers noted that in Vietnam, some banks and foreign companies were leading the way in embracing the green and circular economy models.

HDBank was mentioned as a typical provider of green credit in the country. Its lending to renewable energy projects has reached VND10 trillion ($430 million) this year and is expected to increase to VND16 trillion by 2020. As of August 31, its lending for solar energy projects was worth VND 9.8 trillion.

Le Ngoc Lam, deputy head of operations at the state-owned bank BIDV, proposed that the government initiates programs providing preferential credit for green projects, those that protect the environment and are energy efficient.

The central bank should direct banks on how to treat projects that adversely affect the environment, such as increasing loan interest rates, he said.

But a circular economy remains a new concept to Vietnamese enterprises, especially small and medium ones.

Nguyen Quang Vinh, general secretary of the VCCI and vice chairman of the VCCI's Sustainable Development Businesses Council, said this lack of familiarity not only risks causing a shortage of resources and price volatility, but would also affect a company's sustainable development.

PM Phuc said the government encourages adoption of the circular economy model in production and consumption to create a non-disposal economy model.

In 2016 the government had approved a national program on sustainable production and consumption but its impact has been limited.",Vietnam,2019.09
139,Russian regions learned about the achievements of Finland’s circular economy,"Moscow, September 20.

258,"Redefining growth, ‘Circular Economy’ gains traction globally | Daily FT","Neste Vice President and Research and Development Petri Lehmus with the visiting Asian journalists including Daily FT

By Charumini de Silva 



 in Helsinki, Finland



 Circular economy, which is essentially looking beyond the current ‘take-make-waste’ extractive industrial model and aims to redefine growth, focusing on positive society-wide benefits, is a new phenomenon that is gaining traction globally, with experts saying developing countries stand to benefit the most.

What is circular economy?



 Circular economy is the new paradigm for business, which aims for economic growth through new, sustainable business models. 



 It entails gradually decoupling economic activity from the consumption of finite resources and designing waste out of the system. Underpinned by a transition to renewable energy sources, the circular model builds economic, natural, and social capital. It is based on three principles, which includes design out waste and pollution, keep products and materials in use and regenerate natural systems. 



 Proponents of the circular economy suggest that a sustainable world does not mean a drop in the quality of life for consumers and can be achieved without loss of revenue or extra costs for manufacturers. The argument is that circular business models can be as profitable as linear models, allowing us to keep enjoying similar products and services.



 According to new Accenture research, the circular economy could generate $4.5 trillion worth of additional economic output by 2030. The research identifies circular business models that will help decouple economic growth from natural resource consumption, while driving greater competitiveness.



 The circular economy includes products, infrastructure, equipment and services, and applies to every industry sector. It includes ‘technical’ resources (metals, minerals, fossil resources) and ‘biological’ resources (food, fibres, timber).



 The circular economy can cover a broad scope; findings from the literature show that researchers have focused on different areas such as industrial applications with both product-oriented and services, practice and policies to better understand the limitations that the circular economy currently faces, strategic management for details of the circular economy and different outcomes such as potential re-use applications and waste management.



 Most schools of thought advocate a shift from fossil fuels to the use of renewable energy, and emphasise the role of diversity as a characteristic of resilient and sustainable systems. It includes discussion of the role of money and finance as part of the wider debate, and some of its pioneers have called for a revamp of economic performance measurement tools.



 One example of a circular economy model is the implementation of renting models in traditional ownership areas (e.g. electronics, clothes, furniture, and transportation). Through renting the same product to several clients, manufacturers can increase revenues per unit, thus decreasing the need to produce more to increase revenues. Recycling initiatives are often described as a circular economy and are likely to be the most widespread models.

Finland — great case study for circular economy



 Finland is a frontrunner in the field of circular economy as the country’s solution for a sustainable society with innovative solutions coming from extensive collaboration among public and private sectors. Finland has set a goal to be a circular economy leader by 2025. 



 For Finland, circular bioeconomy is a tool for achieving sustainable development, combatting climate change, saving natural resources, and improving the state of the environment. All while generating economic growth and jobs. According to estimates, the circular economy may contribute an annual added value of at least three billion euros to the Finnish economy by 2030. 



 Finland was also the first country in the world to release a national circular economy road map, outlining the way to sustainable well-being and successful carbon-neutral future. 



 The first World Circular Economy Forum (WCEF) was held in Helsinki in 2017. The ground-breaking event not only presented the world’s best circular economy solutions, but has also become an annual summit for the global circular economy community. In 2018 it was held in Yokohama, Japan.



 This year, the WCEF, where Daily FT was present along with select media from Asia, focused on a range of issues including: Acceleration of Circular Businesses and Investing in Circular Economy Businesses; The Circular Economy in Cities; Governance and Circular Economy Roadmaps; Plastics and a Circular Bioeconomy; The Circular Economy in Construction; Measuring Circularity and the Fair Use of Data; Education for the Circular Economy; The Circular Economy for Water; The Carbon-Neutral Industry in the Circular Economy; and Circularity in our Day-To-Day Lives.



 Finland is now carrying out practical circular economy experiments that are providing benefits across all sectors of business and society. Combining Finnish success in education and strong competences in digital solutions, Finland aims at offering unique solutions globally. 



 The United Nations environmental conference’s UNEA4 ministerial declaration in March emphasised the role of the circular economy as a tool for building sustainable consumption model and this is in part, is something WCEF responds to. The circular economy is also becoming a key topic for the G20 nations’ meetings held in Japan in June. The circular economy is now a core component both of the European Union’s 2050 Long-Term Strategy to achieve a climate-neutral Europe and of China’s five-year plans.

Sitra — A fund for the future



 Sitra, the Finnish Innovation Fund, was founded in 1967 as a part of the Bank of Finland, on the country’s 50th anniversary, has played a key role in establishing the circular economy concept in the country. It is an independent public foundation which operates directly under the supervision of the Finnish Parliament. Sitra functions both as a think tank and as an investment company.



 The Finnish Innovation Fund, Sitra’s operational independence has been further strengthened by its funding model. It is not answerable to the government in power and does not depend on the State budget; instead, its operations are funded with the profits of its endowment and the profits of its operations.



 According to law, the funds must be invested securely and in a profitable manner. The return from Sitra’s endowment averages at approximately Euro 30 million a year. Sitra invests in companies and startups to create new profitable business.



 Sitra was honoured as the world’s best public-sector actor in the circular economy in The Circulars Awards at the World Economic Forum in 2018 for its pioneering work to accelerate the world’s transition to a circular economy.



 “We aim to inspire and help people, companies and administrations to see the opportunities of the new low-carbon lifestyle and the business opportunities related to it. We work together to experiment and discover permanent, easy-to-use, intelligent and clean solutions,” Sitra Director Communication and Public Affairs Veera Heinonen told a group of journalists from Asia including Daily FT.



 According to Sitra, circular economy helps to redistribute global wealth equitably. In Finland, particularly in the public sector, many municipalities have taken voluntary, active steps towards a more sustainable future.

Champions of Finnish enterprises



 Among other organisations that are championing the circular economy in Finland includes both public and private institutions which include Environment Ministry, Helsinki Metropolitan Smart and Clean Foundation, Haaga-Helia, Smart and Clean, Helsinki Central Library Oodi, Sulapac, InfinitiedFiber, Amerplast and Neste. During the media study tour Daily FT witnessed how these companies strive towards circular economic sustainable future. 



 Haaga-Helia is the only university of applied sciences in Finland offering a minor study path in corporate responsibility. It is also signatory to the UN Principles for Responsible Management Education demonstrating its commitment to offering responsibility topics in business education. 



 “Circular economy has been a specific development area in the past two years during which Haaga-Helia has introduced a joint study path with two other metropolitan Universities of Applied Sciences on circular economy business models,” Haaga-Helia President and Adjunct Professor Dr. Teemu Kokko said. 



 Currently it is working together with 18 other Finnish Universities of Applied Sciences to introduce 235 credits worth of circular economy courses into joint offering by 2020. Circular economy is also a current topic in its corporate outreach and project work.



 Smart and Clean Foundation is a five-year ‘step-change’ project with 29 public and private partners from the Helsinki Metropolitan cities, businesses, universities, research institutions and State actors. 



 “Smart and Clean has an ambitious goal to develop accelerate and orchestrate concrete climate solutions that provide cities and urban citizens the opportunity to reduce their carbon footprint and to improve their quality of life,” Smart and Clean Executive Director Tiina Kaho said.



 The institution orchestrates multi-stakeholder ecosystems, which can lead the way in making the significant changes needed to improve the scale and speed of climate and circular solutions in areas such as housing and renovation, smart mobility solutions and the closed circle of plastics.



 One of the most fascinating concepts in Helsinki was its Central Library Oodi, which is a more than just a library. It is one of 37 branches of Helsinki City Library and part of the Helmet library network. The energy efficient library is an impressive calling card for Finnish architecture. 



 “Oodi functions as a living room for residents, located right at the heart of Helsinki. Its wide range of services and facilities has created new library landscape for Helsinki and Finland. The services are available to residents seven days a week, from early in the morning till late in the evening,” Helsinki City Library Director Katri Vanttienn said.



 Libraries’ duties in Finland are defined by the new Library Act which came into effect from 1 January 2017. The libraries help to promote and share knowledge through events such as providing access to materials, information and cultural contents, maintaining versatile and up-to-date collections, promoting reading and literature, providing information services, guidance and support in the acquisition and use of information and in versatile literacy skills, providing premises for learning, recreational activities, working, andcivic activities as well as promoting social and cultural dialogue.



 According to her as at end 2018 Finland has 854 public libraries with3,553 experts at service lending 34.5 million items ranging from 29 million books, 2.7 million audio records, 1.1 million movies and series, 62,000 magazines and periodicals, 87,000 e-books and 1.9 million new acquisitions. In 2018, over 50 million people have visited these libraries with 38 million has visited online. 



 Sulapac is a private company that has innovated a fully biodegradable and microplastic-free material which has the benefits of plastic without its waste problem. The firm has also introduced a patent-pending marine biodegradable straw made from sustainably sourced, renewable raw materials – wood and natural binders.



 “We are a company driven with a mission to save the world from plastic waste,” Sulpac Deputy CEO and Head of Marketing and Communications Antti Valtonen said.



 Infinited Fiber is another private company which is transforming waste into resources especially in the apparel sector to introduce sustainable fashion. 



 The company has created a technology that allows textile waste to be used over and over, preserving 100%. “The technology brings enormous social, environmental and economic impact to the textile value chain and everybody’s wardrobe,” Infinited Fiber CEO Petri Alava said.



 Amerplast is a flexible packaging company striving to grow together with its customers and to create a future of sustainable packaging and circular economy of plastics. “We believe what is good for the environment is good for business,” Amerplast Marketing and Communications Manager Laura Alisalo said. The company believes in continuing its journey of transforming the flexible packaging industry into an environmentally-sound business.



 Neste is the world’s largest producer of renewable diesel from waste and residue raw materials, introducing renewable solutions also to the aviation and plastic industries. “We are a company that creates sustainable solutions for transport, business and consumer needs,” Neste Vice President and Research and Development Petri Lehmus said. 



 Neste is the only company in the world to have already produced renewable fuels from over 10 different raw materials. In July 2018, the company announced it was exploring ways to introduce liquefied waste plastic as a future raw material for fuels, chemicals and new plastics. The firm has set a target to process over one million tons of waste plastic annually from 2030.



 Creating gourmet-level dishes from ‘waste to taste,’ Restaurant Loop became Finland’s first waste food restaurant. It is established by a non-profit association. “Our trucks pick up surplus food from supermarkets in the mornings and Loop’s team of chefs plans the day’s menu based on the available ingredients. The idea is to deliver high quality gourmet level meals which are also available for everyone,” Restaurant Loop Waste to Taste Managing Director Mirka Korkia-aho said. 



 The Waste to Taste team also get requests from farms to collect their excessive produce at a very low price or for free, without letting it go into waste. In addition to these companies which Daily FT was able to visit during the study tour, there are many world-class Finnish enterprises that have adopted circular economy approaches in their business already. Finland excels in various solutions from waste management and sustainable food to new material development. 



 During the study tour, journalists were also educated on how Finnish people sort their waste and recycle by visiting a home of a Finnish family. 



 In addition, a guided walk in the Nuuksio national park near Helsinki was also arranged to relax after and long day in the sauna Löyly including a dip in the lake.



 On the final day, the group experienced the clean nature and breathed the cleanest air in the world. It was reiterated that clean thinking runs in Finnish genes and sustainability is their second nature. The unique location shapes the way Finnish people think, work, and innovate, persistent long-term efforts, public and private sector collaboration, and cutting edge cleantech expertise were outlined as key factors to succeed in protecting nature.



 Canada will host World Circular Economy Forum 2020, where participants will learn how Canada’s unique circular solutions are making a global impact.

Lessons for Sri Lanka



 Although Western economies are in an advanced position, Sitra experts pointed out that developing countries were in a strong position to take advantage.



 Success now in embedding circular principles in industrial growth and infrastructural development strategies can help to ensure that the needs of growing and urbanising populations are met without risking rises in resource use, emissions and environmental pollution. For example, in adopting modular, adaptive and resilient design principles, the circular economy can help to deliver quality housing and infrastructure at low economic and environmental cost.



 “Developing countries are already global centres of production and are also set to become the global drivers of consumption. With enough investment and learnings from the other pioneering circular economies like Finland, developing countries can leapfrog developed countries in digital and material innovation to embed sustainable production and consumption at the heart of their economies,” they said. It was also revealed that countries like Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and Indonesia have started on this journey towards circular economy several years ago and are making a lot of progress. Thereby, a country like Sri Lanka can harness all these experiences, learnings and know-how and do it much better.



 However, this requires going beyond just classifying and sorting of garbage. The private sector needs to address this from production levels, similar to the practices adopted by most Finnish enterprises, and get public sector support as well. In addition, the academia and universities must also partner this dialogue, in designing policies and knowledge and skills development.",Sri Lanka,2019.09
276,What is a circular economy and how is Sharjah taking the lead?,"Last week, I watched with keen interest as the young environmental activist, Greta Thunberg, arrived in New York after sailing across the Atlantic in a zero-carbon yacht. The Swedish teenager, who has galvanised support among young people across the world, will attend a UN summit on zero emissions, where she will issue a call for world leaders to do more to tackle the great environmental challenges we face.

I applaud her message that the world needs to act right now to reduce carbon emissions before it is too late. But the reality is there are many challenges on the path to creating a sustainable economy. How do we use our resources in a smarter way? How do we ensure economic prosperity but also create a greener future for our children? We must address this issue from multiple angles.

The key to this sustainable future is the creation of a ‘circular economy’. By creating a resource loop where nothing goes to waste, we are extending the lifespan of resources and their economic value while sustaining growth by turning used resources into new income streams.

Apart from reducing the depletion of resources and generating revenue in new ways, a circular economy has a number of other benefits. It plays an essential role in meeting the urgent requirement of reducing our overall carbon footprint. It creates significant opportunities for investment, if we are early adopters and developers of revolutionary breakthroughs in sustainable innovation. It enables the creation of strategic partnerships between government and non-government entities to build sustainable alternatives to present forms of production and consumption. And it allows for the diversification of the economy and investment from foreign entities. This enhances our natural wealth and ensures social being, in addition to increasing jobs at all skill levels.

At Bee’ah, the UAE's leading integrated environmental, recycling and waste management company, our aim is to ensure a sustainable, technology-driven future through creative and resourceful solutions. This goal is in alignment with our governments in this region, who have the vision and foresight to address the need for a sustainable future. With the introduction of initiatives like the UAE Vision 2021, the UAE Green Agenda 2015-2030 and the UAE energy Strategy 2050, there have been great efforts towards implementing a green economy in the UAE. Beyond the UAE, we also have great admiration for Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 goals.

Bee-ah’s approach to a circular economy began in 2007 with the goal of implementing a zero-waste to landfill strategy. Since then, we have tripled the diversion rates in Sharjah and we have now achieved 76 per cent diversion, the highest in the Middle East. We are now leaders in waste management. Through our technological innovations, together with an eco-friendly fleet of 1,200 vehicles, we are serving iconic landmarks across the UAE like the Burj Khalifa. Using a digitilsation solution such as our Bee’ah Waste Management System built on the SAP Prologa platform, we have reduced the number of vehicles used and the number of waste collection trips, even while increasing tonnage. All these features, in turn, save time, effort, resources and manpower.

As the first fully integrated waste management company in the UAE, we undertake everything from collection to disposal. We collect around three million tonnes of waste annually. This waste is brought to our transfer station and sorted, before being sent to our recycling facilities for processing. Through these facilities, we convert end-of-life products into recycled raw materials and products such as rubber tiles and concrete aggregates.

These hi-tech processes not only re-use precious resources, but also create a diverse revenue generation model, which is improving the future resource security of our community.

The notion of a circular economy would be impossible without clean energy sources. This requires disruptive technologies and disruptive thinking. That is why we have partnered with Masdar to form the Emirates Waste to Energy Company, which will establish waste-to-energy facilities across Mena. We have already started work on the UAE’s first waste to energy plant which is being built within our waste management complex in Sharjah. This facility will process more than 300,000 tonnes of municipal solid waste each year, produce around 30 MW of energy, and it will be able to power up to 28,000 homes. This development will help us to achieve the Middle East’s first zero-waste solution in Sharjah by 2021.

Of course, creating a circular economy also requires us to think deeply about how we integrate new technologies into our daily lives. Last year, we launched the region's first sustainable transport company, ION, in partnership with Crescent Enterprises, to help foster radical transport solutions for the future and reduce air pollution for the benefit of all citizens. ION sources electric vehicles and integrates them into existing infrastructure, like ride-hailing platforms, so people will always have the option of selecting eco-friendly alternatives in transportation.

While shifting to fuel-efficient and electric cars can help us in reducing our carbon footprint, technology can also play a pivotal role in making our activities even more sustainable. And by using smart bins and state-of-the-art route optimisation technology, we are streamlining our operations further, reducing carbon emissions, fuel consumption, time, manpower and vehicle usage.

This week, we will showcase our innovations in clean energy and pioneering waste-to-energy technologies at the 24th World Energy Congress, which is being held in the UAE for the first time. Two of our joint venture entities, ION and Emirates Waste to Energy Company (EWTE), will exhibit regional firsts in sustainable transport and clean energy at the event.

We are proud to support UAE Vision 2021, building a more sustainable future for Sharjah and the UAE, and hope to embark on new projects that will align with this ambition and set an example for many others to follow suit. By doing so, we hope that our young people across the world will inherit a greener, more sustainable economy that works to the benefit of everyone.

Khaled Al Huraimel is group chief executive of Bee’ah. The World Energy Congress will take place September 9-12 at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC). Visitors can find the Emirates Waste to Energy Company at Stand 110 in Hall 8, and ION at Stand 126 in Hall 9, at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC).",United Arab Emirates,2019.09

Sanwo-Olu gave the advice during the launch of the Lagos Blue Box Initiative held in Lagos on Thursday.

According to him, recycling is a major fortune earner for government and youths.

“In Lagos, 50 per cent of waste generated contained reusable resources, which can be channel into the economy of the state.

“The recycling of waste encourages the use of another person’s scrap as a fixed stock for another person’s process.

“It minimises waste in our society and generates income for the citizens.

“The Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) is saddled with this responsibility of driving a circular economy through active community engagement.

”This will encourage the effective use of recyclable materials to create value chain and create new markets for government and the people.

“Currently, the bulk of the recyclables are being harvested from the dump sites by scavengers in the informal sector.

“The resources harvested often time could not pass the quality test that are needed, making it difficult for the recyclers to get value for the materials,” Sanwo-Olu said.

He said that there was the need to address this challenge as well as tap into the new business opportunity available in the sub sector, which had necessitated the launching of the Blue Box programme.

Also speaking, the wife of the governor, Dr Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, said that the Lagos Blue Box programme would make the environment cleaner, healthier and livable for all residents.

She said that the programme also would create more jobs for women through job creation, adding that zero waste was a collective responsibility of all.

In his remarks, the Commissioner for the Environment, Mr Tunji Bello, said that the dearth of sufficient land space had also affected adversely the state waste management strategy.

”We are unable to get adequate landfill activities to accommodate the huge waste being generated on a daily basis, estimated to have grown from 10,000 metric tones to 14,000 metric tones within a period of five years.

“This has necessitated our urge to rethink our strategy in waste management and one of which is waste sorting. Our ultimate aim is to attain waste conversation and waste buyback.

“And in the process, turning our waste into resources,” Bello said.

“And in the process, turning our waste into resources,” Bello said.The Managing Director, LAWMA, Dr Olumuyiwa Gbadegesin, gave a technical brief on how the initiative would work in the state.

He said that Lagosians were used to the old-fashioned style of dumping all waste in just one container, for eventual evacuation to the transfer loading station or landfill site by the PSP operators.

Gbadegesin said that the Blue Box Programme would encourage separation of recyclable materials from the general waste at the point of generation.

“We are advising that we should have two waste containers in our homes , a black container for waste, and a blue container for recyclables.

“To kickoff the Blue Box programme, we are distributing these colour-codes recycling bags to each household through franchised recyclers for separation of recyclables.

“The bags will be collected on designated dates or on the assigned days of the week.

“LAWMA will promote the sorting culture with a reward system and participatory households will accumulate coupons distributed by the franchisee.

“The coupons will be exchanged with several redeemable options which include, but not limited to, reduction in amount paid for waste bills,” Gbadegesin said.

He noted that recycles, who exhibited the capacity to collect at the Local Government and Local Council Development areas would be expected to have a minimum of between five trucks and 10 trucks for collection of recyclables from door steps.

The Founder of the Kids Beach Garden Lekki, Mrs Doyinsola Ogunye, who represented the Recycles Association of Nigeria (RAN) commended the Lagos State Government for being the first state to key into recycling of waste in the country.

She called on other states of the federation to join in the campaign.",Poland,2019.09

The loan was granted by ING Bank, UniCredit Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo Bank and OTP Bank, Green Group said in a press release on Thursday.

The new financing line supports efforts to stimulate a sustainable economic model, in line with EU regulations, which facilitates transition to circular economy and has a major impact on combating climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, the group is reducing the CO2 footprint of synthetic fibers produced from 100% recycled PET by 75% compared to their production from oil.

Green Group integrates the operations of six companies active in recycling: GreenTech, GreenFiber International, GreenWEEE International, GreenLamp Reciclare, GreenGlass Recycling and Total Waste Management.

Since 2016, the group has been owned by Abris Capital Partners, a private equity fund dedicated to investments in Central and Eastern Europe.

The group has since then invested 170 million euro in Romania and has a total recycling capacity of 460,000 tons of waste per year.",Bulgaria,2019.09

616,The Plastic Bank: reducing plastic waste by fighting poverty - Vatican News,"Nearly 9bn tons of plastic has been produced since it first went on sale as a mass-manufactured product in the early 1950s – and most of it is still around with some 8 million tons of plastic ending up in the planet’s oceans every year.

There are fears that by 2050 there could be more plastic in the oceans by weight than fish.

What’s more, 90% of that plastic waste is channeled into the ocean from 10 river systems running through Asia and Africa highlighting the fact that most plastic ocean waste is dispersed by the world’s poorer countries, and that the world’s poorest people are first in line paying the highest price for plastic pollution.

As Pope Francis says in his encyclical “Laudato Sì. On Care for Our Common Home,” we all need to acknowledge and take action on “our duty to care for the oceans as part of an integrated vision of human development”.

He points out that the oceans unite us and summon us to work together as “everything is interconnected” and oceans represent a crucial resource in the fight against poverty and climate change, both of which are intrinsically linked.

Partnering with an increasing number of multi-national and local brands, The Plastic Bank is a startup that aims to stop ocean-bound plastic and at the same time fight poverty by making plastic too valuable to discard.

It works according to a New Plastics Economy, which brings together business, government and other actors to rethink and redesign the future of plastic by reusing it wherever possible and ensuring it is recycled properly so that it stays within the plastic value chain – a concept known as the circular economy.

So, in partnership with the Plastic Bank, plastic recycling centers have sprung up mainly in poor Asian and African contexts in collaboration with a host of multi-national companies. When local waste collectors bring plastic to the centers, it is exchanged for cash, digital savings, healthcare, tuition, food, and other needs.

The win-win idea behind the project is that plastic is a major environmental pollutant, but its reuse could dramatically increase by providing people in poverty with the chance to earn money and improve the quality of their environment through recycling schemes, which, in the long term, will also help us better care for our common home.

David Katz, founder and CEO of the Plastic Bank was recently at the Vatican's Teutonic College to present the initiative.",Vatican City,2019.10
627,Finnish Embassy Shares Circular Economy Practices,"Finnish Ambassador Jari Sinkari said the seminar aimed to help local stakeholders come up with new ideas on how to implement a circular economy in Indonesia. (JG Photo/Nur Yasmin)

Jakarta. Finland's embassy in Indonesia held the first seminar on the circular economy to promote environmentally friendly business practices aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Finnish innovation fund Sitra delivered Finland's roadmap for the implementation of a circular economy during the event, attended by representatives of Indonesian government ministries, nongovernmental organizations and experts.

Ernesto Hartikainen, senior lead of carbon-neutral circular economy at Sitra, said a linear economy would see annual greenhouse gas emissions increase to 75 gigatons by 2060 from 40 gigatons currently, while a more circular economy would result in a 56 percent reduction in emissions from heavy industry alone by 2050.

M. Bijaksana Junerosano, managing director of Waste4Change, a social company that provides environmentally friendly waste management services, said Indonesia must implement a circular economy, as the country's waste output continues to increase. He said the country produced 65.8 million metric tons of waste in 2017, which increased to 66.5 million tons by 2018. Jakarta alone produces about 175,000 tons of waste per day.

Of the 175,000 tons, only about 7.5 percent can be composted and recycled, while about 69 percent goes to landfill sites, which produces methane gas.

""This is very bad management of waste. If these 175,000 tons of waste are managed along a circular economy model, the economic value would be Rp 101 trillion [$7.2 billion],"" Bijaksana said.

Finnish Ambassador Jari Sinkari said the seminar aimed to help local stakeholders come up with new ideas on how to implement a circular economy in the country.

""Indonesia needs new ideas and more cooperation; I believe politics is a marketplace of ideas,"" Sinkari said, adding that the Finnish Embassy was advocating greener policies to the Indonesian government, including creating green energy from waste.

""Indonesia is rich in geothermal and solar energy. Local companies are also cooperating with Finnish companies to provide clean energy. For example, Fortum and Jakarta Propertindo are engaged in a joint venture that will build energy plants to transform waste into electricity in Jakarta,"" the ambassador said.

The Finnish Embassy also cooperated with three students of Multimedia Nusantara University in Tangerang, Banten, to create a video campaign to educate the youth on a circular economy.

The students, Josh Rafael Gultom, Calita Hin and Kevin Junaldy, produced five videos during a two-month internship at the embassy.

""The concept is still very alien to most young people. These videos will familiarize the youth, especially millennials and younger, with the concept of a circular economy to create awareness of waste management,"" Josh said.

Waste4Change is partnering with the Finnish Embassy to present the third Indonesia Circular Economy Forum in Jakarta on Nov. 11-12.

""We want Indonesian stakeholders to sharpen their strategies and collaboration to make the circular economy a reality in Indonesia,"" Bijaksana said.",Indonesia,2019.10

857,Plastic Waste and the Shift to a Circular Economy,"As consumer appetite pushes companies toward sustainable innovation, Wall Street is taking notice: A recent investor survey by the Morgan Stanley Institute for Sustainable Investing showed plastic waste reduction, the circular economy and climate change among sustainability themes investors are most passionate about.

In April, Morgan Stanley became the first financial firm to announce its own commitment to mitigate plastic waste. Through the Morgan Stanley Plastic Waste Resolution, the firm will prevent, reduce and remove 50 million metric tons of plastic waste from entering rivers, oceans, landscapes and landfills by 2030. The resolution is a recent milestone in the firm’s long-running commitment to sustainability. Morgan Stanley started its Global Sustainable Finance group in 2009 to integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices into all core businesses, when much of Wall Street wasn’t yet looking at how such a strategy could create business opportunities.

Choi emphasized that the plastic waste problem is not just an environmental issue, but “an economic challenge, with up to $120 billion disappearing from the economy every year through the disposal of single-use plastics.”1 Finding a solution will require individuals do their part as well as collaboration between government, philanthropy, industry and finance, she says.

As demand grows for ESG investing, companies are addressing sustainability, specifically plastic waste, in novel ways: Start-ups and established consumer goods companies are creating sustainable packaging, while PepsiCo, Inc. recently announced its inaugural green bond offering. With Morgan Stanley as the sole green structuring advisor and lead underwriter, this $1 billion bond will fund sustainable initiatives across the company, including a commitment to reduce virgin plastic content in their supply chain by 35% by 2025.",N/A,2019.11

913,PepsiCo launches Live On platform in UAE to reduce use of plastic,"DUBAI, 17th November, 2019 (WAM) -- Under the auspices of Dr. Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, UAE Minister of Climate Change and Environment, PepsiCo, has announced the launch of Live On, its newly created sustainability platform for the UAE, and the Middle East and North Africa region, MENA.

The sustainability platform was launched at the Youth Hub in Emirates Towers in Dubai, with a unique Youth Circle event that was attended by Dr. Thani and PepsiCo’s first Chief Sustainability Officer, Simon Lowden, to have an open discussion on how to support the UAE and the Middle East to reduce the impact of plastic waste on the environment.

The Youth Circle initiative was launched by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, to ignite dialogue among the nation’s community of youth to shape innovative solutions for global challenges.

At the event, Lowden explained how the Live On platform allows the company to actively address its priorities for sustainable plastic use. The platform will focus on four key pillars: building consumer education, government collaboration, investing in recycling infrastructure and access, and reducing the overall impact of plastic waste.

""Plastics today are the reality of our lives at home and industry. While they cannot be completely eliminated, their indiscriminate use can certainly be controlled. The UAE strongly believes that managing plastic waste and steering the transition to a circular economy is everyone’s responsibility. In line with this priority, we have rolled out several nation-wide public-private partnerships,"" said Al Zeyoudi.

Also participating in the ceremony, Shamma bint Suhail Faris Al Mazrui, UAE Minister of State for Youth Affairs, Chairwoman of the Federal Youth Authority, said, ""As talents of today and leaders of tomorrow, youth are the most important ingredient to the circular economy equation, and must play an essential role in working towards it. The launch of the Live On sustainability platform comes in line with the UAE’s commitment to promote innovations in the circular economy, and gives the youth the opportunity to re-design the way our economy works.""

The first act of the platform will be the launch of a new consumer awareness campaign in the UAE to encourage the population to recycle plastic. Further campaigns will run in 2020 with key partners in the region.

Lowden added, ""Today’s launch is a proud moment for PepsiCo and another milestone in our alignment with the long-term vision of the UAE and the priorities of the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment. We are proud of the endorsement of the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment for our new platform, and it is a testament to our commitment to the region that we are able to collaborate with key regional partners, such as the UAE government, to support its strategic goals, such as developing a sustainable circular economy.""",United Arab Emirates,2019.11

985,Vietnam learns from Sweden’s experience in developing low carbon circular economy,"Addressing the event, Swedish Ambassador Ann Mawe said that as one of the world’s leading sustainable development countries, Sweden is aiming towards a zero-waste society.

Thanks to the people’s sense of environmental protection, the Government’s encouragement and an effective waste collection system, Sweden has achieved much progress in the “recycling revolution” over the past two decades, with the proportion of households’ recycled waste increasing from 38% in 1975 to 99% today, she stated.

The circular economy can be simply understood as “reducing, reusing and recycling”, which means the transformation of consumption patterns, the diplomat said, stressing Sweden’s willingness to share experience with Vietnam in the field.

According to MONRE Deputy Minister Vo Tuan Nhan, the circular economy brings many benefits to the nation, demonstrates its responsibility in solving global challenges posed by environmental pollution and climate change, and improves the competitiveness of the economy.

Recently, the Prime Minister assigned the MONRE to coordinate with some other ministries and relevant agencies to research and design policies to encourage the application of circular economic models in production and business activities, he released.

At the seminar, delegates discussed and shared Vietnam’s policies and visions in promoting the circular economy, the successful examples in Sweden and the region, and how enterprises can access capital sources when implementing this model.

One of Vietnam’s biggest obstacles in applying this model is the management of the collection and recycling of waste resources, which are considered the input materials in the circular economic model. Given that fact, participants discussed and shared the waste collecting and recycling models of Sweden, as well as the challenges and opportunities for waste recycling companies in Vietnam.

They also emphasised the formation of a partnership between the public and private sectors, which is a key condition for the low carbon circular economic model to extensively develop in Vietnam.

Jeffrey Fielkow, CEO of Tetra Pak Vietnam, emphasised that the environmental issues, such as climate change or waste, should not be considered individually, but they need to be looked at as a unified whole. To address these issues, an open circular economic model is required, which is not only a matter of recycling and reuse, but also the calculation of carbon in raw materials and production, to reduce the impacts of business activities on the environment.

Earlier, in June 2019, Tetra Pak (Sweden), the world’s leading food processing and packaging solutions company, cooperated with eight other leading companies in the field of consumer goods and packaging to establish the Packaging Recycling Organisation Vietnam (PRO Vietnam), with the desire to promote the circular economic model through the acceleration of the collection and recycling of product packaging.",Vietnam,2019.11

In Europe alone, several decades are needed. In Indonesia, waste management may have been underway though not optimally,"" Maramis stated.Circular economy translates to optimal utilization of goods. The concept of a circular economy strives to maintain product value, so that it can be used repeatedly without producing waste, or zero waste, in three ways: recycle, reuse, and re-manufacture.PRAISE, as an association of production and packaging companies comprising six members -- Coca Cola, Danone, Indofood, Nestle, Tetrapak, and Unilever -- has been implementing this concept by cooperating with several garbage banks, trash disposal sites, local governments, as well as ministries and institutions.On the same occasion, Bert Keesman, a representative of the Dutch companies in Indonesia, stated that the Netherlands had outlined a target to achieve 70 percent of the implementation of the circular economy in 2030 and is expected to achieve 100 percent of its implementation in all fields by 2050.""Currently, the Netherlands is able to recycle 80 percent of its waste, while 13 percent is yet in the process of incineration, and three percent of which we must admit is yet ending up in landfills. On the other hand, we are happy that increasingly more number of Dutch companies are moving towards the concept of circular economy,"" Keesman stated.EDITED BY INE",Indonesia,2019.11
