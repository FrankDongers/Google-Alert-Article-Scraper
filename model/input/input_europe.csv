2,Kelly Holmes to urge ministers to change dated fundraising laws,"OLYMPICS legend Dame Kelly Holmes will this week urge ministers to overhaul outdated fundraising laws that deny good causes millions of pounds.

The double gold medallist – whose charity has provided mentoring from sports stars to 240,000 youngsters – wants the Government to press ahead with changes to lottery rules.

Charity Minister Tracey Crouch launched a consultation in June to increase the amount they can raise in ticket sales from £10 million a year to £100 million.

It is also proposed to increase cap on prize money from £4 million to £5 million.

Dame Kelly says raising the move £100 million would make a “huge difference to charities like mine” as lotteries are freed to raise millions more pounds.

Under the current rules, bosses are having to turn down four out of five applications for funding from local charities because of the limits.

But Dame Kelly has joined a huge charity sector groundswell pressing the Government to go further and raise the draw limit to £10 million to “future-proof” the system.

The proposals are supported by The Lotteries Council, the Institute of Fundraising, the Hospice Lotteries Association and over 70 major charities.

She writes in The House magazine: “Charity lotteries are being held back in raising funds for charities and good causes by the outdated fundraising limits imposed on them.

“These limits cause severe administrative difficulties and result in considerable funds being diverted away to pay for the increased administration costs.

“As ministers finalise their plans for updating the law in this area I urge them not to miss this great opportunity to get the best deal for charities and all the amazing good causes they support.”

Dame Kelly, who won gold in both the 800m and 1500m at the 2004 Athens Olympics and set up her charity, the Dame Kelly Holmes Trust, joins fellow sporting legend Dame Ellen MacArthur in backing an overhaul of the current laws.

World record-setting solo sailor Dame Ellen, who runs charities to help children recover from cancer and move the world towards a circular economy, lent her support to the ideas earlier this year.

Dame Ellen said: “I know from my personal experience with the Ellen MacArthur Cancer Trust and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, just how important the funds raised by charity lotteries can be.

Support from players of People’s Postcode Lottery has enabled us to do charitable work that would simply not have been possible otherwise.

“It has allowed us to expand our work in supporting young people living with cancer to transform their lives through sailing, and also in tackling global issues like marine plastics.

I support efforts to make People’s Postcode Lottery’s work even more impactful by raising society lottery limits.”

Clara Govier, Managing Director of People’s Postcode Lottery, said: “Ministers have a chance to help us raise millions more for charities and good causes at no cost to the taxpayer. I hope they will join Dame Kelly and Dame Ellen to get these changes over the finish line and deliver a win-win that will help transform lives.”

5,Iceland chief calls for immediate support on recycling pledge,"THE head of packaging from Iceland Foods has told the Sunday National that urgent action must be taken to simplify recycling and give cons-umers confidence about where their plastic waste goes.



 Speaking ahead of a major environmental conference to be held in Edinburgh next week, Ian Schofield said the market-leading pledge by their chain to remove plastic packaging in the next five years must be supported by more clarity around recycling from government and local authorities.



 The Sunday National is campaigning to cut the use of plastic food packaging.



 Schofield said: “We all think all our councils are doing a great job with recycling but some of it goes in the ground and some of it was going to China. So we need to see some action now on the best recycling methods and I think consumers are starting to put pressure on government as well as on retailers. Consumers are getting very clued up.



 “The momentum of change is starting to take effect. We need a really easy-to-understand national method of getting rid of plastic waste packaging so that every person knows exactly where to put each material and what will happen to it – compost, recycled, re-used. 



 “So the big question for the [Scottish Government] is what are you doing to make sure that these products are being re-used and recycled properly and that consumers know for a fact that what they put into recycling will be treated properly?”



 Iceland have made the most meaningful commitments of all UK supermarkets in the fight against plastic waste. In January this year Iceland announced it would eliminate or drastically reduce plastic packaging of all its own-label products by the end of 2023, effecting more than 1000 of its own brand products. The chain has just over 2% of the UK supermarket mix.



 Using the hashtag #toocoolforplastic, managing director Richard Walker and his father, Iceland founder Sir Malcolm Walker, have been loudly campaigning against plastic waste in recent months.



 Schofield said the chain is taking the action because “the sea is full of plastic, and we’ve all seen Blue Planet and the havoc it’s causing, and at the start of this year we really just decided enough is enough. In January I was about to launch a children’s food range and it was all wrapped in plastic – ridiculous really.



 “In effect we are removing 13,000 tonnes of plastic and 3000 tonnes of carrier bags over the next five years.”



 Other retailers including Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s, Aldi and Lidl have signed up to the UK Plastics Pact which promises to move to 100% of plastic packaging to be reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025.

 Schofield said Iceland Foods would not be joining the Plastics Pact.

“We’ve made the most serious commitment, and we’ll deliver on our promise years ahead of anyone else. We applaud what they are doing but we are removing plastics completely in five years, and if we can do it so can others.



 “I am scouring the world, universities and research centres to find materials that will wrap frozen, chilled and eventually grocery products to remove plastic. One of my biggest challenges is not finding the materials, it’s doing it cost effectively. The consumer can’t afford to pay for this, so we are looking for really good innovations.”



 Schofield added that he is personally reflective about changes in the industry. “The ironic thing was that 40 years ago when I trained as a packaging technologist, including in some Co-op factories up in Scotland and the fish factory we had in Aberdeen, I was moving everything from natural products like board and cellulose into plastic, “ he said. “And 40 years later I’m taking them out.”



 Schofield is a keynote speaker at the Scottish Resources Conference in Edinburgh next week, hosted by Zero Waste Scotland, Sepa and CIWM, the charted body for waste professionals. Over 400 policy makers, entrepreneurs, inventors, business leaders, academics and investors will discuss marine litter prevention, the new Deposit Return scheme, biodegradable landfill ban and Zero Waste Towns.



 Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham is expected to make an announcement on Scottish Government policy at the event.



 On Thursday night the Scottish Resources Awards will recognise game changers in the industry, as well as a new award for young to mark the Year of Young People.



 Iain Gulland, Chief Executive of Zero Waste Scotland said: “It is really encouraging to see Scotland’s young people making a difference in Scotland’s efforts to create a more circular economy.”",Scotland,2018.09

7,Opinion | Destroying Clothes Is Fashion’s Dirty Secret. And We're Complicit.,"You get the sense that luxury fashion label Burberry very much regrets its decision to burn $38 million of unsold stock rather than let it fall into the wrong hands. It was embarrassing. The Burberry burn — #burnberry on social media — broke as a huge story in July, just two months after the brand announced it was a core signatory to Making Fashion Circular, an initiative aiming to design waste out of fashion and keep resources in circulation. When you cremate clothes, that’s obviously not going to happen. The materials are lost. It’s the antithesis of the circular economy. The company moved to stem the fierce criticism and this month announced it would immediately cease incinerating clothes. But the backlash shined some light on the practice of destroying fashion. Burberry had not tried to hide its use of incineration, which was listed in its 2017/2018 annual report under “finished goods physically destroyed during the year.” But most brands don’t talk publicly about the practice, which they have no obligation to disclose. So why do they do it? Most often, the reason is to avoid devaluing the brand; there is a terror of what discounting would do to prestige. Some brands, such as Chanel, never discount. The idea is, keep it scarce and you keep it exclusive. Over the last two years, Cartier owner Richemont, for example, has bought back about $575 million worth of watches from retail partners to avoid having the timepieces sold more cheaply on the gray market of unauthorized retailers. Most were destroyed, and the parts were recycled.

It’s not just high-end brands that are destroying their stock. Fast fashion is at it too. In 2017 it was revealed that fashion behemoth H&M — which has made much of its green agenda with recycling points in stores and what it calls a Conscious Collection — burned about 19 tons of obsolete clothing (the equivalent to 50,000 pairs of jeans) in a waste-to-energy facility run by one of Sweden’s energy giants, Mälarenergi. H&M said that the clothes were unsellable for safety reasons — for example, they didn’t meet restrictions on chemicals or had been damaged by mold. The company used the same defense again this month after the German current affairs program “Frontal 21” dedicated a show to an investigation into the burning of unsold H&M stock in Germany, alleging that the brand destroyed 100,000 pieces of clothing unsold from multiple seasons. And Nike was the subject of a New York Times article in 2017 that alleged the company slashed clothing and shoes to render them unwearable before disposing of them. Public outcry over the destruction of fashion overstock shows that these methods of disposal carry an unofficial public approval rating close to zero. To input all the resources, emit so much pollution and waste and then destroy those clothes is pure madness, given the ecological emergencies we face. Waste and fashion go hand in glove. The industry continues to pump out a swelling inventory; each year, north of 100 billion new garments from virgin fibers are pushed onto the market. H&M alone was reported in March to have $4.3 billion worth of unsold clothes. The energy needs of fashion are incredible. More often than not — particularly in fast fashion — these demands are shouldered by developing economies with scant or patchy energy cover. A Cambodian factory producing garments for export, for example, needs power to iron and dye clothes. The French environmental organization Geres estimated that garment factories in Phnom Penh burn through 2.3 million cubic feet of wood every month. To feed wood-fired boilers, factories are clearing old-growth forests. Then there are the emissions. The fashion industry pumps out more carbon dioxide than international flights and shipping combined, according to a 2017 Ellen MacArthur Foundation report.

There are moves to change the practice of destroying fashion overstock, although few address the issue in any systematic way. An insider from the luxury goods sector who wished to remain anonymous said that the days of luxury design houses’ incineration of substantive collections that have failed to sell is probably gone. “Instead, there’s a cascade. Unsold stock is put through outlets, or garments and accessories disassembled and used in different ways. For example, the hardware like the zips and buttons can be removed. Incineration is the last resort.” When it comes to this cascade, luxury goods brands have more options and more leverage than fast fashion brands. There are arguably more opportunities to reclaim their products and re-enter them in the supply chain. But fast fashion brands, already at low price and high volume, shouldn’t expect to be invited into discount luxury outlets anytime soon. Because fast fashion makes up the lion’s share of the average wardrobe and is bought and discarded quickly, when we talk about today’s out-of-kilter fashion consumption and disposal, we are really talking about this market.

 Many people look to clothing recycling as a more acceptable and promising way of managing our fashion waste. Sure, there is vast potential; that is a given when the entry point is runaway consumption and resource use. But anybody who thinks we can miraculously scale up fashion recycling to counteract overproduction is verging on the delusional. There is progress being made in the pursuit of recycled fiber. You might have noticed a big increase in the amount of fashion on the market made of yarn from recycled waste fishing nets, for example.

But this is still mostly tinkering around the edges. What’s important to understand: It’s not exciting innovation that will make recycling viable but dull old legal curbs on retailers, manufacturers and distributors. Here, France leads the way. Regulation there now means that fashion producers must take responsibility for the end of life of the clothing they put on the French market, usually through participation in collecting and recycling programs.Other French initiatives are trying to limit the amount of different sorts of fibers that fashion producers may place on the French market. Complexity is the enemy of all recycling schemes. But this French revolution is an anomaly. Elsewhere, including the U.S., there seems to be little appetite to curb the unsustainable habits of brands and get them to take real responsibility. The fact is that with a global fashion inventory this huge, even with an injection of good ideas and innovation, recycling will never triumph.

 This brings us to a difficult conclusion as consumers. We hate incineration and destruction generally, but we’re continuing to prop up the low-cost, high-volume system that makes it an inevitability. It’s estimated that we buy about 60 percent more clothes annually than we did in 2000 and wear each item less before ditching it. Per capita, Americans send about 70 pounds of textiles a year to landfills. When are we going to look at our own consumption habits and demand that fashion brands produce fewer clothes?

19,Net zero emissions possible in Europe by 2050,"The range of measures used to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) needs to be widened, with more focus on how we operate as a society such as eating meat, a study has concluded.

The research, by the European Climate Foundation and Climact, a climate and energy consultancy, stated that to be on a trajectory to net-zero by 2050, GHG emissions in Europe will need to be reduced by between 55 to 65 percent compared to 1990 levels by 2030.

This means a significant increase in ambition from the current EU 2030 target of 40 percent. The next 10 years are therefore critical, it said.

Commercially-available solutions can already take Eurrope about 75 percent of the way to net-zero if deployed at scale, it said. The remaining 25 percent can be achieved based on known approaches and techniques for which further scaling up and commercialisation is needed.

The researchers recommended more focus on how we operate as a society, for example, the introduction of circular economy principles so that products are designed to last longer, which can have major trickle-down effects on the entire value chain.

Meat consumption must be reduced by 25 percent (and at least halved by 2050) by 2030, without increasing consumption of dairy products, it stated.

Julien Pestiaux, partner at Climact, said: “What has really struck us during our research is how attainable the transition to zero emissions is: most of the tools we need are already available across all sectors, and using them will redirect the huge financial flows spent on fossil fuels back in to the European economy.”

The benefits of the transition “massively outweigh” the additional investments needed, particularly given that consumers are starting to understand circular economy principles, for example in relation to plastics, he added.

As reported by The Ecologist this week, the Labour party has committed to the target for UK emissions to be slashed to “net zero” by the middle of the century, boosting ambition from the current 80 percent set in the Climate Change Act, if they come to power.

Attila Chikán Jr. president of the Business Council for Sustainable Development in Hungary and CEO of alternative and renewable energy specialist ALTEO Group, talks to the Budapest Business Journal about the impact of the council and the growth of sustainability in Hungary.

BBJ: How and when was the BCSDH formed?

Attila Chikán Jr.: The Business Council for Sustainable Development in Hungary was established in 2007 as the national partner organization of World Business Council for Sustainable Development. Several companies and private individuals believed that businesses should also take actions for sustainability in Hungary, therefore they founded the BCSDH. Since then, the organization has evolved into a value-creating community of business leaders of companies who presently employ more than 400,000 people and contribute approximately 30% of Hungary’s GDP. Currently our most important task is to promote the incorporation of the principles of sustainable corporate governance into practice, while actively contributing to the achievement of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.

BBJ: How has it changed since 2007?

AC: In 2007, BCSDH started with 15 members, and now, 11 years later, the number of member companies has grown to 81. Through the years, the council has become a unique, leading organization in its area, and connects to the government, private and business sectors as well.

BBJ: What is the significance of its membership today?

AC: The members are known to be the biggest companies with the power of influence in Hungary. Under the frameworks like the SDGs and the Paris Agreement, our members work together on big questions, such as: how do we get to net zero emissions by 2050? And how can we avoid wasting a third of the food we produce while millions of people still go hungry every day? Membership gives businesses the value, impact and voice to navigate this change and prosper by transforming themselves and the world. Members develop business solutions that are scalable, measurable, impactful and beyond “business as usual”.

BBJ: How and why did you get involved with the BCSDH?

AC: Personally, I believe that sustainability is the future of businesses. The energy sector, in which ALTEO operates, is strongly linked to sustainability and renewable energy as well. Sustainability is a significant part of ALTEO’s corporate management strategy; we shape our portfolio and investment decisions in line with this attitude. My personal vision and aim is to acquaint people with and spread responsible and sustainable corporate governance principles as widely as possible, and to provide the opportunity for Hungarian companies to become more sustainable on their own area. I also served as the head of the Action2020 Working Group for a couple of years, which has been a great experience and an exciting trip.

BBJ: How has awareness of sustainability and green business changed over the years?

AC: BCSDH was founded almost 11 years ago, which was actually the period of the culmination of corporate sustainability in Hungary. In order to be able to follow the trends, the current state and future prospects of the corporate sustainability of the council’s recommendations, we have carried out a BCSDH survey every year since 2013.

Although our survey indicates that progress with corporate sustainability in Hungary still lags behind global trends, more and more domestic company leaders are reporting that they value environmental responsibility and are preparing for the emergence of a carbon-neutral economy – one of the significant elements in a corporate sustainability strategy. The adoption of climate-related BCSDH recommendations from 2016 is clearly identifiable in the 2017 survey.

BBJ: Would you say business is driving the sustainability agenda now, or responding to market/public demands?

AC: Our opinion is that, in Hungary, companies are driving the sustainability agenda now, and we know that the global markets go through a slow transformation. Markets move toward true-value pricing and long-term value creation. Besides the birth of environmental and economic crises and the spread of “green” values by education and the media, these initiatives encourage “One World – People and Planet” behavior in society and individuals worldwide.

BBJ: What are the most important projects the council working on right now?

AC: One of our flagship programs is the “Action 2020 Hungary Program” that calls on the Hungarian business sector to take immediate action. The program is the Hungarian adaptation of the global program of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. Within the program, five priority areas (Food and Feed; Sustainable Lifestyles; Employment; Climate Change; and Water) and 20 specific macro-level goals are defined. This year, this program has a special focus on Sustainable Lifestyles.

The aim of our “Future Leaders Talent Program” is to help potential business leaders, who today are currently talented professionals, to understand the complexity of corporate sustainability and to enable them to incorporate sustainability into their future decision-making processes. This program is unique in Hungary.

BBJ: What future sustainability trends do you expect to impact business?

AC: Most business leaders in Hungary feel that the circular economy is the future, in accordance with what we also forecast at the WBCSD. The proposed circular economy directive of the European Union is an obvious sign of its implementation into legislation. Transitioning to a circular economy is one of the greatest business opportunities nowadays. The core of the concept is not yet deeply acknowledged by most companies, although use of this model can increase the flexibility of the economy and facilitate the achievements of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

BBJ: How does Hungary compare with its peers when it comes to sustainability?

AC: If we look over our performance in the context of Sustainable Development Goals, we are at the end of the line compared to the close Western countries. Concerning our ecological footprint, we exceed our biocapacity, and we have an ecological deficit. Mostly it is these facts that force us to move towards more sustainable lifestyles.",Hungary,2018.09
22,Metal Recycer EMR Supports Local Children in Dundee,"Privately owned metal recycling firm EMR, has partnered with Aberfoyle Childcare, a care centre for children across Dundee, to help children to get outdoors and explore nature.

23,Parliamentarians: Europe and Asia are the two pillars to take world forward,"Multilateralism is the most effective mechanism to deal with climate change, said, participants of the 10th Asia-Europe Parliamentary Partnership Meeting held in Brussels on 27-28 September.

Environmental challenges facing Asia and Europe were the central theme of the meeting, which brought together MEPs and MPs from EU member states, 18 Asian countries and Russia, Australia, New Zealand, Norway and Switzerland.

Those challenges include sustainable development and the circular economy, urban areas management, cooperation on water resources, waste treatment and plastic reduction, food security and clean technologies.

The meeting at parliamentarian level is also seen as a preparation for the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) summit to be held in Brussels on 18-19 October. MPs and MEPs, as well as the leaders of 30 European and 21 Asian countries, meet bi-annually.

MEP Heidi Hautala (Greens, Finland), who chaired the meeting, spoke about the impact of climate change on many walks of life.

“Even in my country, we had a very exceptional summer,” she said.

Wildfires have raged this year in the Arctic Circle, and drought has punished food producers in Nordic areas, which usually abound in water and rain.

Hautala said that MEPs and MPs had a lot to achieve in the framework of the Paris agreement and that the onus was now on “ambition and implementation”.

She warned that in all climate change action, parliamentarians needed to make sure that human rights, the rights of indigenous people and their land rights are respected.

The Finnish MEP also stressed that some Asian partners are at the forefront of the fight against climate change while the EU sometimes lags behind. China and India are leaders in transforming their traffic systems to electric vehicles, she said.

“It’s not good enough to adopt every two years a joint declaration. Our role should be more ambitious. We represent many millions and citizens expect us to be more ambitious in shaping the future and addressing common challenges we are addressing in Europe, Asia and beyond, to promote sustainable development”, Hautala said.

Yondonperenlei Baatarbileg, chairman of the committee of public policy, culture and science of the Mongolian parliament, reminded that his country had successfully organised the 9th ASEP in 2016, with the theme “partnership for future of connectivity”.

Without mentioning the USA under Donald Trump, he said the balance of power in the world was shifting and the multilateral mechanisms were therefore of utmost importance. This idea was further repeated by almost all speakers.

Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury, the speaker of the Bangladeshi parliament, said multilateralism was the most effective mechanism for dealing with climate change, and also poverty eradication, food security, inequality, conflict resolution, migration and refugee issues.

She didn’t mention the tragedy of the Rohingya, but was obviously referring to the exodus of the Rohingya people, who are fleeing to Bangladesh to escape the violence in Myanmar.

Chaudhury stressed that ASEP could be instrumental in shaping global parliamentary diplomacy, in persuading all players to take action. She also warned that international financing mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund and the Least Developed Countries’ Fund were severely under-resourced.

Zhang Zhijun, vice-chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the National Peoples’ Congress of China compared the 10th Asia-Europe Parliamentary Partnership Meeting to “a prelude to a symphony” ahead of the upcoming ASEM summit.

He also stressed that last summer, the whole northern hemisphere was engulfed in heatwaves, bringing drought and wildfires and proving that climate change was not a problem for future generations but for today.

The Chinese parliamentarian said that if politicians had “an outdated mentality”, this would harm their own country and others. He argued that what was needed was a global climate governance system that is fair and equitable and based on win-win cooperation.

MEP Jo Leinen (S&D, Germany), who is the Parliament’s rapporteur on climate change and the chair of the Delegation for relations with China, said that “unfortunately in this moment when we need multilateralism” the concept was “attacked by some people” who want to go their own way, “and that’s a challenge for all of us”.

Leinen said he was happy that although the US government had walked out on the Paris Agreement, all other countries had confirmed they would continue to implement it.

The German MEP said Europe and Asia had a different history, with industrialisation that started in Europe in the nineteenth century, while Asia has the biggest population and the fastest growth, and a chance to modernise as they grow.

He voiced hope that Europe and Asia were “the two pillars to bring the world ahead”.",Belgium,2018.09

35,Half of Europe not on track with waste recycling,"Fourteen EU member states have to step up efforts to reach the target of recycling 50% of municipal waste in 2020 – an objective set by the framework directive in 2008. EURACTIV France’s media partner, the Journal de l’environnement, reports.

Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Spain, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Malta, Poland, Romania and Slovakia are under close surveillance.

On 24 September, Brussels provided them with a roadmap to respect one of the key objectives of the 2008 framework directive (50% recycling of municipal waste in 2020), while the Circular Economy Package raised the bar to 55% in 2025

This comprehensive document, which is supplemented by national warnings, was produced in light of the 2013-2015 reports sent by member states on the implementation of the main waste directives (framework directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment, packaging, landfill and sewage waste).

The document prioritises the growth of extended producer responsibility sectors, the development of incentive economic resources – such as raising taxes on landfill and incineration – and improving waste data.

“The Commission is there to provide technical assistance, support through the structural funds and share best practices,” declared Karmenu Vella, the Commissioner for environment.

40,Association of Plastic Recyclers presents on circular economy,"Steve Alexander, president and CEO of the Association of Plastic Recyclers, presented ‘APR: Your Conduit to the Circular Economy’, in the TLMI Ecovillage at Labelexpo Americas 2018.

Circular economy, a model endorsed by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, promotes the recovery and restoration of products, components, and materials through strategies like reuse, repair, remanufacture or recycling.

‘At end of the day, there needs to be a market demand for the recycling industry,’ said Alexander.

He added the pressure for brands to meet stricter recycling regulations will only intensify in the coming months. ‘To close the [circular economy] loop, packaging needs to get collected and recycled into new products. You can’t expect to generate quality secondary product with bad product going in.’

The first step to meeting product recyclability guidelines starts in the early creative stages. ‘We [APR] continue to be awed by the lack of understanding on the implication of not designing for recyclability,’ said Alexander. ‘We go to consumer brands to train engineers on our design program because we want product design engineers to design for recyclability from the inception.’

Anticipated challenges to responsible design, production and recycling will largely concern added expenses. ‘Asking your customers to change the composition of their products can be difficult for their marketing, procurement and costs to produce,’ explained Alexander. ‘When you’re trying to make a change and increase pricing, it’s not an easy push.’

An impressive crowd convened in the TLMI Ecovillage feature area at Labelexpo Americas 2018 for industry updates and changing requirements to global plastics protocol.

One attendee asked if more stringent recycling regulations will push some brands away from plastic products altogether, to which Alexander replied: ‘Yes,, but the recycling rates for some of those other products are not as strong as they once were.

41,Bottles becoming bottles: Let’s go full circle!,"The time has come for the European Parliament’s last opportunity to take concrete action before handing over the reins to the EU’s successors: making it mandatory to produce plastic bottles with at least 25% of recycled plastics by 2025.

The European Parliament’s last chance to act comes mid-October when they will vote on a draft report that recommends making it mandatory to produce beverage containers with at least 25% of recycled plastics by 2025. If this is voted and followed by the Council of the European Union, Member States will need to reach this target by 2025, making an enormous leap towards a completely circular economy.

The word “plastic” and even more specifically “single-use plastics” has been on everyone’s lips, especially this past year. It seems that the EU has a perpetual thorn in its side, a plastic thorn, that is.

In the EU alone, 26 million tonnes of plastic waste is produced of which barely 30% go to recycling processes with the purpose of being reincorporated into new products. New plastic items, such as beverage bottles, incorporate in a best-case scenario only 7% of plastic recyclates!

To counter this problem, one of the measures proposed by the European Commission is to collect 90% of plastic bottles by 2025. A good initiative, but nonetheless incomplete. Collecting plastic will not be enough to steer the plastic market towards producing fewer single-use bottles.

Making it compulsory to collect 90% of plastic bottles is key in preventing them from invading our rivers, beaches and oceans, but it will not help plastic producers in shifting from single-use to recyclable bottles, nor to reincorporate recycled bottles into new ones.

For this, only mandatory recycled content can give the signal to plastic producers, and the economic visibility to the waste management industry which will trigger investments for collecting, sorting, and preparing recyclable bottles. If these factors align, the loop will close. Mandatory recycled content will help bridge the price gap of plastic recyclates, and help finance the collection system.

Many brands have already pledged to incorporate recycled content into their packaging, but only by obligating companies to integrate recycled plastics in plastic bottles will they revise their way of designing these bottles to facilitate recycling.

This will break the never-ending vicious circle of beverage plastic bottles that are used only once. Producers will have to shift away from the latter in order to favour food grade plastics that can be recycled. Quite literally, bottles becoming bottles.

In order to innovate and expand the separate collection, sorting and recycling capacity, for all plastics, at EU level, the waste management industry will need to invest up to € 10 billion worth of investments.

Our sector is prepared to make the necessary investments if there are legislative measures ensuring a significant uptake of plastic recyclates; which is becoming even more necessary by the minute in view of the Chinese ban on imports of certain waste streams. Mandatory 25% content would be the perfect green light for our industry.

If this is guaranteed, the high collection target and our investment will enable us to provide the quantity and the quality needed by the producers to incorporate recycled content into their beverage containers.

MEPs will vote and decide mid-October if they want mandatory recycled content in plastic bottles to be part of their legacy. This is the EP’s last opportunity to act before the end of their mandate: if not now, the EU will lose at least 3 years! We can no longer sit back and wait for this problem to go away, the time to act is now.",Belgium,2018.09
44,New recycling project could ensure that no plastic is left behind,"Iain Gulland, Chief Executive of Zero Waste Scotland sheds light on a new recycling project which aims to ensure that no plastic is left behind

When it comes to unintended consequences, few examples are as dramatic as plastic.

 Fully synthetic plastics are now more than a century old and in that time they have utterly transformed our world. Such is the huge range of products that make use of plastics, it’s hard to imagine a world without them.

But their influence extends well beyond our homes and offices. In the waste and recycling sector, “the Blue Planet Effect” has almost certainly become the mostused phrase of 2018. The public has been rightly shocked at the devastation being reaped upon our oceans by plastic pollution. And that crisis is not limited to the sea.

To further complicate the picture, the Chinese government has announced import restrictions on plastic waste. The UK had been shipping up to half a million tonnes of plastic to China each year for recycling – with that avenue now closed, domestic solutions become an even more urgent priority.

The huge volume of public concern around plastic has led to a flurry of action by governments at all levels. The European Commission has launched its plastics strategy, which includes a commitment for all plastic packaging on the market to be 100% recyclable by 2030. The UK government has pledged to eradicate all ‘avoidable’ plastic waste by 2042 while Scottish ministers have announced plans to introduce legislation to ban the manufacture and sale of plastic stemmed cotton buds as well as establishing an Expert Panel to offer advice on further actions on specific plastic items. These commitments are great to see but it’s going to take more than legislation and targets to make this happen – innovation will be key.

That’s why we’re proud to be supporting Project Beacon. The project combines existing and innovative mechanical and chemical recycling through three principal players (PI-Polymer Recycling, Recycling Technologies Ltd and Impact Recycling Ltd) to create a world-first Advanced Plastics Reprocessing facility at Binn Eco Park in Perthshire. Zero Waste Scotland is investing £1.7 million through our Circular Economy Investment fund – a fund made possible thanks to investment from both the Scottish Government and the European Regional Development Fund through the Resource Efficient Circular Economy Accelerator Programme Fund.

Project Beacon responds to a fundamental issue facing those of us trying to increase recycling rates. Many people are still confused about what items they can recycle. Project Beacon will demonstrate a system that enables householders to recycle all household plastics at the kerbside, part of their mission to make sure that ‘no plastic is left behind’.

The system uses new state-of-the-art separation systems to support mechanical recycling but fuses this with a game-changing chemical feedstock recycling process. This includes a patented process based on thermal cracking, which recycles end-of-life plastic

 waste that typically cannot be recycled using mechanical methods – for example, mixed, laminated, black, film and even contaminated plastic waste. This new process produces a range of chemical constituents that can be used to reform new virgin plastics or other

 chemical products. This has the potential to convert over 90% of all received plastics to new value-added uses. This would allow local authorities to collect ‘all plastic in one bin’ at the kerbside, removing the uncertainty many people feel over what plastics can and cannot be recycled at home. The Project Beacon facility will demonstrate a circular solution with the potential to scale up globally – if Scotland can recycle 90% of its plastic waste then so can other countries facing similar challenges.

The facility will process between 15,000 and 25,000 tonnes of plastics per annum and create over 70 new jobs. The money we have invested has been more than matched by the private sector. This is a sign that investors are convinced circular economy approaches to issues like plastic are not just good for the planet, they are potentially lucrative opportunities. I hope it will serve as a positive example to other businesses in Scotland of the exciting opportunities offered by our country’s growing circular economy.

It’s set to be an exciting time for those of us working to curb plastic waste in Scotland. The Scottish Government has also announced plans for a deposit return scheme, which Zero Waste Scotland is helping to design. With Scotland also the host nation for this year’s Circular Economy Hotspot from 30 October to 1 November, this will profile Scottish businesses action on the circular economy to an international audience, so there’s a real momentum behind transforming Scotland’s economy towards a model where things are made to last.",United Kingdom,2018.09

58,ReFood responds to the Resources and Waste Strategy,"Recently DEFRA launched its long-awaited Resources and Waste Strategy – an ambitious policy paper guiding England’s national approach to embrace a circular economy. Commenting on the report’s commitments to minimising food waste, Philip Simpson, commercial director at ReFood, provided the following analysis.

“DEFRA’s Resources and Waste Strategy has been positioned as a national commitment to leaving our planet in a better position than we found it for the next generation. At first glance, the vision seems highly positive – new recycling targets, initiatives to combat plastic waste, PRN reform and the eagerly-anticipated government commitment to zero food waste to landfill.

“However, after reading the report in more depth, you uncover a distinct lack of clarity, loose targets and failure to embrace legislation – especially when it comes to minimising food waste. While numerous ambitions outlined within the report are indeed positive (such as further investment into redistribution schemes, appointing a ‘Waste Champion’ and providing guidance for the supply chain), weekly collections and a ban on food waste to landfill are once again subject to ‘consultation’.

“In my experience, this means delays, doubt and the ability to back-track. Even if the consultation is successful, legislation wouldn’t come into force until at least 2023 – more than four years away. There is also no mention of cost to the householder, details of how such a scheme would operate or the national uniformity of collections. Surely all instrumental questions if we are truly serious on banning food waste to landfill?

“The strategy also fails to outline how England’s food waste model would integrate with Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, which already operate successful schemes, or how we intend to update our waste infrastructure to make the whole process achievable.

“We need clear government commitment, realistic guidance and a serious action plan to prevent 10 million tonnes of food waste from being thrown away every year. This can’t be optional and certainly can’t be seen as a long-term strategic ambition, ‘subject to consultation’.

“I’d hoped that the Resources & Waste Strategy would have given more clarity and outlined a comprehensive action plan to properly ban food waste from landfill. If we wait until 2023 (subject to lengthy and unnecessary discussions), we watch another 40,000,000 tonnes of food landfilled, maintain our position as the world’s third largest polluter and provide yet another opportunity to back-track on our commitments.

“The business case, both economic and environmental, for banning food waste to landfill has been around for years. Best practice approaches are widespread and should be embraced. While the Resources and Waste Strategy presents an exciting vision, we need to turn this into reality – and fast – to start working towards a more circular economy.”

62,Waste management,"Plastic bottles, straws and empty snack packets flood the Lami Foreshore. Plastics are particularly problematic in Fiji because of inadequate waste management services. Picture: JOVESA NAISUA

PLASTICS are particularly problematic in Fiji because of inadequate waste management services.

These were the sentiments shared by the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and the Environment David Boyd, who visited the country earlier to evaluate how Fiji’s global environmental and human rights commitments were translated into national implementation.

Mr Boyd said without having adequate waste management services, led to the burning of garbage containing plastic which produced highly carcinogenic dioxins and furans.

“Fijians are increasingly concerned about plastic’s environmental impacts on oceans in particular. Plastic refuse has also been implicated in blocking drainage systems, exacerbating the serious problem of flooding,” Mr Boyd said.

“A plastic bag levy of ten cents per bag was introduced by the Government and raised to twenty cents with the intention of banning plastic bags in 2020.”

He said these were good steps, but a more comprehensive approach to the problems posed by plastic was needed.

“Given the substantial costs involved in recycling plastic items, a particularly promising approach is extended producer responsibility (EPR), which shifts the burden of collection from governments to the industries that produce or import packaging or products,” he said.

“EPR regulations have proven effective in other nations not only for plastic bottles and packaging, but also for a wide range of products and packaging including batteries, newspapers, tyres, consumer electronics, whitegoods and motor vehicles,” said Mr Boyd.

He added that Fiji should give serious consideration to this policy instrument as a priority in improving waste management and moving towards a circular economy.",Ireland,2018.12
63,Anthesis: putting theory into best practice,"Energy Digital spoke with Anthesis CSO Paul Crewe to learn how the global sustainability services and solutions consultancy can help businesses deliver financially-driven sustainability strategies underpinned by technical innovation.

Taking its name from the Greek word for the stage of a plant’s lifecycle when it is most productive, Anthesis was founded in 2013 and driven by the determination to reduce risk, increase resilience and realise opportunity to deliver truly sustainable organisations. Employing a team of 260 with a global reach across 11 countries, Anthesis develop financially-driven sustainability strategies that go hand in hand with commercial success, anchored by technical innovation. “We have grown organically through acquisitions to be able to provide support for all the key aspects of sustainability; from energy reduction, regeneration and storage, to waste and resource management, the circular economy and carbon footprint reduction,” explains CSO Paul Crewe. “Within the group we also have a sustainable chemistry division helping organisations fulfil their legal requirements and a team focused on compliance for CDP (Carbon Disclosure Projects) as part of our sustainability strategy, which also supports the United Nations sustainable development goals.”

Meanwhile, its software design division is able to create bespoke platforms and applications for businesses to help them achieve those sustainability goals. “We are unique in the fact that we don’t just provide traditional consultancy advice, we’re able to offer absolute solutions to aid the delivery of sustainability initiatives,” adds Crewe. “Additionally, in the area of energy and renewables we provide support with alternative financing to access funds to accelerate the delivery of those technologies at scale and at pace.”

Allied to its bespoke software solutions, Anthesis also focus on physical technologies to drive significant benefits and savings in areas like energy, where the company is constantly looking for the next innovation to share with clients to make meaningful step changes towards driving out carbon and reducing energy consumption. “We’re partnering with an aerofoil technology company to significantly reduce the refrigerated energy load within display cases in retail supermarkets,” reveals Crewe. “The tech is actually based on the aerofoil blade used on the back of a Williams Formula 1 car and adapted to fit the edge of a shelf in open refrigerated cabinets. Like the automotive aerofoil, which helps keep a car firmly on the road at high speed, in its vertical position an aerofoil shelf works by keeping the cold air trained inside the case rather than pouring out into the aisle and wasting energy.”

In Crewe’s previous role as Head of Sustainability, Engineering, Energy and the Environment at Sainsbury’s, he supported the introduction of this technology across the whole of the supermarket giant’s estate to deliver significant energy reductions. “At Anthesis we’re helping to roll this solution out across the world enabling our customers to accelerate their plans with economical business cases with a proven ROI,” he adds.

Alongside such practical innovations, digital platforms have allowed for the creation of software systems which ingest data on a massive scale to deliver information that is informative, intuitive and capable of providing actionable insights, based on what is actually happening in an organisation, to drive cost effective solutions that can also provide a positive impact with regard to climate change and sustainability. “It’s an important area of focus for Anthesis,” admits Crewe. “We not only help organisations understand their energy consumption at a micro level, with the data platforms we deploy we also become very intuitive around what a building, project or operation should be doing via self-learning within those environments. People can be quite blasé about data but it’s a vital part of business transformation and understanding your supply chain’s end-to-end commodity needs (from materiality to the environment and the social governance relating to a product) to help businesses make the right decisions both financially and environmentally. The cloud is critical here… Data that’s easily accessible will drive efficiency and awareness at speed and at scale.”

Once just a word used as part of a CSR plan, Crewe believes sustainability is now unequivocally mainstream, having become a critical commercial aspect of any organisation. “Once they understand what sustainability means for them it can inform business decisions and have a massive impact,” he argues. “For example, energy, along with wages, is often the highest controllable cost, so with the rising cost of carbon taxation on energy it’s an area we can help businesses both mitigate against and create revenue streams through the deployment of renewable energy and storage. The CFOs of companies embracing sustainability are understanding it does have a critical commercial aspect to stay optimised and efficient with a positive impact on the bottom line.”

What advice would he give companies eager to achieve this type of positive impact on their sustainability journey? “Regardless of the sector, if you can truly understand how your business operates from an energy, waste, water and carbon perspective, these key drivers of cost generation can become revenue income opportunities. Working with an organisation like Anthesis can help pinpoint demonstrable gains, programs of investment and positive behaviour change to drive those in real time,” asserts Crewe, whose time with Sainsbury’s enabled him to help organisations across the globe understand both the social and economic impact of sustainability: “I had the privilege of leading some of the largest and highest returning investments in the company’s history,” he remembers. “From rolling out energy lighting across the estate through to implementing the largest multi-wreath array of PVs in Europe while pushing innovative tech such as the aerofoil shelf and photovoltaic sensor opaque thermal technologies. We also explored the increasing benefits of battery storage and smart opportunities with control systems linked to IoT to connect these technologies up and generate significant value.”

Crewe believes Anthesis are well place to help organisations with the culture shift towards implementing a sustainability strategy that goes beyond compliance with new technologies and tools like SCATTER (Setting City Area Targets and Trajectories for Emissions Reduction). Anthesis has been working with Greater Manchester Combined Authority and the Tyndall Centre (Manchester University) for over a year with funding from BEIS (the government department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy) to create a carbon and energy footprint, modelling and target tool. “Our internal team have developed the platform and a combination of in-house colleagues have provided expertise and guidance. In a nutshell it’s been a ground-breaking project to measure city-level emissions, model future scenarios, set reduction targets (in line with international standards) and deliver pathways to implement change.” It will be rolled-out to other UK core cities in the coming months and there are plans to create different versions of the tool, working alongside corporate entities and sectors.

Anthesis work in partnership with academia to evaluate and understand opportunities with emerging technologies like these and is also allied with a number of NGOs and non-profits, working closely with the likes of the Waste Resources Action Program to help support solutions for reducing waste across the UK and Europe. “We’re also a partner of the Consumer Goods Forum, an organisation set up to provide sustainable focus and intelligence insight for retailers and manufacturers across the globe,” adds Crewe, who is proud of the opportunities taken by Anthesis to provide thought leadership and guidance on food waste across the UK as part of its collaboration with the Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD).

Crewe is mindful of the obstacles to further progress and notes that the shifting sands of government legislation can often cause uncertainty when it comes to driving innovation and investment. Meanwhile, the spectre of Brexit has caused organisations to slow down until they have more certainty around what it will mean for their business. Crewe also notes the rate of change with technology has surpassed expectations in the last few years… “For example, with energy lighting the efficiency of the LED processors has improved incredibly. Sometimes organisations see that rate of change and then choose to wait for the next iteration, so it can almost become a challenge to tick that box and try something new.”

Awareness around sustainability has spiked. Thanks to TV shows like Blue Planet, plastics has become extremely topical. “We have a division dedicated to helping people across the world to plan, mitigate and do the right thing by their business when it comes to packaging and the use of plastics. During my time in retail it’s one of the biggest examples of the profile of an issue being raised, it’s such a positive trend and something we’re being asked to help on more and more,” says Crewe.

The recent IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) Special Report was strident about what climate change means for business. What are Crewe’s predictions for how this report will impact on the work Anthesis does? “The next ten years will be crucial to limit global temperature rise,” he says. “There’s a clear message: rapidly decarbonize the global economy to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Changing weather patterns will produce an impact through temperature change and rising sea levels. We have to start planning to mitigate and adapt to the IPCC report findings. It’s an area of importance not just for business to get right but for communities, cities and countries across the globe. The risks are real so we need to support our clients.”

Looking ahead, Crewe emphasises the need for Anthesis to continue to support its partners and their clients with their legislative ethos requirements to ensure they have up to date ethos assessments while helping to support energy reduction in their buildings allied to delivering good rates of return on their investment. “With new carbon reporting legislation (Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting – SECR) coming into effect in April 2019, we’re being asked more and more to help prepare our clients for disclosure on financial reporting on climate related matters.”

In helping companies achieve this type of goal Anthesis has been working with an international retailer which was aiming for ambitious energy and carbon reduction targets within their corporate sustainability strategy. Anthesis undertook investment grade audits to identify energy conservation measures (ECM), financial and non-financial benefits and payback periods. “We worked with the client team to build a business case for the implementation of key recommendations,” recalls Crewe. “The solution included technical insulation to reduce heat loss, gas usage and costs. We also project managed the installation across every UK site. In the end our ECM solution offered projected energy savings of 5.6 million kWh per year and an impressive payback period of just 1.8 years.”

Crewe believes working in partnerships is where Anthesis will continue to excel. Leaving the last word to clients like Cisco Systems shows how far the group has come and the trust they’ve earned: ""Anthesis have been excellent partners with their concentration on technical excellence and offering top client value. They are environmental experts, big enough to provide global services but small enough to provide the independence and agility that provides great results.""

73,Finnish households encouraged to recycle Christmas food waste in ‘Fat to Fuel’ campaign,"The campaign runs from now until January 7, with collection points being made available at K-Supermarkets and Neste petrol stations in towns and cities across Finland. The fat is then taken to a refinery where it is turned into renewable diesel fuel.

The organisation points out that the fat from an average-sized Christmas ham is enough to power a car for a three-kilometre journey. Given that approximately 7 million kilograms worth of ham is consumed in Finland every Christmas, the energy potential is significant.

This latest move follows a range of initiatives in Finland to establish a sustainable “circular economy”, many of which have gained significant attention in the national press.

74,Concerns Scotland is harming the environment as waste exported abroad,"CRITICS have raised concerns Scotland is harming the global environment and putting wildlife at risk after it emerged a record amount of waste has been exported outside its borders.

Figures show more than 1.5 million tonnes of rubbish left the country in 2016, up from 1.3 million in the previous year.

This includes 806,000 tonnes of waste which was sent to the rest of the UK, 680,956 tonnes which was exported to Europe and 70,653 which was sent further afield.

The export figures, published by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), make up 14.4 per cent of the total waste produced in Scotland for 2016, the last year for which information is available.

Scottish Conservative MSP Donald Cameron, who highlighted the statistics, said they represented a “major missed opportunity for Scotland”.

He added: “If the rest of the UK, the EU, and even far-flung parts of the world can deal with our waste, why can’t we?

“It could provide jobs and further recycling and energy-generating opportunities, and ensure we’re wholly responsible for the waste we produce as a country.

“All political parties need to get their heads together and find a way to improve this situation.

“It’s simply unsustainable to continue washing our hands of millions of tonnes of waste each year.

“And what’s more, when this waste is exported beyond the continent, there’s a fairly good chance it ends up in rivers and seas.

“With all we know about the damage that’s being caused to the environment right now, it’s incumbent on all parties in the Scottish Parliament to find a solution here.”

Figures show Scotland exported only 385,907 tonnes of rubbish in 2004. But just four years later, this had increased to more than a million tonnes.

And despite a drop in the overall waste produced from 11.6 million tonnes in 2015 to 10.79 million tonnes, the rate of exports has gone up.

Experts raised concerns some of the rubbish could end up in in the ocean, contributing to global pollution.

Malcolm Todd, former managing director of Shore Recycling, said: “These figures show that the amount of waste being exported from Scotland is increasing, as we fail to get to grips with a waste management crisis.

“Some of this waste might not be properly managed at its destination point and could, for example, end up in waterways in the far east, contributing to the plastic pollution problem we are trying to tackle across the globe.

“We can’t simply keep on sending our waste abroad, and must accelerate the building of a circular economy in Scotland.

“As well as driving up recycling rates, we must be diligent in what happens to the residual waste that stays in Scotland.

“This includes recognising the need for viable alternatives to landfill such as waste-to-energy plants which can treat the waste to generate heat and power for local communities.”

It comes after it emerged huge quantities of household rubbish continue to be dumped in Scottish landfill sites, with 1.13m tonnes buried in 2016.

Scotland has introduced a statutory ban on sending biodegradable municipal waste to landfill, which will come into effect in 2021.

Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said Scotland led the way in its ""ambitious and challenging recycling and landfill waste reduction targets, both of which are more ambitious than EU targets"".

She added: ""There is a legitimate global market for waste and recycling, but we are keen to see the development of recycling and reprocessing capability within Scotland.

“The development of our deposit return scheme is one way in which we are trying to boost the flow of high quality recyclable material to create a market for domestic reprocessing capability.”",United Kingdom,2018.12
78,Waste recycling infrastructure in a circular economy,"TOMRA Collection Solutions shows how a circular economy can be accomplished through adapting existing waste recycling infrastructure, viewing plastic as a valuable resource instead of waste.

There has been a seismic shift in public attitudes to waste and recycling recently and policymakers have been implementing ambitious targets and new regulation all over the world. The EU is no exception, having announced a series of new laws that will undoubtedly change the waste recycling infrastructure of EU Member States.

At the root of this new legislation is the circular economy and the EU’s desire to manage its own waste recycling infrastructure more effectively, further fuelled by restrictions put in place by countries that traditionally accepted the EU’s waste.

TOMRA Collection Solutions, the world leader in reverse vending, is present in more than 60 markets worldwide working to create a more circular economy. The Norwegian company collects 35 billion used beverage containers per year within deposit return schemes for closed loop recycling.

The EU currently recycles only about a quarter of the 25-26 million tonnes of plastic waste it produces annually, about half of which was sent to China. However, when China’s National Sword policy was introduced in February 2018, 24 types of waste material were banned and the purity level of accepted items greatly increased.

The world’s reliance on China as a depot for pre-sorted but dirty waste has been thrown into sharp focus, and with an influx of materials being diverted from China, other waste importing countries are following suit with restrictions. In August, Thailand banned the imports of plastic and electronic waste. Then, in October, Malaysia’s hugely strained recycling industry – which was inundated with 88,000 tonnes of the UK’s plastic scrap and 150,000 tonnes from the US – announced similar restrictions on plastics imports.

As countries close their borders to poor quality recyclables, Europe’s waste exporting countries are planning how they are going to manage the tidal wave of rubbish they traditionally exported and are looking inwards to improve their own waste recycling infrastructure.

Through the Circular Economy Package, EU Member States have signed up to a number of legislative proposals on waste, including a 75% target recycling rate on packaging waste by 2030. Additionally, in October, the European Commission announced that not only would plastic drinking bottles have to include a minimum of 35% recycled content by 2025, but also that Member States must collect and recycle 90% of these beverage containers.

In addition to China’s waste import ban, the catalyst for this legislation has been heightened awareness of an increasing environmental pollution crisis. Implementing these ambitious targets to streamline the waste recycling infrastructure will bring many benefits and by managing resources more efficiently, EU countries will create green jobs, manufacture higher quality products and deliver a more sustainable and circular model of production.

While many governments are realising that our industrial model is no longer sustainable and are increasingly willing to take action, a circular economy can seem like an intangible or distant goal.

But a circular economy would have wide-ranging benefits and can be introduced very practically, says TOMRA’s circular economy advisor, Kristine M. Berg: “The circular economy is all about the positive environmental impacts of keeping resources in closed loops. This includes the direct benefits of the waste recycling infrastructure such as reducing carbon emissions, but I would argue that it also covers much wider benefits of reducing demand for virgin materials and triggering improvements in consumer behaviour.”

Berg also highlights important distinctions in how climate and environment are understood with a circular economy perspective, both by government and consumers: “Circular economy mindset is a key solution when talking about environmental issues such as marine litter, because in a sense you eliminate the idea of ‘waste’. Everything is a resource. Materials are ideally designed for recycling, for a second, third, fourth lifecycle – and are collected and recycled accordingly to maintain material quality. This is true for glass bottles, metal cans and plastic bottles, for example.

“But not all of these perform equally well if we talk about climate on top of this. Plenty of other materials can be recycled to a high quality over and over again – but collection and recycling can be very energy intensive. Although much harm can come from plastic materials when they go astray and end up in the environment, plastic outperforms most other materials in terms of climate gains or benefits in the waste recycling infrastructure. Furthermore, plastic can’t be easily replaced in terms of medical equipment, transport, or food and water safety. Plastic isn’t the enemy, our single-use behaviour is.

“Waste management systems are extremely complex and value chains can be very intricate. Co-operation and transparency are key; when thinking about the execution of EU-wide regulation there needs to be thoughtful implementation.”

With increasing awareness over the impact plastic has on the environment, regulators have an important role to play in maintaining the reputation of the material. Plastic is the workhorse material of today’s economy and, for manufacturers, it brings unrivalled functionality at low cost.

However, there are signs that European legislators are considering reclassifying plastic as ‘hazardous waste’, following a proposal discussed at the Basel Convention in September. While the intentions behind the recommendation may be good, TOMRA suggests that restrictive policies would make the waste recycling infrastructure and thus recycled products more expensive and complicated.

Head of TOMRA Collection Solutions, Harald Henriksen, says: “With advanced sensor-based sorting technology available, there is no need to burn plastic waste for energy recovery instead of recycling it into new products. In fact, this is the very definition of a linear economy, and what legislators are trying to overcome.

“Taking a waste-to-energy approach doesn’t encourage better product design and consumer behaviour. Worst of all, burning plastic means that we need to pump up more oil for more products, when we have already produced 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic since the 1950s.”

For Henriksen, the EU’s focus for a circular economy should be on reducing demand for, and reliance on, virgin plastic.

From waste to value

Central to the vision of a circular economy shared by policymakers, industry and technology providers like TOMRA, is the reimagining of plastic as a valuable resource within the waste recycling infrastructure.

Henriksen continues: “We need to stop viewing plastic as waste, and instead treat it as a resource – and an opportunity. The linear economy model of ‘take, make, dispose’ has been accelerating for the past 40 years. At its heart is a culture of waste, viewing products as disposable, with little regard for what becomes of them once discarded. In a circular economy it is possible to collect and recycle without impacting on the product’s quality, so that products can be used again and again in a never-ending closed loop.”

Henriksen suggests that rather than demonising plastic as a pollutant, the EU has adopted the right focus in setting circular economy targets, such as limiting the use of virgin plastic and incentivising improvements in waste recycling infrastructure.

“These are very positive steps and the momentum is all heading towards a more circular economy,” Henriksen continues, “but the important question is, who is ready?”

While overall the EU managed to recycle 67% of packaging in 2016, that was led by strong performers such as Belgium and Denmark, who recycle around 80%. The reality is that Hungary, Croatia, Estonia and Latvia struggle to recycle 50% of their packaging, according to Eurostat data.

Introducing a deposit return scheme (DRS) is the most effective way for EU Member States to meet new waste recycling infrastructure targets, for example achieving a 90% collection rate on single-use plastic drinks bottles ahead of the 2025 deadline, according to TOMRA.

These see consumers pay a deposit of up to €0.25 on plastic, aluminium and glass containers, which is then refunded when the bottle or can is returned for recycling. Eight EU nations now have a deposit return system (DRS), with Germany leading the way at a 98% return rate. TOMRA’s innovative ‘reverse vending’ machines – which enable automated collection – are also used in Lithuania, where a DRS implemented in 2016 saw recycling rates soar from 34% up to 92% within two years.

DRS schemes achieve up to 40% higher collection rates for plastic, aluminium and glass beverage containers than other methods incorporated in the waste recycling infrastructure and there are two main reasons for this:

Financial incentive – providing consumers with a financial incentive not only motivates them to dispose of their container in the correct place, it also communicates that the container has a value, that it is not rubbish and should be treated as a resource. In fact, deposits reduce beverage litter by up to 80%.

Increased purity – by separating bottles and cans for recycling through reverse vending machines – drink containers are collected without contamination from other types of waste in a household recycling bin and can maintain a high level of quality, suitable for turning back into a bottle, rather than being downcycled for lower quality applications.

This is a process known as closed-loop recycling, which TOMRA calls the Clean Loop. This reduces both reliance on the raw materials needed to produce new beverage containers (that is, coming into the loop) and waste ending up in landfills or in nature as litter (going out of the loop).

Furthermore, a DRS works exceptionally well when policymakers and manufacturers work together to ensure that products are designed with waste recycling infrastructure in mind. Around 80% of a product’s environmental impact is determined at the design stage, so manufacturers should transform the way products are designed and produced, especially those made with mixed plastics that are extremely difficult or impossible to recycle.

EU Member States will have a challenge on their hands over the next couple of years to meet these new ambitious targets, however with good collaboration between manufacturers, policy makers and consumers the targets are very achievable.

A circular economy can be a result of this collaboration: having the right waste recycling infrastructure in place to not only achieve high collection rates, but also maintaining a high level of purity on the material collected, will ensure a bottle can be reincarnated again and again, keeping litter out of the world’s oceans, streets and landfills.",European Union,2018.12
88,Eight-party task force outlines future climate goals for Finland,"The Finns Party abandoned the task force last week, saying the goals discussed by the other parties were too ambitious.

The remaining eight parties stated last week that both Finland and the European Union should reform their climate policies in order to ensure they can do their part in limiting global warming to 1.5ºC above pre-industrial levels.

“The EU should design its long-term climate actions in a way that it achieves carbon-neutrality before 2050,” the joint statement reads.

The parties acknowledged that achieving carbon-neutrality by the midway point of the century will necessitate that the emissions reduction target for 2030 is raised from the current 40 per cent to at least 55 per cent compared to the levels of 1990. The EU, they added, should also globally promote carbon pricing, carbon footprint calculation and the implementation of the Paris Agreement.

“As the entire world moves toward carbon-neutrality, an ambitious climate policy will also support the competitiveness of European industries,” they highlighted.

Emissions trading scheme must be developed further

Another crucial aspect is developing emissions trading within the EU, according to the eight parties.

The union should place further emphasis on the emissions trading scheme in adopting stricter reduction targets to ensure energy and industrial production proceed toward carbon-neutrality across member states.

Finland, they pledged, will contribute actively to the development of the emissions trading scheme in a way that the pricing of emissions rights encourages cutting emissions efficiently and rapidly while nurturing the competitiveness of European industries.

“The number of emissions rights entering the market annually must be reduced clearly more than the current 2.2 per cent a year, unused emissions rights must be annulled and the emissions trading scheme must be expanded to cover, for example, building-specific cooling and heating,” they outlined.

“The coverage of the emissions trading scheme for aviation must additionally be expanded.”

Finland, meanwhile, should adopt stricter national emissions reduction targets and take action to ensure its carbon sinks more than offset its greenhouse gas emissions no later than in the 2040s. The country should additionally draft a comprehensive carbon sink policy for the land-use sector.

“We will grow Finland’s carbon sinks on a long-term basis by promoting forest growth, launching a major reforestation programme, mitigating deforestation strongly, reducing emissions produced by peat lands and developing carbon capture in agriculture,” the parties pledged.

They also declared that heat and electricity production in the country should be almost emissions free by the end of the 2030s.

Budgeting for sustainable development should be made more efficient by introducing climate resilience assessments into fiscal planning. A larger share of development policy funds, meanwhile, should be allocated for efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to climate change and foster carbon sinks.

Both Finland and the EU should additionally step up investment in research, development and innovation activities.

The task force also outlined that the country should promote not only low-emission and emissions-free transport, but also the circular economy and sustainable consumption and production by developing how product carbon footprints are calculated and accounted for.

The task force consisted of representatives of the Blue Reform, Centre Party, Christian Democrats, Green League, Left Alliance, National Coalition, Social Democrats and Swedish People’s Party.",Finland,2018.12

103,National recognition for Welsh firm recycling value into the NHS,"The Cardiff-based Thermal Compaction Group (TCG) has been Highly Commended for its work with a health trust in England after pioneering the recycling of medical waste wrap material to generate income for the NHS.

TCG’s collaboration with the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS Foundation Trust was Highly Commended for both the Estates & Facilities and Environmental Practice trophies at last week’s Health Business Awards in London, just weeks after the partnership won the Healthcare Estates Sustainable Achievement accolade.

Single-use sterilisation wraps, used for surgical instruments in millions of operations in hospitals across the UK every year, and polypropylene patient transfer sheets create a large amount of bulky waste which goes for incineration or landfill nationwide. TCG is able to remove the materials from the waste stream, avoiding incineration, reducing the cost of transport, and creating value by returning it to the UK supply chain for use in new products – and now healthcare providers worldwide in countries as far afield as South Africa are adopting the technology.

Chief Operating Officer at TCG is entrepreneur Thomas Davison-Sebry who said:

“Being recognised nationally for our partnerships with the NHS is terrific and raises the profile of this exciting and innovative technology which can bring such benefits to healthcare providers in the UK and across the world, addressing global waste management problems and contributing to the circular economy. In one easy operation, we can take the wrap as waste, reduce its volume substantially, render it inert and then re-introduce it to the supply chain, removing high incineration costs and creating revenues for a health service under persistent pressures.”

TCG employs globally pioneering and patented Sterimelt technology to offer a sustainable solution for the disposal of the single use plastic healthcare materials, using machines to heat the wraps at approximately 320°c to create inert, sterilised, briquettes which can be sold on to produce the likes of garden furniture, fences, buckets, plant pots, ropes and chairs.

The company and its Welsh NHS partner, Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, had support from the Bevan Commission, tasked by the Welsh Government to help SMEs make health services improvements in Wales. The technology was successfully trialled at St Woolos Hospital, Newport, part of the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board.

TCG is also working with Styromelt technology to recycle polystyrene.",United Kingdom,2018.12
108,'Fast fashion' in the firing line,"IT is the latest form in convenience shopping - clothes so cheap they can be worn only once and then discarded without impacting on household budgets.

Fast fashion has become a byword in the industry for sparkly dresses, smart shirts and t-shirts which sell for buttons up and down the high street.

Yet now there is a growing weight of evidence the prevalence of clothing so cheap it can be easily disposed of is harming the environment - and adding to the dangers of global warming.

And experts and campaigners are warning shoppers not to add to the pile as Scotland gets into the swing of the party season and the rush of last-minute Christmas gift-giving.

Recent research on the textile industry has found that it accounts for 8 per cent - 1.2bn tonnes - of global greenhouse gas emissions.

READ MORE: Fast-fashion can be just as durable as designer brands, says academic

The UK play a large part in this, consuming almost 27kg of new clothing per head per year compared to only 9 kg in France.

Global clothing production has doubled since 2000, and it takes 700 gallons of water to make 1 t shirt, the equivalent of 3 years’ drinking water for your average person.

Politicians are now urging people to think of more sustainable options for their wardrobes, to help cut down on waste.

Labour's Environment spokesperson Claudia Beamish said: “The festive season is the time to get your glad rags on and you may look to fashion for presents for loved ones.

“Many of us are used to being mindful about recycling Christmas cards and wrapping paper – but we are more blasé about fast fashion and textile waste. But we should all consider more sustainable options when planning partywear and gifts this winter.

“Scottish Labour has set the ambitious target for Scotland of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and a shift to a more circular economy will be an important step.""

She said that around 95 per cent of the clothes that are thrown away could be recycled or reused and highlighted the work of the ‘Miixer’ Zero Waste Hub in Dunbar, East Lothian, which diverts more than 30 tonnes of material from landfill every month to reuse for community benefit through donations to charities and its shop.

Susan Guy, a Director of Miixer CIC, said: “Miixer CIC’s ‘Big Pick’ initiatives aim to alleviate local clothing poverty, create jobs and significantly reduce CO2 emissions by keeping textile waste local. Our waste is our resource.”

Last month, U.K. lawmakers wrote to the heads of online retailers including Amazon.com Inc. and Asos to seek evidence about the environmental and social impacts of selling cheap clothes.

Fashion designer Stella McCartney has also criticised the trend, saying that people needed to be more aware of the impact the clothing industry has on the planet.

She said: “People wear, on average, fast fashion about three times before it’s thrown away. We need to educate.

“Big industry leaders have a much bigger impact than I do. Business leaders have to man-up.”

At Westminster the Commons environmental audit committee (EAC) has been examining the impact of clothes production, especially those items produced cheaply and quickly.

Last month Labour MP Mary Creagh, chair of the committee, grilled representatives at fashion retailers, asking Primark's head of ethical trade and environmental sustainability Paul Lister on how the firm can justify selling T-shirts for as little as £2 or £3.

Mr Lister said: ""Primark has never done any significant advertising at all, and that can save us in any year £100m to £150m, compared to some of our larger rivals. That goes straight into price. That keeps our pricing low.""

""It's our business model that takes us to a £2 T-shirt.""

Carol Kane, joint CEO of online fashion house Boohoo, said a small number of dresses intentionally sold at a loss, to drive more traffic to the site.

Ms Kane, asked if consumers were now too accustomed to cheap, disposable clothes, said: ""I believe this all comes back to consumer demand. I've been in the industry for 32 years, and in that time I've seen prices decline.""

Jamie Beck, from the Arcadia group, which includes Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Burton, said that people should not throw away clothes which can still be used, adding: ""These garments aren't designed to be a disposable item, to be bought for [just] a holiday. They're designed to be long-lasting.""",United Kingdom,2018.12

115,Directive fails to ackknowledge potential of biodegradable plastics,"“This directive is a valuable initiative to raise awareness for consumption patterns and tackle marine pollution”, says François de Bie, Chairman of EUBP. “However, it is necessary to combine ambition and proportionality within the directive – so that unnecessary single-use plastics are avoided, while provisions for the circular economy and the EU’s internal market are safeguarded. Biodegradable certified compostable plastics fulfil Europe’s requirements for health and safety and can be recycled organically together with food waste”.

The priority should be the use of multi-use option where feasible. However, EUBP considers a general restriction of single-use cutlery and plates an excessive move that will create negative consequences in contexts where EU legislation for hygiene and food contact need to be fulfilled, but where no multi-use options can be deployed. “When implementing the irective, Member States should envisage the possibility to create limited, efficient exemptions for innovative compostable plastic products that facilitate organic recycling”, says de Bie. As boosting organic recycling is a major pillar of the European circular economy, such considerations would support the European Commission’s commitment towards a sustainable circular bioeconomy while safeguarding the investments and the jobs created by the European bioplastics industry.

On a different note, EUBP fully supports the European institutions’ decision to restrict the use of oxo-degradable plastics. Significant evidence suggests oxo-degradable plastics merely fragment into small pieces, contributing to microplastics pollution. In order to ensure the use of biodegradable plastics in the context of a strong European circular economy, it is important to clearly define the difference between oxo-degradable and biodegradable plastics. The directive at hand, therefore, needs to provide unambiguous definitions.

EUBP looks forward to discussing the use of bio-based feedstock for the production of plastics as well as the benefits biodegradable plastics can offer in a circular economy context with the European institutions and Member States in 2019.",Germany,2018.12
117,TOMRA tackles global waste with sensor-based sorting solutions,"Our planet is facing a waste crisis: more than eight million tonnes of plastic enters our oceans every year; fewer than half of all plastic bottles are collected for recycling; and one third of all food produced globally is never eaten. You don’t have to be a mathematician to know that our industrial model is not sustainable, and that unprecedented action is required to stop us from destroying the planet. In essence, we need a paradigm shift in the way we produce and consume fresh food and goods.

Many of us in the recycling industry are convinced a resource revolution is already taking place, and that a circular economy will soon become a reality. Action is no longer just for activists: technology innovators are showing companies how to gain value from waste through a powerful combination of expert knowledge and cutting-edge solutions, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.

It’s through these clever applications – which help to unlock the full potential of local and global farmland, as well as make cities smarter and more sustainable – that TOMRA and other ambitious companies are leading the transformation towards a circular economy.

Wasted opportunities

 A key area for change lies in plastics. Our use of plastic has increased 20-fold over the past 50 years, and it’s expected to double again in the next two decades. For manufacturers, plastic brings unrivalled functional properties at a low cost. Indeed, there is nothing inherently wrong with the material itself, but it does have a disastrous effect on the environment when it’s not collected and recycled effectively.

But managing plastic more sustainably doesn’t have to be arduous. In fact, a burgeoning economy is emerging from the process of recovering, washing and sorting plastic taken out of waste streams. What’s more, innovative sensor-based technologies – like the reverse vending machines (RVMs) developed by TOMRA in 1972 – are making this collection process a convenient part of everyday life.

Today, the use of RVMs at supermarkets allows people to deposit their empty beverage containers for a small refund, driving huge increases in recycling rates – up to 98 percent, in some cases. TOMRA itself captures 35 billion used beverage containers every year, representing 2.5 percent of the total sold in 2017. Clearly, there is still much more to be done.

By collecting a greater volume of plastic packaging materials, it is estimated that we can introduce around $100bn (€86.3bn) of value back into the global economy. To achieve this, TOMRA provides pioneering, sensor-based sorting solutions to the waste and metal recycling industries, recovering many types of valuable materials from the waste stream and sorting them efficiently. In other words, we literally turn waste into value.

Manufacturers and brand owners can also benefit from making new products out of recycled plastics. Consumer packaged goods account for around 40 percent of plastic use, so it is reassuring to see some of the world’s largest brands committing to the use of recycled raw materials. Naturally, the market wants recycled material that is of a high enough quality to be reused; if this is achieved, virgin material could be replaced entirely.

Fortunately, brand owners are already working with technology companies on lighthouse projects that replace virgin plastics with 100 percent recyclates. This includes redesigning products – around 80 percent of a product’s environmental impact is determined at the design stage – and developing ‘closed loop’ recycling for plastic materials.

Trash talk

 The accelerated sustainability movement is being supported by both consumer demand and legislation. The European Commission has set new targets for member states to recycle around 70 percent of packaging waste by 2030. Some countries are far off these goals and don’t have the necessary infrastructure in place, so it will take significant investment, as well as collaboration with technology innovators that are working hard to reshape the industry.

Restrictive policies such as China’s National Sword initiative – which was introduced in February and bans the import of 24 types of waste material, as well as greatly increases the required purity level of accepted items – are also having a major impact. The world’s reliance on China as a dumping ground for pre-sorted (but dirty) waste has been thrown into sharp focus. Consequently, countries in Europe and North America are sitting on a lot of plastic, realising they must invest in their domestic waste management capabilities.

At the same time, consumers are demanding that products be made responsibly, and have placed a greater emphasis on the environmental, social and ethical practices of brand owners. Both of these factors are motivating companies to change their processes and products.

Food for thought

 Resources go beyond plastics, however, and another key area in which technology is acting as a catalyst for change is the food industry. Imagine if we could reduce vast amounts of food waste by making sure every product is grown, harvested, handled and stored more efficiently. Ambitious companies like TOMRA are transforming the global food supply chain by using sensor-based technology to increase yields and perform sophisticated food analysis and grading.

This technology can be applied to fresh foods, including fruit, vegetables and nuts, which must be carefully treated to avoid perishing, as well as to processed foods such as French fries, which must meet consumer expectations every time. Through automation, thousands of items can be sorted every minute, providing huge commercial benefits to food producers.

Sensor technologies can also tell producers how ripe an apple is, how long it can be stored and, as a result, where and when it should be delivered to consumers. The same technology means that retailers may be able to guarantee an apple’s sweetness, raising its market value. Essentially, the art of farming has become a science.

But the use of technologies such as automation, blockchain, AI and machine learning goes far beyond producing the perfect apple. According to the UN, the global population could reach 9.8 billion people by 2050, a feat that would require approximately 70 percent more food to be produced than is consumed today. With urban populations growing, the chance of increasing farmland proportionately appears slim.

What’s more, consumers are more empowered than ever: they demand not only fresh, local and healthy food, but also variety, traceability and year-round supply. This is making the food supply chain even larger and more complex, highlighting the importance of automation to the market of the future.

Fortunately, traditional producers are already making moves in this area. In precision agriculture, for example, sensors attached to plants are measuring the levels of irrigation and fertiliser required for each crop, increasing yields by some 30 percent. ‘Agritech’ – such as mechanical harvesters and sorters – is also helping farmers overcome labour shortages, while fresh-food processors are benefitting from having several stages of automated quality control before distribution, protecting their clients and their reputations.

New technologies have already shown numerous industries that it is possible to create economic value in a way that also benefits society. TOMRA’s vision of ‘leading the resource revolution’ strongly reflects this: its technology is helping businesses capitalise on long-term trends, such as the circular economy and the future of food.

By transitioning from the role of supplier to critical partner, TOMRA is forging strategic relationships and making selected investments that will help to meet the industry’s future demands. Whether relating to recycling or the food industry – or many other sectors, for that matter – these technologies provide invaluable benefits to consumers, businesses and the environment alike.",United Kingdom,2018.12
118,How packaging design impacts Christmas recycling behaviour,"Packaging design has an impact on whether consumers keep up Christmas recycling according to a new study.

The study was conducted by researchers at CTF, Service Research Center at Karlstad University, Sweden and assesses how packaging design influences consumer behaviour in terms of Christmas recycling.

How does packaging design influence the user?

Helén Williams, Lecturer in Environmental and Energy Systems, who led this study, said: “If the package consists of several different materials that have to be separated, or need to be rinsed, the handling time and hence the resistance to sorting increases. Uncertainty about how to clean or sort the packaging also plays a role. One example is the plastic lid on the milk carton packaging. Should the lid stay on the packaging or should the entire plastic part be torn off?”.

Many of the study’s participants stated that they were concerned about sabotaging the system for the recycled materials. This mean that they chose to throw the packaging in the normal waste bin when they were unsure.

Williams explained the motivation for conducting the study: “We wanted to investigate what packaging characteristics make motivated consumers throw the packaging in the waste. If motivated consumers experience such major obstacles to certain packaging, it can be expected that even more packaging will be discarded if less motivated. The consumers’ willingness to sort is crucial for an improvement.”

Williams added: “Although our results need to be verified in a larger study, our pilot study provides many ideas on how packaging designs should be developed to make it easier to sort. In order to reach the ambitions of the EU’s Circular Economy Strategy, the industry needs to understand how packaging design can help consumers to sort. If the questions are handled with the correct insight into materials, technology and consumer behaviour, Sweden can lead the development of knowledge that globally can contribute to reducing plastic waste in the oceans.”",European Union,2018.12
121,Des King | A Christmas wish: consumers doing their circular economy duty,"I’m an incurable nostalgia junkie. The Museum of Brands is my spiritual home; actually, I could be eligible as an exhibit myself. Just now is a particularly fruitful time of the year for mining rich pickings from days of yore. Not always totally authentic if truth be told, but who’d begrudge a sprinkling of journalistic license if it paints every Christmas past snow white, and repeatedly doles out a shiny sixpence in each helping of plum pudding. So, hey-ho (ho ho), it’s never too late to have a happy childhood. Wouldn’t you agree, Tiny Tim?

One bygone from the past that I recall with unvarnished clarity but had imagined to be irrevocably out of date is getting money back on the empties. Should this practice be re-introduced (under the more official sounding guise as the DRS: deposit return scheme) it’ll be directed towards recovering some of the estimated 700,000 PET bottles littered each day. Ironic really: it was the adoption of plastic in the 1980s that led to the previous custom being discontinued.

The supporters of DRS are banking upon its ability to engage consumers as the last crucial link in the supply chain in fuelling the furtherance of the circular economy; in which their participation hitherto has been decidedly unreliable. It’s a laudable enough aspiration, and with the sepulchral forebodings of you know who still reverberating it’s one that’s worth pursuing. Plus it’s a recycling mechanism that’s been shown to work in other countries; for example, Germany where all bar 3% of non-reusable bottles are studiously returned.

The unvoiced stumbling-block in terms of soliciting the proactive engagement of consumers in the recycling process, however, is they’re being expected to make something out of nothing for someone else. So if the general public’s green appetite can be stimulated by the prospect of a couple of bob a pop or whatever, then all well and good.

But as is often the case: beware the spectre of unintended consequences; notably, the potentially adverse impact of a DRS habit on kerbside behaviour. Limit it to PET bottles, and suppliers of alternative substrates could justifiably protest that they stand to lose market share should consumers be more attracted to a format with cash-back prospects. Remove the waste packaging that has value from the regular bin collection – whether that’s rigid plastics, glass, metal or board – and local authorities may well lose interest in picking up the remaining scraps not worth their while. As Lord Deben pointed out at Packaging Innovations, no other country operating our kind of widespread kerbside collection system has ever introduced a DRS scheme. Maybe there’s a reason for that?

It also might undermine the viability of that other has-been from a less wasteful era: the water fountain. But even so, if it encourages the general public to get Blue Peter about Blue Planet what’s not to like. So get stockpiling those empties. Although Christmas present might not see DRS abroad in the land, by Christmas future there’s every likelihood we’ll be merrily singing “weer all reecyclers now.” In the meantime: bless us, every one.

125,Green technologies gearing up globally in East and West,"The EU has been a pioneer in green technologies for decades, but China is rapidly catching up in eco-innovation, explains Prof Dr Raimund Bleischwitz

The EU has been a proud pioneer in green technologies since the 1970s. International milestones such as the Paris Agreement on Climate Change signed in 2015 confirm leadership and ambitions. Yet, the EU has recently been crippled following concerns over migration and struggles with the state of the union itself – absorbed by managing Brexit and sweeping populism. As a result, the EU’s pioneering spirit in environmental action seems to vanish, and forces of fragmentation appear stronger than attempts for integration. So, what’s the evidence of green shifts and what trends may come up?

One needs to look at the wider picture of societal transitions to grasp the fundamental uncertainties and the ubiquitous ‘age of anger’ (Mishra Pankaj). Others call it a ‘productivity puzzle’ – a quest for the wellsprings of prosperity. For decades, if not centuries, labour has been the main driving force. The engine of growth based on labour has been stuttering in many countries, and the future challenges of Industry 4.0 – name it digitalisation and artificial intelligence – is likely to accelerate crisis.

The troubled state of the environment with tonnes of plastics polluting oceans and sea animals, historic droughts and other extreme weather events, call for a restart in efforts to think through productivity and prosperity. For a turnaround, societies will need to reconsider productivity and move towards a circular economy (CE), one that creates public values through unleashing resource productivity. Fortunately, the Europeans are not alone any longer.

The hubs of innovation and change are shifting eastwards. China, Japan and South Korea have strong national strategies for enabling a circular economy and low carbon societies. After more than 15 years of being a frontrunner, the new Chinese policies enacted in 2017 introduce product redesign and the sharing economy, with value creation opportunities particularly for cities. Large-scale industrial parks such as Liuzhou and Kawasaki in Japan demonstrate radical emission reductions and cost savings through principles of industrial ecology and cascading energy use. New lighthouse projects such as Lingang City and its Low Carbon College, located close to Shanghai Disneyland to attract millions of visitors in the future, start to act as living laboratories for the next great transformation – towards a circular economy.

Collaboration across movers and scalers, not confrontation

Geography and scale matter, as much as new modes of collaboration. The idea of a ‘first mover’ is often associated with a personality or a firm unleashing a Schumpeterian dynamic of overcoming barriers towards becoming a champion; national systems of innovation would underpin such efforts. The innovation systems of the 21st century may look different. The new normal cuts across nation states. International collaborations may well be embedded in regional action across multiple stakeholders to test and integrate novel products into systems of provision – the electric vehicles in Chinese cities being a splendid example.

Yet, such case also demonstrates how transformation spreads from developing key technologies and testing new systems towards ‘first scalers’ in mass markets: green transitions are spanning continents and involve producers, consumers, and governments. China now constitutes 60% of all new electric cars in the world, and some observers expect a ban for gasoline cars as early as in 2022 – quite a disruptive shift and a nudge for Europeans as well as for industries to stay alert as second movers. Mission-oriented policies (Mariana Mazzucato) ought to be developed. Imagine a mobility being independent of oil in the year 2030, what a different world it would be.

No doubt, there will be winners and losers. However, the savings on purchasing and processing costs for energy, materials and water as well as on total costs to access are enormous, compared to returns on old-fashioned investments and linear business models. Estimates done by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation count such savings equivalent to around 14% and 16% of China’s projected GDP in 2030 and 2040, which altogether could enable more Chinese urban dwellers to enjoy a middle-class lifestyle with low environmental impacts. European findings give evidence for double-digit cost savings in manufacturing outweighing efforts in change and enabling investments into new products and services to the benefit of the people.

Key enablers are within the built environment and access to affordable housing, mobility and food, hence in line with key SDGs. New collaborations can bring along new and refurbished buildings following a modular and multi-functional design, with components being ready for reuse and digitally enabled sharing models. In energy, food and water, cities could become regenerative and recover nutrients for urban farming. Universities, labelled as ‘one of the greatest institutional inventions of the past millennium’ (Andy Haldane) have a particular role to play as providers of knowledge and social skills as well as facilitators for life-long learning across cultures. Blending traditional silos of knowledge and skills with grand challenges, novel solutions and upscaling them will be key in going beyond CO2 reduction towards addressing resource interlinkages (the ‘nexus’) in a more holistic manner towards a circular economy and systemic eco-innovation.

The China – EU agreement on a circular economy signed in 2018 has been a useful step in the right direction; we propose six actions for the way ahead:

1) Collaborations among cities and industrial parks, to include low carbon energy systems, circular buildings with recovery options for materials, shared zero-emission vehicles, and urban nexus innovations such as Alibaba’s JuTuDi and working with circular economy utilities such as Veolia.

2) Ambitious CE standards for key product groups in construction, mobility and food that enhance affordability and sharing.

3) A regional Platform for information and better policy, combined with an action clearinghouse on CE initiatives, technology, and know-how transfer in order to practice what is preached.

4) Redesigning the ‘one belt, one road’ initiative towards a green EurAsia platform, with extended producer responsibility schemes, green supply chains, and creative solutions for the fossil fuel economies of Central Asia and for eco-innovations in Eastern Europe.

5) Coordinated market-based incentives towards removing harmful subsidies, transforming the ‘zombie industries’ of cement and steel, and unleashing investments into CE and public values.

6) A Foresight Commission assessing pathways and options towards 2030 and beyond, with scenarios and modelling interacting with planning and stakeholders.

The years ahead will look brighter if opportunities of collaborations are being grasped and if people realise they benefit from tangible innovations on the ground and participate in change rather than feeling left behind.

137,Recycling Technologies | Project Lodestar Models A Pathway To Recycle 'All Plastic' Waste In An Advanced Plastics Reprocessing Facility,"UK Government allocating funding to Tay Cities to invest up to £5.2m in an advanced plastic reprocessing facility

Swindon, UK. Wednesday 19th December 2018 – Recycling Technologies, on behalf of the project’s partners, today announces the publication of the results of Project Lodestar. This case study shows the potential for waste site operators to recycle ‘all plastics’ by combining state-of-the-art mechanical and feedstock recycling in an advanced Plastics Reprocessing Facility.

Lodestar is a Pioneer Project initiated and run by participant organisations of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s New Plastics Economy initiative. Project Lodestar was led by Recycling Technologies, joining forces with leading global stakeholders, including petrochemical companies and consumer brand companies. Partners from across the plastic value chain collaborated on researching and designing a blue-print for an advanced Plastics Reprocessing Facility (aPRF) utilising mechanical and feedstock recycling in a single combined facility. The participant group consisted of representatives from Borealis, Coca-Cola, EcoldeaM, ExcelRise, Danone, Impact Solutions, Mars, NexTek, The Canadian Stewardship Services Alliance, NatureWorks, Re-Poly, Swire Beverages, Recycling Technologies, Unilever and Zero Waste Scotland.

The Scottish and UK Government announced on 22 November 2018 a £300m investment in the Tay Cities region which included a commitment to invest up to £5.2m, following agreement on a robust business case, to support the development of a two-phase project to build the world’s first aPRF in the Tay Cities Region. Phase 1 will be the development of the world’s first demonstration aPRF (project Beacon), a major integrated waste facility in Tayside, and Phase 2 will be the development of a next generation advanced plastic sorting facility as a global blueprint for best in class recycling to recycle 90%+ of all household plastics.

Using commercial market prices and published waste data from Scotland, Lodestar modelled an aPRF where residual plastic waste rejects from advanced mechanical recycling are sent to innovative feedstock recycling and diverted from incineration, increasing significantly plastic recycling rates. The feedstock recycling converts the residual plastic waste into an oil suitable to remanufacture into plastic or other chemical feedstocks, allowing plastics to be kept in the circular economy.

Significantly, the research found that, compared to mechanical recycling alone, an aPRF has the potential to increase waste operators’ revenue by 25% and improve the payback on investment in the facility’s equipment by 11%. This level of performance could be further enhanced by improving packaging design and the elimination of PVC in packaging.

Finally for residential households and local authorities, the research highlighted how the volume of plastics collected can be increased by making collection systems more convenient and allowing residents to put all their waste plastics into one bin – ‘if you think it’s plastics, put it in’ - as an aPRF is able to sort all the plastic material at a single site.

Adrian Griffiths, Chief Executive of Recycling Technologies, said: 

“The Lodestar project shows the commercial and environmental value of combining state-of-the-art mechanical and feedstock recycling. It shows waste plastic has significant commercial and citizenship value for recycling companies, local government and packaging companies. Lodestar provides a valuable reference and guide to help waste businesses and governments meet their targets to recycle plastic to reuse again in packaging made out of recycled plastic and help prevent waste plastic damaging the environment.”

The results from Lodestar are helping to guide and develop Project Beacon, in Scotland, working with Zero Waste Scotland (ZWS), the Scottish Government’s delivery body on resource efficiency. In its initial phase, Project Beacon is combining Recycling Technologies’ first commercial RT7000 plant with mechanical processing for large rigids provided by Pi-Polymers. Planning permission has been granted for the initial phase at Binn Ecopark in Perthshire.

Rachel Goldstein, Global Sustainability Senior Manager at Mars Incorporated, Lodestar partner said: 

“Mars is committed to making our packaging recyclable. Project Lodestar has brought multiple industries together in a collaborative effort to design a blueprint for a recycling facility that combines the best of existing technologies and new technologies to make all plastics recyclable. This is exactly the kind of ambition we are working to advance as a core partner of the New Plastic Economy.”

Gavin Warner, Director Sustainable Business, Unilever said:

“Project Lodestar is an excellent demonstration of industry-wide collaboration to prevent plastic leakage. The fact that a facility is now being built in Scotland is testimony to this. We hope to see a time when all the outputs from such a facility can be remanufactured and used to close the loop on plastic.”

John Ferguson, Managing Director at Eco ideaM, said: 

“Lodestar supports the foundations for Project Beacon in Scotland, where best in class mechanical and chemical plastic recycling technologies will sit side by side to accelerate the process of halting the unnecessary leakage of waste plastic into the environment by significantly increasing its ability to be recycled successfully. It is particularly encouraging that this project has also just gained the offer of £5.2m support from the Tay Cities Deal to develop the advanced plastics sorting facility concept as Phase 2 of Project Beacon.""

Iain Gulland, Chief Executive, Zero Waste Scotland said: 

“Project Beacon has the potential to be a truly ground-breaking step forward in the battle to reduce plastic waste, not just for Scotland but globally. Aside from the clear environmental benefits, it would also simplify recycling for householders and create significant business opportunities in the circular economy. We're delighted to be able to support this pioneering work and hope the research published today will drive further business innovation.”

138,Hull University to develop biodegradable plastic,"Scientists at the University of Hull are developing a new biodegradable plastic as part of a £1.1m project investigating plastics in the economy and environment.

A team of over 25 academics from the University will work with a wide range of companies and other organisations to investigate how these new plastics, along with new ways of recovering and recycling plastics, can be adopted.

The project will use staff and students at the University as a test-bed for public attitudes to new plastics and will consider the potential social and environmental impacts of the material.

The research will include a significant number of non-academic organisations, including business, supermarkets, local government and recycling companies.

Along with University experts, they will be contributing to a new understanding of how the plastics circular economy works today, and helping explore new ideas and solutions.

Professor Carl Redshaw, who is co-leading the project, is an expert in chemistry and catalyst design for biodegradable polymers, will work on developing a new range of biodegradable plastics.

He said: ‘The scale of plastic waste in the environment and the resilience of the fossil-derived polymers used for its creation are unsustainable.

‘Current levels of reliance on the use of plastics make this a significant challenge both in terms of needing specific breakthroughs in materials and chemical engineering, alongside the need to change behaviours necessary to move beyond single-use fossil-derived disposable plastics. It takes 400 years for a plastic bag to degrade in a UK landfill.

As part of the project, chemical engineers from the University will also look at the development of commercially viable reprocessing methods for depolymerisation and regeneration of useful chemicals derived from post-use plastic waste, which can be used in new consumer plastics.

Dr Pauline Deutz, co-lead of the project, said: ‘Plastic has changed the way we live. It has become an essential part of the global economy to such an extent, that there is now a crisis of control.

‘We need new ways of thinking about the problems of plastic use. The circular economy, which emphasises design for environmental protection and minimisation of waste, offers some important approaches.’

The funding for Hull is one of eight new research projects worth £8m that will explore new and different ways of making, using and recycling plastics announced today by the Science Minister, Chris Skidmore.

Designing-out Plastic Waste, led by University College London, will create a new bacteria-based recycling technology for plastics that will consume plastics, breaking them down into reusable material. A new Plastics Waste Innovation Hub will also be created at the University, bringing together researchers and businesses to consider new and innovative methods to recycle plastics.

139,Mandatory recycled content in plastic bottles wins,"This percentage will be calculated as an average for each member state.

This is an essential component to ensure the success of the 90% collection target, to be achieved in 2029, as well as a huge step forward for stimulating the demand for secondary materials, and for driving the necessary investment in collection, sorting and recycling.

 

 The private waste management industry has been in strong support of such a proposal to be given the green light. We will now start to plan the necessary investments that are needed in our sector to innovate and expand the separate collection, develop sorting and recycling capacity across Europe. We are ready to deliver the quality and quantity, and play our role in transforming the vision of a new plastics economy into reality.

 

 This positive outcome is the news that the European Union has been needing to hear for a long time. We can now truly say that we are becoming a circular economy, and our companies will be there to play their roles and ensure the success of this vital shift.

 

 FEAD’s president, Jean-Marc Boursier said: „This crucial signal to the market will trigger investments in sorting and recycling facilities. A demand shock in the EU is truly needed to boost recycling and make Circular Economy a reality. This new Directive will show how a real demand policy will dramatically raise the uptake for recycled plastics in beverage bottles, by gathering all market actors along the production and waste value chain.“",Germany,2018.12

154,Gove Unveils Long-Awaited Resources & Waste Strategy For England,"Businesses and manufacturers will “pay the full cost” of recycling or disposing of their packaging waste, government says, under its long-awaited strategy for England’s resources and waste, which has been unveiled by the Environment Secretary today (18 December).

The move aims to overhaul England’s waste system, putting a legal onus on those responsible for producing environmentally damaging waste to take greater responsibility and “foot the bill”.

The announcement forms part of the government’s long-awaited Resources and Waste Strategy for England, which is being labelled as the first comprehensive update in more than a decade.

As well as putting the financial burden of packaging recycling and disposal back onto businesses and manufacturers, proposals within include mandatory food waste prevention targets for businesses, compulsory electronic tracking of waste to clamp-down on illegal movements, tougher penalties for rogue crime operators and what the strategy calls “consistent” recycling for every household.

Waste producers will also be expected to take more responsibility for items that can be harder or costly to recycle including cars, electrical goods, and batteries.

Launching the strategy at Veolia’s recycling centre in London, Environment Secretary Michael Gove said: “Our strategy sets out how we will go further and faster, to reduce, reuse, and recycle. Together we can move away from being a ‘throw-away’ society, to one that looks at waste as a valuable resource.

“We will cut our reliance on single-use plastics, end confusion over household recycling, tackle the problem of packaging by making polluters pay, and end the economic, environmental and moral scandal that is food waste.

“Through this plan we will cement our place as a world leader in resource efficiency, leaving our environment in a better state than we inherited it.”

With an aim of helping to drive recycling, the government says it will introduce a “consistent set of recyclable material for collection”, subject to consultation. This will be funded by industry through Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), which will see industry pay higher fees if their products are harder to reuse, repair or recycle and will encourage sustainable design, subject to consultation.

EPR for packaging will raise between £0.5 billion and £1 billion a year for recycling and disposal, it says. Producers currently pay 10%, which the government wants to increase.

The move follows the Autumn Budget, which announced a “world-leading tax” on plastic packaging that does not meet a minimum threshold of at least 30% recycled content, subject to consultation, from April 2022. This aims to address the current issue of it often being cheaper to use new, non-recycled plastic material despite its greater environmental impact.

As well as setting mandatory food waste targets for businesses, the strategy also sets out to ensure weekly collections of food waste for every household. This will be subject to consultation which will also consider free garden waste collections for households with gardens, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from landfill.

Annual reporting of food surplus and waste by food businesses will also be introduced. Should progress be insufficient in this area, government says it will consult on introducing mandatory targets for food waste prevention.

The strategy also says government will introduce a deposit return scheme that will aim to increase the recycling of single-use drinks containers including bottles, cans, and disposable cups filled at the point of sale.

It will also explore consistent labelling on packaging so consumers know what they can recycle.

Mandatory guarantees and extended warranties on products, with an aim of encouraging manufacturers to design products that last longer and drive up the levels of repair and re-use, will also be explored.

The strategy sits alongside government’s 25 Year Environment Plan, the recently published Bioeconomy Strategy, and the Clean Growth Strategy, which sets out how the UK is cutting carbon emissions to combat climate change and driving economic growth.

The government has also today (18 December) announced £8m of funding for eight new research projects that will explore new and different ways of making, using and recycling plastics.

The government is also investing £20m to tackle plastics and boost recycling: £10m more for plastics research and development and £10m to pioneer innovative approaches to boosting recycling and reducing litter, such as smart bins.

This is in addition to the £20m for plastics research and development through the Plastics Innovation Fund announced in March 2018.

Speaking at Veolia Southwark’s Integrated Waste Management Facility in London, Richard Kirkman, Veolia’s Chief Technology and Innovation Officer, said:“The government has listened to industry and these steps have the clear potential to dramatically change the way the sector operates to increase recycling and recovery rates.

“With consistent collections and advanced facilities like this at Southwark more recyclable materials can be collected for reprocessing into new products. As a business we are ready to invest, to take advantage of new technology, build more infrastructure and work with brand owners and local authorities to harness resources on an industrial scale.

“It’s the direction we have been hoping and waiting for, and with the public and businesses playing their part the UK can build a sustainable future.”

Paul Vanston, CEO of the Industry Council for Packaging and the Environment (INCPEN) said:“Substantial credit is due to Secretary of State Michael Gove, Environment Minister Therese Coffey and officials for the high quality and depth of their engagement work in the lead up to this Resources & Waste Strategy.

“The focus on whole-system changes is welcome including packaging reforms, consistency of councils’ household collections, and ways to increase investment in recycling infrastructure.”

Sir James Bevan, Chief Executive of the Environment Agency, said:“We support a circular economy and welcome the resource and waste strategy that will help us all deliver it.

“The plan embodies a solid commitment to tackling serious and organised waste crime, which drains the economy and blights communities.

“Last year, the EA closed down over 800 illegal sites and carried out 93 successful prosecutions. The strategy sets to build on our successes, with additional resources, better innovation and improved partnerships across government and enforcement agencies.”

ESA’s executive director, Jacob Hayler, said:“It’s important to understand that policy decisions in this important area can make a real difference to the economy. We now have the opportunity to boost recycling and cut waste – creating over 50,000 jobs with £8 billion private sector investment in the process – but for this to happen the high-level ambition in the strategy will need to be turned into detailed actions that matter.”

“This strategy provides a much-needed framework to reboot recycling and support progress towards a more circular economy,” says CIWM Executive Director Chris Murphy.

“It proposes many measures that CIWM has long been calling for, including fundamental reform of packaging producer responsibility, new producer responsibility schemes for other challenging waste streams such as tyres, and the full roll out of separate food waste collection.

“Importantly, the strategy also acknowledges the need for action right at the top of the waste hierarchy. As well as a focus on food waste prevention and measures to address some of the key barriers to reuse and remanufacture, CIWM also welcomes the commitment to mirror the EU level ambitions to extend eco-design to embrace resource efficiency.

“The range of measures to tackle waste crime are also welcome and reflects work done by CIWM, ESA and others to keep this growing problem on the Government’s agenda. The proposal for mandatory electronic tracking of waste, meanwhile, will not only help to prevent waste crime but will also provide better data to ensure that the economic value of secondary materials can be fully captured.

“There is still a lot of hard work to do, however, and we have an unrivalled opportunity as a sector to engage with Government over the next few months as the raft of expected consultations are launched. CIWM and other key bodies including the Resource Association, INCPEN, ESA and WRAP will be holding a major engagement event in London on 13th February to bring together stakeholders from across the sector to discuss the future of packaging producer responsibility, the role of a Deposit Return Scheme and the consistency agenda.”

158,Welcome to GCU: the University for the Common Good,"This programme is designed to prepare our 21st century Engineering students for the changing economic world and how their knowledge of business is an essential component of this. Students will be taught team and presentation skills as an essential component of the programme.

The programme is split into two parts. The first is to introduce business skills to Engineers looking at the concepts behind a business plan, team working, design thinking techniques for decision making and market research.

The second part focuses on applying those skills to the Circular Economy by introducing the students to the concept of the circular economy which seeks to retain the value of the material resources within the economic cycle for as long as possible. Global Consumption continues to grow, and with the full environmental cost of primary materials, realised in the economy, materials too readily end up as waste, which is considered to have little value and is discarded, usually to landfill. The programme will explain and provide insight into the relationship organisations have with material resources consumed and what pratices might be adopted to embed circular economy thinking into mainstream business practice. Once the principles of the circular economy have been presented and explored by the students, they will, within teams, develop a plan to deliver their chosen service or product. This will be delivered through a short report and final presentation.

159,Seminar on plastic recycling to take place in Tunis - Environment,"Seminar on plastic recycling to take place in Tunis As part of SwitchMed, a project for the sustainable economy

(ANSAmed) - TUNIS, DECEMBER 17 - A seminar planned for December 18 and 19 at the Novotel Hotel in Tunis will aim to promote interaction between the Tunisian and European plastic recycling industries, with the goal of creating future forms of collaboration.

 

 The seminar, titled ""The Circular Economy of Plastic: Best Practices and Networking"", is the third event in Tunisia as part of the SwitchMed project, which is financed by the European Union to support and strengthen social and ecological innovations in various countries in the Mediterranean.

 

 SwitchMed is coordinated by the EU; the UN Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO); the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP), part of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP); the Regional Activity Centre for Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP/RAC); and UNEP's Division of Technology, Industry and Economics (UNEP/DTIE).

 

 In particular, SwitchMed's activities are aimed at strengthening the internationalisation of startups and SME in the southern Med region by improving their ability to manage resource innovation, ecology, and efficiency. UNIDO decided to focus on the plastic industry and in particular on products, processes, and applications that contribute to closing the cycle of the circular economy.

 

 To that end, UNIDO is promoting the exchange of know-how, best practices, and technologies that support the development of the plastic recycling industry in Tunisia.

 

 Plastic waste collection, treatment, and recycling in Tunisia are mainly informal (80%).

 

 In addition, the most recent statistics show that the annual quantity of plastic collected and recycled in the ECOLEF system, managed by the National Agency for Waste Management (ANGED), went down significantly after the revolution, from 16,000 tons in 2010 to 5,600 in 2017.

 

 A real chance therefore exists to improve recycling collection, both in environmental and economic terms, as well as in the direct impact on the plastic materials sector in Tunisia.

 

 To take advantage of this opportunity, Tunisia must aim to build a formal industry for waste treatment based on innovation, green jobs, and a stable trade balance (because the majority of plastic is imported); integrate informal parties into the formal economy; and to improve the collection and selection of waste to add value to the recycling process.(ANSAmed).",Italy,2018.12

163,Biomass sidestreams: Promising feedstock to achieve a sustainable bioeconomy,"Hartmut Welck, Project Manager at Steinbeis 2i GmbH puts across the point that biomass sidestreams offer a high potential to achieve the goal of a sustainable bioeconomy

A major challenge for the future is the high competition on feedstock for different applications (like for energy and/or material usages) with implications on rising prices for biomass sources, rising biomass harvestings and rising transporting distances and costs. The availability of raw materials and the efficiency of their use will, therefore, become a new competitive advantage. Therefore, biomass sidestreams offer high potential in terms of a multi-cascading usage and also in respect to achieving close-loop-systems.

The biobased economy is seen by many as a future base for a sustainable society and economy. New innovative techniques, partnerships, businesses and policies are being developed, replacing fossil-based fuels and materials with renewable materials. Biomass, as a renewable and abundant resource, has many direct and indirect applications for food, feed, fuels, fertilizers, chemicals and materials. In a sustainable bioeconomy, wastes and industrial side streams will play an even more significant role as raw materials. (1)

The EC H2020 funded project AGRIFORVALOR (www.agriforvalor.eu) focusses on the valorisation potential of biomass sidestreams (2) by facilitating innovation partnership networks, aligning multi-actors from primary sector (agriculture and forestry) with the business and research community piloted in three hubs, Hungary, Ireland and Andalusia (Spain).

The EC Directive 2008/98 sets the basic waste management concepts and definitions, such as definitions of waste, recycling and recovery. It explains when waste ceases to be waste and becomes a secondary raw material and how to distinguish between waste, by-products and residues. (3)

Sidestreams role in achieving a sustainable bioeconomy is important to broaden the feedstock base without increased land usage and added to this, they are non-food competitive. (4) In addition, circular concepts can be successfully applied to biobased production chain in terms of “waste” valorisation, as each step in the supply chain of biobased products may provide sidestreams with different characteristics, which can be valorised in various ways. (5)

For Europe (EU-27), available biomass sidestreams were estimated to be 314 MTOE, of which estimated agricultural residues (89 MTOE) and (primary and secondary) forestry residues (34 MTOE) are the main sources as shown in figure 1. (6)

In figure 2, a rough estimation of agricultural and forest-based biomass sidestreams (kton) available within the AGRIFORVALOR Innovation Design Hubs is given.

From figure 2, it follows that the different hubs each have their own specific palette of available biomass sidestreams. In Andalusia, there is a huge availability of residues from the olive groves and processing industry. Ireland has a large surplus and sidestreams of grass and manure from livestock, while in Hungary there are a lot of dairy sidestreams, and crop residues, including straw and residues of sugar beet and corn production. Depending on the type of biomass sidestreams, different techniques to valorise the biomass sidestreams can be stimulated regionally.

The analysis of valorisation technics of biomass sidestreams in the hubs have shown that for agricultural related biomass sidestreams, digestion, extraction, fermentation, combustion and pyrolysis seem promising techniques resulting in building blocks, intermediates and end products for use in the food, (fine) chemical, functional materials and fuel sector.

For forestry related biomass side­streams, extraction, combustion, pyrolysis, chipping and pelletising are important techniques found to valorise woody sidestreams into marketable products, such as heat, electrical power, fertilizer, biochar, bio-oil and syngas.

Agricultural biomass sidestreams are mainly valorised to food applications, probably due to its calorific value in combination with the cost-effectiveness of the techniques and biomass side-streams. (7)

As concerns good practice cases, there are promising examples, such as olive biomass sidestream valorised as functional foods, food supplements and active pharmaceutical ingredients (Natac),(8) sawmill sidestreams valorised as wood pellets (Laois Sawmills) (9) plus meadow grass valorised as bioplastic, fine chemicals and natural fertilizer (BioWert). (10)

An internet application presents valorisation techniques and good practice cases: the Sidestream Value Tool. This digital interactive and dynamic tool enables the sharing of information, connecting multi-actors and identifying exploitation topics and new business models. It also allows registered users to add more sidestream profiles.

Biomass sidestreams have a massive potential to contribute to Europe’s policy on renewable energy and biobased economy. Many innovations are ongoing. This comprises research as well as building up experiences at pilot scale, market implementation and business development. A sustainable circular biobased future is coming closer, but still, a giant step has to be taken in this transition from a fossil-based economy to a sustainable renewable and biobased economy.

The transition will be stepwise, building on recently developed techniques and working on innovations through cross-sectoral and interdisciplinary research and development activities. Besides the local availability of biomass sidestreams, the local availability of knowledge, experience, culture and policy context will determine which valorisation techniques are most suited. The ability to learn, cooperate and implement locally is very important for success. Connecting to multi-actor networks, including biomass producers, science, education, and the finance and business sector, is key for access to knowledge and business solutions, and for achieving a sustainable bio­economy in the future.

165,UK islands called on to stop spread of 'toxic' plastic,"Island communities across the UK have been urged to lead the fight against plastic pollution.

Anti-plastic charity Surfers Against Sewage have joined with Parley for the Oceans, a global oceans network, to target small cold water islands around the UK in helping to clean up the oceans.

The initiative will ask people to apply to become community leaders in their islands. The community leaders will then receive training to support them as they gather support in their community for the clean-up project.

People can now submit their island to be considered in one of 10 communities tasked with leading the charge against plastic pollution.

Once selected, the 10 islands will be asked to find community-based solutions to the plastic pollution crisis, with the hope of setting a global template for combating the issue.

Ben Hewitt, director of campaigns and projects at Surfers Against Sewage said: “Our island communities are on the front line battling the scourge of plastic pollution and we want to support the groups and individuals working tirelessly to tackle avoidable single-use plastic.

“This project provides the tools, guidance and strategy to support community-led action to free where we live from avoidable single-use plastic.”

Within each island, the programme will focus on three key points of action; avoid, intercept and redesign.

In order to avoid plastic, it is hoped the island will achieve a ‘plastic free community’ status which will incorporate local authorities and schools.

To intercept plastic before it goes into the ocean, the islands should organise regular beach clean-up events.

Finally, to redesign the island’s plastic footprint, the community leader should collaborate with businesses and manufacturers to reduce plastic output from the source.

Parley for the Oceans founder Cyrill Gutsch said: “Out there, it’s clear: plastic is a design failure. It is not ready for a circular economy.

“It is a toxic material and needs to be replaced by a new generation of materials. Collaboration, creativity, community and eco-innovation — this is the way forward.”",United Kingdom,2018.12

As much as possible, components are “D4R” — designed for reuse. The brand’s signature wooden frames are recycled from the motor industry. “It means the waste of one industry",United Kingdom,2018.12
179,DS Smith CFO on driving an innovative business model,"When packaging group DS Smith approached Adrian Marsh to become its CFO in 2013, he could immediately see the potential the packaging group could offer.

Marsh’s experience in key finance roles at pharma giant AstraZeneca and grocer Tesco could provide chief executive Miles Roberts with a co-pilot skilled acquainted with building scale to challenging the sector leaders.

“I wanted to be supporting an ambitious and committed CEO, someone that you could not only learn from, but had a plan that I believed in,” says Marsh. He already knew DS Smith as it was a major provider of packaging to Tesco and was known for its innovative approach in the ‘circular economy’ approach to maximising recycling. It was a company I was interested in, where I could add value,” he says.

When they met Roberts did not hold back on his ambition, wanting to double the size of the company within five years. “This was an industry sector that was fragmented, that was one of the last in the category to put the customer first, it hadn’t invested behind innovation, it hadn’t got behind consumers,” says Marsh.

“In his mind, there was a huge opportunity to build a business of scale, where you could invest in innovation that could win business on a large-scale basis, clearly with FMCG companies on a pan-European basis,” he adds.

The ambition to double the size of the group was delivered in four years, revenues have grown from around £1.9 billion in 2012 to more than £4.8 billion last year. The plan is now to double again, over the next five years- while offering an innovative approach that ensures competitive advantage.

Following a management degree at Cardiff University, Marsh spent three years as a graduate trainee at aluminium group British Alcan, briefly dipped his toe in investment banking, before ending up as an accountant in treasury at hospitality group Grand Metropolitan.

If there’s a mainstay in his career it’s a close tie to treasury, which has ensured a close eye on the capital position of companies he’s worked for, including Inchcape when it was a conglomerate before being reduced to the car dealership group of today. From a stint in PwC’s treasury and corporate finance function he returned to Inchcape as group treasurer, still in his 20s.

The Asian financial crisis that hit Inchcape hard and the subsequent break-up of the group, proved to be a sobering experience for Marsh, before he started in the same role at glass products group Pilkington, with a mandate to re-engineer the treasury function, refinance the business.

“There was a pretty big change programme going on, so the role was about providing liquidity and financing for that. That was when I started having other roles outside mainstream finance, so from there I also took over group controller and then as divisional finance director for building products,” he adds.

The broad set of responsibilities would be key to career progression. “Few FDs have a broad experience in corporate finance, dealing with debt capital markets, foreign exchange, funding liquidity, risk management,” he says. It was experience he took to recently-merged pharma giant AstraZeneca, to re-engineer treasury and corporate finance- resulting in being made European finance director.

An environment of supporting drug pipelines in a heavily regulated space, while at the same time trying to drive through change was “was where the satisfaction came from,” he says.

All of these experiences came together in a combined role of tax, treasury and corporate finance at Tesco, which under CEO Sir Terry Leahy was being turned into one of the world’s largest grocers.

“There was a huge need to regularise the corporate finance of the business in funding, liquidity, risk management, during a time of fast growth particularly in emerging markets, that came with a lot of risk, so an interesting time,” he reveals.

An ill-fated roll out of Tesco’s Fresh & Easy format in the US he views philosophically. “In hindsight there were a couple of things that could have been done differently, but in the end a lot of it was timing. I don’t think anyone saw the credit crisis coming, just as it was being rolled out,” he says. “I can see why it was a very compelling strategy and I think CEOs should be rewarded for taking a risk,” he insists.

With all that experience, especially in global companies, Marsh could see how he would fit in with the DS Smith growth plan of acquiring businesses to attain critical mass. “We’d then have the scale to serve effectively the most demanding customers such as Nestle, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Mondelez, Mars on a pan-European level by bringing costs down,” he says.

He says the opportunity became available because packaging was a fragmented market. “Cadbury in the UK might be dealing with four different packaging suppliers, that just does not make sense, as every colour will be different, every quality will be different. If you’re a branded FMCG or food and drinks company, you need to have consistency,” says Marsh.

Another area of building competitive advantage was achieved through forging new forms of relationships with customers. “You’re trying to work with your customer to reduce the amount of paper that is used in the making of a box, because if you can do that you can reduce the cost. We can say we’re working with you to reduce the amount of fibre required, which is not only better from a sustainability perspective, but equally from a value sharing perspective,” he adds.

Ultimately, it speaks to the model of the circular economy, citing the example of its work with Marsh’s former employer. “Every box used in a Tesco store gets back to a distribution centre, we collect from distribution centre and its then returned back to them as a box in 14 days,” he reveals.

His approach reflects the growing push for finance leaders to account for all the environmental and social impacts they and their customers nd suppliers are creating. “We can work with the sustainability and CSR agendas of our customers. Whatever we don’t need in our business, we will sell back to other papermakers who will use it as their raw material,” says Marsh.

Despite the group’s dramatic growth, Marsh says DS Smith has scope for further expansion in Europe, as it is can claim around 15% market share on the continent at the moment. “It doesn’t feel like we’re at the limit, although there’s certain markets where our strong market share makes significant growth more difficult,” says Marsh.

“We run a three year corporate plan process every year, and we will set ourselves a number of challenges, we will put future scenarios up, and we will work through what those scenarios mean to the business, what better opportunities could we get through additional scale,” he reveals.

On that basis, a foray into Asia is discounted, but the US has seen acquisitions giving access to a market “which was behind Europe from a retail perspective. Solutions we have in Europe that aren’t available in North America, we felt would give us competitive advantage.

“The US also has different growth opportunities, but has established retailers, branded goods companies, FMCGs, that understand how supply chains operate and where value is, so we felt we can have similar dialogues to those we have in Europe,” he says.

With all the experience of running large scale roll-outs globally, Marsh says: “The most important thing about going into America was having a paper supplier there, otherwise the big guys could have run us out of town. It meant that although North America was a big step, it was a relatively well covered risk,” he adds.

Marsh says his background in corporate finance and treasury has given him a good sense of how to understand risk and reward. “I’m rarely looking back at the past, but always having to look into the future- thinking will happen in exchange rates? What are the impacts of movements? Therefore what does risk look like?” he says.

To the background of Brexit and raising of trade tariffs, what is his priority? “Liquidity, liquidity, liquidity. We have just signed a new £1.4bn five year revolving credit facility with our banks, because to me the most important thing as CFO is to make sure the company doesn’t run out of money, that you’ve got the liquidity to do what you need to do,” he says.

“People get very fussed about leverage. But what’s really important is liquidity, to be sure you’ve got facilities and financing to make sure that you can operate as a business, that is the most important thing.”

In the meantime, DS Smith has gained regulatory clearance to acquire Spanish rival Europac for Euro1.7bn, making it one of the group’s largest acquisitions. It’s part of an ongoing process to geographically diversify.

“Six years ago we were 85% UK and 15% non-UK, now by luck or good judgement, we’re the polar opposite of that,” says Marsh. “It’s obviously by design, as we were over-exposed to the UK, whereas continental Europe is where our customers are and where the growth is, along with North America,” he says.",United Kingdom,2018.12

208,EURACTIV Press Release Site,"During “The European Plastics Industries – Towards Circularity” event held in Brussels on 11 December, David Baker, RPC Group Industry Affairs Director, was confirmed as Chairman of the Polyolefin Circular Economy Platform – PCEP. He succeeds Eugenio Longo, Borealis Head of Sustainability and EU Affairs, who had been the Chairman of PCEP since its inception.

David Baker commended his predecessor, praising him for his passionate leadership. Eugenio Longo’s strategic insights and strong dedication to the Circular Economy has made PCEP a reality.

David said: “I am delighted to take on this important role. Polyolefins are a significant part of the plastics family and PCEP will ensure polyolefins become increasingly circular. My short term focus will be to support the PCEP Steering Board in its drive to expand its membership to include brand-owners/EPR schemes, retailers and waste management companies in addition to producers, converters and recyclers.”

David Baker has over 35 years’ experience in the plastics packaging industry. He is RPC Group Industry Affairs Director and is also Chairman of INCPEN (the Industry Council for Packaging and the Environment). He is also active in the Council of the British Plastics Federation (BPF) and Vice President of the European Plastics Converters (EuPC).

Polyolefins account for 50% of the total amount of plastics consumed in Europe and 70% of plastic packaging representing 40% of European plastics demand application wise. 27 million tonnes of post-consumer plastic waste were collected in Europe in 2016 from which about 16 million tonnes are polyolefins and 12 million tonnes are polyolefins packaging waste. PCEP seeks to identify the barriers and opportunities to increase Europe’s polyolefins recycling and work towards ensuring the supply of high quality recycled polyolefins for the European market. PCEP is a multi-stakeholder platform with a mission to advance the circular economy by increasing the reuse and recycling of polyolefin based products and the use of recyclates as raw material. By working together, the platform aims to ensure long-term sustainability for polyolefin products.",Belgium,2018.12
210,Circular Plastics Alliance launched in Europe,"The European Commission has launched its Circular Plastics Alliance, an initiative to reduce plastic waste and promote recycling of plastics.

The Circular Plastics Alliance, a multi-stakeholder platform, will comprise key industry stakeholders from every step of the plastics value chain, including waste collectors, recyclers, plastics producers and retailers; and will aim to boost recycling of plastics in the EU. Stakeholders will be drawn particularly from the packaging, construction and automotive sectors – all of which have been identified as producing high volumes of waste plastics – and will pursue three primary objectives:

Reporting on obstacles faced by the Circular Plastics Alliance, in order to identify and address issues facing circular plastics initiatives; and

Monitoring the Alliance’s progress towards increased recycling and reuse of plastics in Europe.

The European Strategy For Plastics, adopted in January 2018, commits Member States to ensuring new products on the EU market must include at least 10 million tons of recycled plastics by 2025. The Commission hopes the Circular Plastics Alliance will facilitate its progress towards this goal.

First Vice-President Frans Timmermans said: “Close cooperation within and between all the links in the plastics value chain is essential if we are to achieve a true circular plastics economy and ensure that recycled plastics find their way to new products, instead of into landfills or the incinerators. The Circular Plastics Alliance aims to facilitate this cooperation, building on the commitments the plastics industry has already made and encouraging even more ambitious action. Europe already leads this, and Europe will be the first one to reap the benefits as well. This is the best way to show the world that circular plastic economy is good for the business and good for the environment.”

216,EU moves towards more environment-friendly fertilisers,"EU ambassadors today endorsed a deal with the European Parliament on new rules for placing fertilising products on the EU market.

The regulation harmonises standards for fertilisers produced from organic or secondary raw materials in the EU, opening up new possibilities for their production on a large scale. In addition, it sets harmonised limits for a range of contaminants contained in mineral fertilisers.

According to the draft regulation, EU fertilising products bearing the ""CE marking"" will have to fulfil certain requirements to benefit from free circulation in the EU's internal market. These requirements will include obligatory maximum contaminant levels, the use of defined component material categories and labelling requirements. Manufacturers of fertilisers that do not bear the CE marking will still have the possibility of placing them on their national market.

The new regulation, which will replace the current 2003 fertilisers regulation, covers all types of fertilisers (mineral, organic, soil improvers, growing matters, etc.).

It will start applying three years from its entry into force.

The draft regulation will have to be formally adopted by the European Parliament and the Council. It will enter into force on the twentieth day after its publication in the Official Journal of the EU.

Fertilising products are used in agriculture to improve plant growth.

The Commission presented its proposal in March 2016 as part of the EU's circular economy action plan. One of its main objectives is to encourage large scale fertiliser production from domestic organic or secondary raw materials in line with the circular economy model, by transforming waste into nutrients for crops.

217,Styrenics Circular Solutions is now formally established as an independent legal entity and collaboration platform,"Styrenics Circular Solutions (SCS), the joint industry initiative to drive the shift to a more circular economy for styrenics, has announced its incorporation as an independent organisation and collaboration platform.

SCS’ four founding members, INEOS Styrolution, Total, Trinseo and Versalis (Eni), signed the SCS incorporation agreement to further solidify their commitment to transform the styrenics industry by unlocking polystyrene’s unique circularity potential.

New technology will enable polystyrene, EPS and other styrenic based plastics to be fully recycled.

The newly incorporated platform will enable the inclusion of new members across the styrenics value chain and waste management stream, as well as build on the collaboration with long-standing partners, such as PlasticsEurope.

SCS will place a strong focus on engaging waste collection and sorting partners to recover more polystyrene and EPS-based products.

Thereby, SCS strives to build a close link between waste stream volumes of relevant quality and its high-tech recycling processes.

“The potential for polystyrene recycling is enormous. We know that polystyrene has an unparalleled capacity for closed-loop recycling, when properly collected and sorted,” said Jens Kathmann, Secretary General of SCS.

“The SCS founding members, are fully committed to our objective of full circularity. We therefore welcome partners across the entire value chain, including recyclers, waste management companies, converters and brand owners, to join SCS to link waste streams to our innovative recycling technologies.”",United Kingdom,2018.12

223,Scotland's fashion sector is embracing the circular economy this Christmas - here's how you can too,"Last month, I watched a session of the UK’s Environmental Audit Committee online, focused on the subject of ‘sustainability in the fashion industry’. Representatives of retail giants including Marks and Spencer and Arcadia Group and online-only retailers boohoo and ASOS were quizzed by MPs about the transparency of their supply chain, the ethics of their employment practices and the environmental impact of the ‘fast fashion’ industry.

As a Scottish fashion industry insider and ‘circular economy’ design and manufacturing specialist, this Committee session was particularly interesting. It’s true that, in addition to being very poorly paid in parts of the world, the global fashion industry produces a staggering amount of waste and pollution every year. Estimates suggest that two-thirds of an average person’s wardrobe is never worn again a month after purchase and it is thought that old clothing and textiles make up over a quarter of all landfill.

In addition, the production methods associated with many textiles, for example, cotton, require a huge amount of water, which can in turn create irrigation problems and drought. There are also serious concerns about the volume of microfibres and chemicals released into the public water supply via washing clothes.

For these reasons and others, awareness around the ‘circular economy’ concept has grown within the fashion industry in recent years, championed by industry leaders such as Patagonia and Stella McCartney.

A circular economy is broadly defined as the antithesis of a traditional linear economy model (make, use, dispose) where we instead strive to design out waste and reduce the environmental impact created during the production and consumption process: keeping resources in use for as long as possible, extracting the maximum value from them while in use, then recovering and regenerating products and materials at the end of each life cycle in a closed loop.

From 2013 – 2016, the Scottish Textiles and Leather Association (now Scottish Textiles) took a leadership role in implementing circular economy principles by working with Zero Waste Scotland to build knowledge and skills in the industry.

It’s heartening to see the developments that have been made since then, with a range of Scottish microbusinesses, SMEs and larger established players leading the way in demonstrating the commercial viability of circular economy initiatives.

These companies include, at the luxury end, Johnstons of Elgin cashmere which has committed to sustainable fibre production by launching a goat herding education programme in Inner Mongolia to reduce the environmental impact of cashmere production and ensuring traceability in the supply chain.

Assemble by Kalopsia is a resource efficient bespoke manufacturing service that practices closed loop and offers the customer a range of style options that can be selected online. Colour Elements is an online and in-person service that provides training to help consumers make the right colour choices and avoid those fashion mistakes that mean wardrobe purchases are never worn.

Scotland has always excelled in the global fashion industry. I noticed recent media coverage of Chanel creating a UK base in London recently but few people realise that Chanel already owns Barrie Knitwear in the Borders today.

As we enter 2019, our vibrant mix of traditional businesses and emerging new companies are striving to retain their influence by embracing sustainability through the implementation of circular economy principles.

Given that much of ‘circular economy’ thinking focuses on the design of manufacturing and engineering processes, it can be difficult to see where we as individuals can begin to make a difference and reduce the shocking levels of waste associated with fashion.

As Christmas shopping season gets into full swing this week, here are a few ways you can begin to be more ‘circular’ in your fashion gift-giving:
• Don’t risk buying an unwanted present, buy a giftcard instead. Or, at least, make sure you know the correct size and colour preference of the recipient and include a gift receipt with a clear expiry date.
• Why buy clothes at all in 2019, when you can simply buy a subscription to rent or lease clothes? Think about it, why have wardrobes stuff full of clothes you never wear. Check out innovative brands like www.mudjeans.eu or www.laurasdresses.com for more details.
• Why not exchange skills rather than physical gifts? Good at mending clothes, painting nails or giving shoulder massages? Save yourself some money and spare the planet’s resources at the same time.
• Do four members of the same household really need their own high-powered hairdryer? Think about buying joint gifts to be shared between the recipients.
• Wherever possible, buy from charity stores and/or buy locally, particularly locally-made products created from reclaimed or surplus materials.

226,Europe’s ‘Kafka-esque’ recycling dilemma for precious metals,"Precious metals are big business in the EU but possible conflicts between recycling policies and chemical management mean that the industry risks missing out on a golden opportunity.

Hear ‘precious metals’ and think bracelets, rings and gold bars. But that is not the reality: One-third of the globe’s 4,500 tonnes gold demand is needed in industrial and manufacturing processes, while only 50% of silver’s 35,000 tonnes demand comes from jewellery.

Precious metals like gold, silver and platinum are used more and more in our electronic devices, the batteries of our electric vehicles and even our satellites and spacecraft.

But just like any other useful material, precious metals are facing recycling challenges on all fronts. One of the main problems is the simple matter of collecting used items like old phones, laptops and tablets.

Consumer culture, programmed obsolescence and simple wear-and-tear mean that people are now replacing their smartphones on a regular basis.

Research in the United States showed that although phones last on average just under five years, consumers upgrade or replace their devices roughly every two years.

Those phones either end up passed on to a family member or friend or, more likely, in the back of a drawer in case of an emergency.

In Europe, only one-third of waste electrical and electronic equipment is collected and reported, which means four tonnes and 40 tonnes of gold and silver, respectively, goes unused. Only 10% of recycled gold comes from electronics, the rest is unwanted jewellery.

At an event organised by the European Precious Metals Federation on 5 December, President Heinz-Günter Schenzel called for “intensive recycling” and highlighted the fact that gold, silver et al can be reused over and over, unlike other recyclates like plastic.

Chemicals management expert Hugo Waeterschoot pointed out that the high value of precious metals makes recycling an extremely attractive option. A lack of business case often acts as a barrier in other sectors.

Waeterschoot also said that the relationship between recycling and EU chemical management law, known as REACH, is such that they are “not always best friends”.

Hopes to boost recycling levels have to be tempered against 2006’s REACH regulation, which evaluates the potential impact of substances on human health and the environment.

That is because the industrial processes used by precious metal producers include substances like lead, which is itself a hazardous material regulated by REACH.

During a presentation of a study on the implications of REACH law on the sector, expert Tim Becker outlined how different approaches could affect the circular economy, concluding that there is a “possible conflict” between policies.

Other stakeholders, like Egbert Lox from metals company Umicore, explained how differences between waste management directives and chemical management regulations have created an uneven playing field in Europe.

“From a logistics point of view, we have a Kafka-esque situation in Europe, where there are even different rules between regions, trucks are being stopped where there aren’t any borders,” Lox revealed, adding that a review of existing laws is “overdue”.

In the EU, directives lay down the broad strokes of an objective, with member states free to decide how to transpose rules into national law, while regulations have the same legal force throughout the entire bloc.

The Belgian ministry of economy’s Simon Cogen agreed that “directives are problematic” and added that the EU should look into a broad all-encompassing sustainability regulation.

The European Commission’s Enrique Garcia-John, a policy officer dealing with REACH, suggested that part of the problem is that stakeholders from the waste and chemical industries have not communicated well with one another.

That point was echoed by the European Chemical Agency’s Matti Vainio, who said that “understanding trade-offs and problems is absolutely vital” and that the industry has to “clarify what their problems actually are”.

He added that the tools provided by ECHA are still sufficient but suggested that there are “more fundamental problems in waste rules”.

The silver lining seems to be that different stakeholders are now on the same page, in that all want the circular economy to take off in a big way, while also safeguarding worker health.

Garcia-John concluded that the next Commission will have to pay attention to the issue, as the borderline between what is a product and what is waste becomes “fuzzier” by the day.",Belgium,2018.12
229,The FINANCIAL - Nestlé Waters North America Will Achieve 25% Recycled Plastic by 2021,"The FINANCIAL -- Nestlé Waters North America, one of the leading beverage companies in North America, announced that it will achieve 25 percent recycled plastic across its U.S. domestic portfolio by 2021. The company plans to continue expanding its use of recycled materials in the coming years, further setting an ambition to reach 50 percent recycled plastic by 2025.

The company is expanding its relationship with key supplier, Plastrec, and working with other suppliers, to support the company’s ability to nearly quadruple its use of food-grade recycled plastic, or rPET, in less than three years. This comes on the heels of Nestlé Waters’ announcement last month about the expansion of its partnership with CarbonLITE, as the rPET supplier builds a third U.S. facility in the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania.

In its 2016 report, The New Plastics Economy: Rethinking the future of plastics, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation found that most plastic packaging is used only once, and that 95 percent of the value of plastic packaging material, worth $80-120 billion annually, is lost to the economy. This latest milestone positions Nestlé Waters to play a greater role in addressing the nation’s growing recycling challenges, while unlocking the full economic and environmental benefits of treating plastic as a valuable resource, rather than as a waste product.

In addition to the company’s multi-year supplier agreements, Nestlé Waters continues to make indirect investments in recycling infrastructure in the U.S. through its $6 million investment in the Closed Loop Fund. In municipalities such as Waterbury, Connecticut, the investment fund is supporting enhanced recycling programs with a goal of increasing the current city recycling rate from 6 percent to 25 percent by 2020. Just recently, Closed Loop Fund announced a $1.5 million investment in rPlanet Earth, the world’s first completely vertically integrated manufacturer of post-consumer recycled PET.

Nestlé Waters also supports recycling collection programs through organizations like Keep America Beautiful, including an integrated recycling education and awareness initiative for the 10,000 students affected by the Flint water crisis. The company was also the first beverage company in North America to add How2Recycle information on the labels of its major U.S. brands. These labels include a reminder for consumers to empty the bottle and replace the cap before recycling.

Earlier this year, as a result of Nestlé Waters’ existing relationship with rPET supplier Plastrec, the company unveiled a new 100 percent rPET Nestlé Pure Life bottle, the only major nationally distributed bottled water on the market to be made using 100 percent recycled plastic.

In California, Nestlé Waters is leading the industry in its use of recycled plastic: more than 42% of the plastic the company uses across all brands sold in California is made from rPET– more than any other beverage manufacturer in the state. In fact, all single-serve bottles of Arrowhead Brand Mountain Spring Water and Nestlé Pure Life Purified Water produced in California are made with 50 percent recycled plastic.

This latest milestone is part of parent company Nestlé SA’s broader ambition to develop a circular economy for plastics, and to prevent packaging from ending up as litter. The global company recently announced that it has signed the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment to work collectively on solutions that address the root causes of plastics waste and pollution.

Nestlé Waters North America’s packaging, which is predominantly made using PET plastic, is already 100 recyclable, and the company views its push toward using more recycled materials to be its next phase in making its packaging more sustainable and addressing the issue of plastic waste.",Netherlands,2018.12

But the former boss of the European Chemicals Agency says the EU could do with going back to the drawing board.

Geert Dancet was executive director of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for a decade and former head of the European Commission’s REACH unit until 2007. He is now a consultant on chemicals legislation and competition matters.

He spoke to EURACTIV’s Sam Morgan on the sidelines of the European Precious Metals Federation’s event on chemical management and the circular economy.

Climate change grabs the headlines these days but circular economy doesn’t seem to be a priority for governments. A new Commission strategy for 2050 includes it under its most ambitious scenario but what needs to change for it to really sit high on the agenda?

The European Commission has already done a lot in this regard, particularly in the long run, when it could be as important as climate change. In the end, we basically need to all change the way we actually act.

So it’s very important that we collect and recycle waste, correctly. Everything needs to be recycled to its maximum extent, which will ultimately support our economy, because it’s a win-win. We have a lot to gain here, as Europe, in terms of a non-toxic environment but also being competitive. We can even collect things from parts of the world that have not taken the step to put a priority on this.

Is technology a barrier here? Or is it more about a behavioural change?

We have the technology. Part of the solution is making sure we return our small electronics, but I think there’s more to it than that. Collection points have to be industry-orientated, so we can strip out things like precious metals, nickel, copper etc.

But we shouldn’t just be focusing on chemicals, the same is true of plastics, which is even more of a problem than metals. Just think about the pollution. We used to talk about metal pollution, like the situation in the Baltic Sea years ago, but now it’s plastic. They have to be recycled, much more so than the low percentages that are currently the state-of-play. The ‘throwaway attitude’ that we have in society has to change.

Will industry sit down, clarify and say what their problems are at the moment? Or are they afraid of losing their competitive edge too much?

I think in the precious metals industry, they get it, as there aren’t so many of them. But in plastics, there are thousands of players; it’s much more difficult for them to organise a comprehensive strategy that says the industry can self-regulate.

I believe a lot in self-regulation but it’s under-developed. It can replace real regulation, which is so difficult these days to get through the decision-making process. We’re looking at waiting times of decades sometimes. I think industry can take it as a moral obligation to try to do this where possible.

You were at ECHA for some years. Can regulatory frameworks keep up with pace of innovation we’re seeing in things like the mobility sector? Or do we need to go back to basics and have a clear-out?

In Europe, I think we could benefit from some going back to the drawing board and integrating a lot more legislation. There’s over 50 pieces that try to regulate chemicals. That’s far too complex, far too many authorities vying with each other, either within member states or at EU level.

They all do complementary things and could work more efficiently together. There needs to be the courage to have a rethink of the system. It’s like with climate change, you need the right motivation for policymakers to make it a priority.

Europe has the most modern chemicals legislation in the world but it’s only modern in the way it is implemented. It still dates back to 2006, so there needs to be the courage to think about how it can be improved, make it more coherent with other policies, like circular economy.",Belgium,2018.12
239,SEPA landfill plan aims to improve compliance and assist transition to a circular economy,"SEPA has launched an ambitious plan that it says will “drive environmental compliance at Scotland’s landfill sites, harness innovation and help the sector responsibly manage site closures and aftercare… as we transition to a circular economy focused on waste reduction, reuse, recycling and energy recovery.”

The Landfill Sector Plan is one of 16 sector plans being launched this year in line with the regulator’s One Planet Prosperity strategy.

In response to mounting scientific evidence about climate change, resource scarcity and security, the sector plans set out a range of actions to help all regulated businesses meet – and go beyond – their compliance obligations.

“This plan is ambitious,” says SEPA Chief Executive Terry A’Hearn. “It spells out how we will use our full suite of regulatory powers, including the creation of a new national enforcement team, in clearer and more powerful ways. It also sets out some new ways such as novel partnerships that we will develop and use to support innovation and transformation in this sector.

“As Scotland’s environmental regulator, we’ll work to ensure operators protect the environment from the impacts of landfilling and ensure that communities are safeguarded. As some wastes break down, they produce powerful emissions such as leachate (a highly polluting liquid that poses a risk to downgrading surface water quality and groundwater aquifers if not adequately contained, extracted and treated) and powerful greenhouse gases such as methane that contribute to climate change.”

There are currently 55 operational landfill sites and 217 non-operational sites regulated by SEPA in Scotland.

Scotland’s landfills provide a waste management solution for the disposal of around 4 million tonnes of waste each year. Over the next three years, SEPA expects to see between 1.3 million to 2 million tonnes of waste a year move from landfill as a result of the Scottish Government’s 2021 ban on the landfilling of biodegradable municipal waste.

Scotland’s globally ambitious circular economy strategy aims to safeguard resources for re-use, recycling and re-manufacturing in Scotland. Doing so will increasingly negate the need for landfill and the Scottish Government’s target is that by 2025, only 5% of waste will be disposed of via landfill.

“The transition to a circular economy is an environmental and economic win-win for Scotland,” Mr A’Hearn adds. “That said, it’s important that we work to ensure operators responsibly manage site closures and aftercare.”

All businesses that SEPA regulates in a sector use water, energy and raw materials to produce the products and services they sell. In doing so, they also create waste and emissions. Sector Plans aim to systematically identify the compliance issues that need to be tackled by sector – and help identify the biggest opportunities to support sectors in going beyond compliance.

In its Landfill Sector Plan, SEPA sets out a number of actions to improve compliance – and to go beyond compliance to help Scotland achieve its circular economy ambitions. These include:
• Focusing regulatory effort, including enforcement interventions, at sites with the worst compliance records and those with greatest community impact.
• Supporting operators to prepare for the ban on landfilling biodegradable municipal waste from 1 January 2021 and the target of no more than 5% residual waste to landfill by 2025.
• Working with operators to ensure that all extractable landfill gas is utilised or, where this is not technically feasible, converted into less harmful gases.
• Identifying opportunities to help the landfill sector to develop and share best practice examples that support compliant operations.
• Developing effective intervention strategies to disrupt and deter illegal activity in partnership with Police Scotland, local authorities, industry trade bodies, other UK environment agencies and other relevant partners.
• Working with partners to support development of alternative products for landfill engineering, potentially reducing the reliance on virgin quarried clay.
• Developing a forum for businesses to work in partnership with SEPA and other stakeholders to consider the sources of the energy used, with the aim of moving away from fossil fuels.
• Working co-operatively with the landfill sector, communities and other partners to promote and develop sustainable land uses for restored landfills.

240,SEPA Plan to Help Scottish Landfill Operators Prepare for the Future,"The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) has unveiled a plan to drive environmental compliance at Scotland’s landfill sites, harness innovation and help the sector responsibly manage site closures and aftercare.

The Landfill Sector Plan is one of 16 sector plans being launched by SEPA this year in line with the regulator’s One Planet Prosperity strategy, which the agency said reflects that if everyone in the world lived as people do in Scotland, we would need three planets. There is only one.

261,Concerns raised over level of waste dumped in landfills,"HUGE quantities of household waste continue to be dumped in Scottish landfill sites.

Figures show more than one million tonnes of municipal waste (1.13m) was buried in 2016 – a 31 per cent drop since 2010.

However England has recorded a 39% fall over the same period, while Wales has seen a 32% drop and Northern Ireland 42%.

Scotland has introduced a statutory ban on sending biodegradable municipal waste to landfill, which will kick in at the start of 2021.

But council leaders have warned it is “unlikely” the ban will be fully achievable in time.

It comes it emerged Highland Council may have to export domestic waste to sites in England at a cost of £80 a tonne due to a lack of facilities.

Experts said alternatives to landfill must be urgently prioritised – including greater use of recycling and waste-to-energy plants.

Malcolm Todd, former managing director of Shore Recycling, said Scotland is at a “crossroads when it comes to the waste management of what is left behind”.

He said: “This requires urgent attention from the Scottish Government as part of their drive to create a circular economy.

“We should be doing more to encourage recycling, but must also recognise the vital contribution that waste-to-energy plants can make, where waste is treated to create heat and power that can benefit local communities rather than being buried in the ground.”

In addition to household rubbish, large amounts of construction and demolition waste are also buried as landfill.

Data from the Scottish Government shows the level of household waste sent to landfill over the past five years has remained broadly the same, while the latest figures for 2017 – which cannot yet be compared with other UK nations – show slight improvement (1.13m to 1.11m).

According to a report published by Biffa last year, the remaining space in landfill sites in Scotland will expire in 2029.

Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said England’s greater reliance in incinerators may explain some of the current imbalance.

He said many Scottish councils are now planning or building incinerators to divert waste from landfill, but should instead focus on recycling.

He added: “Scotland talks a good game on resource use and waste, and there are some good things coming, like the forthcoming deposit return scheme for drinks cans and bottles.

“But we are seeing a rush to incinerators by councils which have failed to do enough on the waste challenge.

“The Scottish Government needs to build on its current plans but also needs to work with councils to get more of the basics right if we are to have any chance of meeting our own ambitious waste targets.”

A Scottish Government spokesman said: “Scotland has introduced a statutory ban on biodegradable municipal waste to landfill, which takes effect on 1 January 2021.

“This will divert our municipal residual waste away from landfill on towards alternative treatment.

“As a result the volumes of household waste that we send to landfill will decline significantly over the next few years.”",United Kingdom,2018.12
262,Pre-budget demands made for Scottish agriculture,"NFU SCOTLAND have outlined their demands for future financial commitments to Scottish agriculture, ahead of next week’s annual Scottish budget statement.

Writing to Finance Secretary Derek Mackay MSP, they mapped out the measures that Scottish farmers need to ensure a smooth transition and a prosperous future outside the EU.

NFUS once again repeated that a ‘no deal’ Brexit scenario must be avoided at all costs and pledged to continue to work with the Scottish Government to ensure that Scotland’s farmers and crofters get the best possible deal from EU exit in the time left available.

It stressed that if the right deal can be struck on the future relationship with the EU, it would create the opportunity to build a new agricultural policy in Scotland that will drive the industry to become more competitive, resilient and profitable.

The union has made it clear in its own proposal for a new agricultural policy for Scotland, that funding should be rebased and targeted solely at those who are active. Three components of ‘Financial Stability’, ‘Productivity Measures’ and ‘Environmental Measures’ would work together to enable productivity gains, building more resilience, and delivering more environmental benefit – in turn, delivering for Scotland’s rural economies.

Commenting on his letter to Derek Mackay, NFUS president Andrew McCornick said: “Clearly how the new Scottish agricultural policy is funded is as important as to how the policies are implemented. The industry must work with the Scottish Government in making the case to the UK Treasury for the fairest possible settlement from any review or future decision on the allocation of intra-UK funding for agriculture,” he stressed.

“We are also working closely with Scottish Government to find a solution to upcoming funding changes proposed for the lifeline Less Favoured Area Support Scheme. Whatever solution is found, it will have consequences for Scottish Government’s spending priorities.”

The case has been made on many occasions to the Scottish Government stressing the vital importance of LFASS funding for the future survival of some of Scotland’s most fragile rural communities. This funding is the backbone of many of Scotland’s agricultural businesses due to the challenging landscapes on which they operate.

“Looking to the future, we want to work with Scottish Government to ensure that Scotland’s next generation of farmers and crofters are supported both by policy and the right financial tools to allow their fledgling businesses to be successful,” he continued. “Following the closure of the New Entrant’s Capital Grant Scheme this year, it is all the more important that the Scottish Government’s spending plans have measures that will inject confidence back into new agricultural businesses by recommitting funding to these schemes.

“Given the challenges farmers and the food sector face in tackling waste and adding value, we have asked for government support to be invested in schemes in local areas that will assist food producers in cutting waste and contributing to the circular rural economy,” he explained. “NFUS has queried whether funding from the underspent Circular Economy Fund could be put in this direction, to assist with shovel ready projects such as pop-up abattoirs or recycling of agricultural plastics.”",United Kingdom,2018.12

The report presents a shared vision, demonstrates how collaboration within the plastic value chain will be a driving force for change, and outlines the future research needs required to fulfil the objectives of the European Plastic Strategy. The technology solutions described are part of an integral approach to make the entire plastics production more circular.

To achieve an overall increased circularity, the report identified a number of key factors:
• Develop repair solutions that extend the lifetime of plastic articles,
• Innovate advanced recycling technologies to increase the value retrieved from plastic waste,
• Incorporate alternative feedstocks in the production of plastics - feedstocks that take waste or by-products from other sectors and processes, such as biological feedstock from the agricultural industry, carbon-based feedstock from the chemical industry and chemical and secondary plastics from the plastic industry.

275,Profile - A.J. Gruber ISTA | Taking a life-cycle view of sustainable packaging,"According to the European Consumer Packaging Perceptions Survey, sustainable packaging is now a must-have. It has grown from a niche that interested a small number of consumers to a major trend that’s influencing purchasing as consumers look to live cleaner and more ethical lifestyles. The research shows that 88% of consumers want on-pack information about how environmentally friendly the packaging is.

The shift towards greener, more environmentally friendly packaging is gathering momentum. Various commitments are being made by leading brands, manufacturers and retailers to improve the recyclability of packaging and reduce waste.

Such positive moves are being made against a backdrop of the European Commission’s Circular Economy Action Plan. This is designed to make Europe’s economy more sustainable and although it includes a strategy for plastics as well as an existing directive covering packaging and packaging waste, there is no single global or European standard for the design and development of sustainable packaging.

Not-for-profit organisation, the International Safe Transit Association (ISTA), works with member organisations around the globe to optimise packaging performance. It has developed a voluntary standard known as Responsible Packaging by Design (RPbD) to provide companies with a unified step-by-step process to advance sustainable packaging.

ISTA president, A.J. Gruber, explains: “When it comes to sustainability, a lot of focus is placed on the end of the packaging’s journey once it has served its purpose. This is important and it’s great to see widespread efforts to improve packaging recycling, reusability and disposal. However, this is just one stage of the packaging life-cycle.

“Taking a whole life-cycle view of packaging, which considers its performance throughout the supply chain can yield greater energy, resource and carbon emissions savings from the outset. Responsible Packaging by Design provides guidance and a framework to help companies achieve this approach.”

Prioritising packaging performance can prove a more advantageous starting point for companies striving to improve the green credentials of their packaging.

A.J. Gruber outlines the importance of starting with packaging functionality and for sustainable packaging strategies to also embrace financial elements. This is a fundamental element of RPbD and means environmental objectives are considered in full operational context.

“As the European Consumer Packaging Perceptions Survey shows, more and more consumers are demanding sustainable packaging. This demand, along with growing Government and regulatory pressures, can lead to companies homing-in on certain types of materials and building sustainable packaging strategies around these.

“While this can seem a logical starting point, it can mean the most optimal packaging solution is overlooked. This may have an adverse environmental impact as more energy and resource is used to compensate for product damage. Similarly, it can lead to higher volumes of packaging being used during transit, reducing the efficiency of distribution and increasing carbon emissions.

“For these reasons, RPbD does not cover specific material selection or approval methods.”

As well as looking beyond packaging materials, successfully improving packaging sustainability requires collaboration. This helps to balance varying business objectives that tend to exist across different departments and is key to meeting the evolving requirements of consumers, governments and regulatory bodies, NGOs and opinion formers.

A.J. Gruber adds: “Within a business, purchasing may want the lowest cost, manufacturing may demand a solution that’s easiest to run with and has the least changeover and downtime, while marketing wants the latest and greatest innovation. All of these different requirements will be valid and based on satisfying real-world demands.

“Sustainability adds another dimension to such demands and if they’re not met, the packaging solution will not be fully embraced or fit-for-purpose. This can result in inefficiencies and wastage.

“In developing RPbD, we engaged industry, NGOs and governmental experts and during the application of the guidelines, we recommend that stakeholders from marketing, supply chain, R&D, regulatory affairs and manufacturing are actively involved. This ensures packaging functionality and environmental performance are considered from all necessary perspectives.”

With the European Commission’s Circular Economy Action Plan outlining long-term thinking and targets for a more sustainable economy, it seems that for the foreseeable future, packaging sustainability will continue to rank highly on consumer agendas.

This is likely to continue to influence consumer purchasing and the rethinking of packaging strategies. As a final thought, A.J. Gruber suggests that companies wanting to improve packaging environmental performance put the product being packaged at the centre of their packaging plans.

He concludes: “Sustainable packaging strategies must consider the most efficient use of land, water, air, energy, biodiversity and natural resources throughout the whole packaging life-cycle.

“Putting the product being packaged at the heart of a sustainable packaging strategy will achieve this. It will help maximise product protection and cube optimisation during transit. In turn, this will reduce wastage throughout the supply chain and minimise carbon emissions and energy usage.”",United Kingdom,2018.12

The report would represent a shared vision of how collaboration in the plastic value chain will be a driving force of the circular economy in plastics, according to its promoters.

The report ‘Plastics Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda in a Circular Economy’ outlines the research needed to meet the objectives of the EU’s Plastics Strategy, SusChem, Cefic, PlasticsEurope, European Plastics Converters (EuPC) and the European Composites, Plastics and Polymer Processing Platform (ECP4), added.

Plastics consumption and waste production data show that there is “clear room for improvement” in recycling and resource recovery, the groups behind the report say.

Europe uses about 50m tonnes/year of plastics, the report said.

In 2016, 27m tonnes of plastics waste was collected in Europe, with 8.3m tonnes going to recycling facilities and 11.3m tonnes treated for energy recovery.

The report added that 27% of the total plastics used in Europe were sent to landfill.

“The report identifies the challenges to plastics circularity and defines the types of solutions needed to address them. Future research is required in three main areas: Circularity by design, recycling and alternative feedstock,” SusChem said.

SusChem chairman Markus Steilemann, who is also the chairman of Germany's chemicals major Covestro, said that the plastics industry is committed to increase the resource efficiency of its production processes, and to face the challenge of closing the circularity loop.

289,Moving towards the circular economy,"IWA was center stage in a series of events that highlighted a push for innovation in water management, following increasing demand for freshwater and evolved environmental consciousness in China.

It is clear that Chinese water utilities are eager to embrace new technologies for wastewater treatment to serve the increasing freshwater demand. The International Water Association participated at the International Conference on China Urban Water Development and Expo of New Technologies and Facilities, held in Chongqing 29-30 November 2018. This 13th edition of the China Urban Water Conference focused on academic and technological exchange in the field of urban water and water environment comprehensive governance. One of the largest events in the water sector in China, the Conference brought together more than 3000 delegates and 300 exhibitors under the theme “Prevention and control of water pollution and urban water security”.

In his keynote speech at the opening, IWA Executive Director Dr. Kala Vairavamoorthy raised the attention to the current wastewater situation worldwide, as currently over 80% of the world’s wastewater – and over 95% in some least developed countries – is released to the environment without treatment. He stressed the alarming situation that with increasing global change pressures, countries around the world increasingly experience difficulties in efficiently managing scarcer and less reliable water resources.

The demand for water worldwide has increased substantially over the past decades. In China, growing prosperity comes with the challenge to provide 20% of world’s population with safe quality freshwater. This requires advanced treatment technologies, a focus on innovation and advancing technology. With stronger policies favouring the environment, Chinese utilities and industries focus increasingly on embracing new technologies in water and wastewater management. Dr. Vairavamoorthy highlighted that the past 15 years can be seen as a pilot stage for different technologies to be experimented and tested, while the next 20 years will be the golden era for engineering in the provision of wastewater solutions.

“As we are moving towards the circular economy, IWA is keen to accelerate the diffusion of innovation in water, wastewater and sanitation,” Dr. Vairavamoorthy stated. “We have to bridge the gap between academia and practitioners, with the need to generate and transform research much faster into practical implementation”, he urges, and concludes that “IWA looks forward to greater engagement with promising scientists, researchers, technology companies, water utilities and environmental companies in China and around the world to shape a more sustainable future together.”

Mr. Baoxing Qiu, the Counsellor of the State Council of China, former Vice-Minister of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, expressed in his meeting with the IWA representative his high appreciation for the efforts of IWA in catalysing innovation, knowledge and best practice in China and globally. He hopes more water professionals in China can benefit from the IWA network through channels such as the IWA World Water Congress & Exhibition, and the IWA Water & Development Congress & Exhibition, learning products and opportunities of trainings and capacity development.

At the 2018 China Environment Listed Company Summit on 1st December in Zhaoqing, China, organised by China Environmental Chamber of Commerce, Dr. Kala Vairavamoorthy highlighted, that “traditionally, the water sector has relied, almost entirely, on left-brain skills which are geared towards logic, analysis and modelling – predominantly an engineering viewpoint, but the water sector needs leaders who combine their left-brain engineering skills, with right brain creativity and imaginative thinking”.

With IWA being in a pivotal position to support the creation of these new water leaders, IWA members and the IWA Strategy 2019-2024, look forward building up synergies and joining forces to lead the promotion of research towards the invention, development, and diffusion of new technologies and services in the industry on local, national, regional and global level.",Netherlands,2018.12
290,New report explains how business and government can accelerate the circular built environment,"Katowice, Poland, 5 December 2018: Today at COP24 in Poland, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and Circle Economy, in collaboration with Arcadis, released a report describing the changes required for the circular economy to become mainstream in the built environment. The report was developed with ABN AMRO, ArcelorMittal, CRH, DSM, EDGE, Enel, Madaster, Rabobank, Renewi, Saint-Gobain, Bureau SLA, Solvay and Stora Enso.

The “Scaling the Circular Built Environment’’ report explains the way leaders in both business and government can help level the playing field for circular business models, which are currently hindered around the world.
• Remove key financial, legal, technological and political barriers that prevent companies from adopting circular business models
• Ensure companies are able to access the market equally and plan for long-term investment and innovation
• Accelerate the development of relevant regulations and legislations to support new business models under the circular economy
• For both private and public sector to start collaborating across the value chain and start integrating circular principles in standard purchasing practices.

The circular economy presents a huge potential for global economic growth while accelerating society towards a sustainable future and helping to meet the goals of the Paris agreement to mitigate climate change.

Within the built environment the opportunities are evident: this sector consumes over 40% of the world’s yearly extracted resources and it is responsible for a vast environmental footprint that contributes 33% of global carbon emissions.

Moving from a linear model of take-make-dispose to a circular model where buildings, facilities and materials enter a longer lifecycle and reuse model, offers enormous economic and environmental advantages.

However, this transition is hampered by significant barriers that are slowing down the shift in changing roles and business models that are necessary for the transition.

“This report shows the economic opportunity that circular built environment brings to companies in terms of avoided costs, reduced resource risks, and environmental benefits. Circular materials, products and services must become the new normal in buildings. To achieve this, we need bold leadership from companies and policy-makers who can implement solutions to support and scale the circular economy.” said Maria Mendiluce, Managing Director of Climate, Energy and Circular Economy at WBCSD.

“Accelerating the circular built environment can make a considerable contribution to carbon reduction, but it requires a shift in mindset and culture. For this to be effective we need new business models, supported by new valuation methods and standardization, along with new forms of collaboration and co-creation that will help to take the circular economy mainstream. However, companies cannot do this alone. Governments will need to favour circular solutions over business as usual, as this now impedes rapid progress.” Besides that, it is important not to wait and try to make your projects as circular as possible. You already can do a lot, we know out of experience,” said Joost Slooten, Director Sustainability for Arcadis.

The built environment has an oversized environmental footprint. “ We urgently need to accelerate the transition to the circular and low carbon built environment. Governments should develop long-term policies that encourage innovations and investments to bring these to scale. Business needs to adopt new valuation methods, new forms of collaboration and digital innovations to improve information transfer along the building value chain.” said Roy Antink, SVP, International Policy Coordination, Sustainability for Stora Enso.

The circular economy has been estimated as a USD $4.5 trillion opportunity. The paper describes the opportunities, business models and changes that are necessary to leverage this opportunity in the built environment. It also identifies the barriers that are currently hampering the transition and concludes with recommendations to both the public and private sectors on ways to level the playing field and scale the potential of the circular built environment.",Netherlands,2018.12
291,"Blog – Less is more : Designing for a Circular Economy, Lynn Wilson – A&DS","As a recently appointed Architecture and Design Scotland Board Member, textile designer and circular economy design specialist the Materials Library is a key area of interest and importance to me. For a textile designer, there is nothing more interesting than the construction, deconstruction and tactility of a material and its aesthetic and functional properties.

From the circular economy perspective, the environmental impact of raw material extraction and usage needs to be urgently addressed. In 2000, a report from the German Federal Environment Agency (GFEA) found that;

This is interesting because being a design student in the 80s and 90s the doctrine of the day was from another German influence, Bauhaus. The lessons of Mies Van Der Rohe ‘less is more’ has never been more pertinent in the wake of climate change, polluted oceans threatening our fresh water and food chain and the depleting stocks of natural resources. From Scotland’s perspective, Terry A’Hearn, Chief Executive of the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) said;

To achieve this the Scottish Government has taken the lead from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and adopted a circular economy model; Making Things Last – A Circular Economy Strategy for Scotland published in 2016. It is a design driven strategy that interprets the GFEA research;

The end of life of a product and its circular potential to avoid waste is determined by the material choices and the flow of those materials within the supply chain and the impact of the end use. To achieve a circular economy products and services need to be designed to enable materials to be processed multiple times using low impact chemical processing to avoid incineration or landfill.

This is the process of industrial open and closed loops. An interesting example of an open loop using recycled denim can be seen in the Materials Library; insulation made from 85% recycled cotton by Inno-Therm a company that according to their website are a partner in the ReTraCE Project (Realising the Transition to the Circular Economy: Model, Methods and Applications) a European funded project to support cities and regions transition to a circular economy.



Architecture and built environment design professionals have an excellent opportunity to lead by;
• designing out waste at the commissioning stage of a building or masterplan with carefully considered material choices and designed in systems that make it easy to recapture materials at the end of the useful life of a structure
• evaluating the long term impact and use of a building or space and designing to minimise environmental and material impact throughout the life of the structure
• champion new business models by designing buildings and spaces that encourage owners and tenants to collaboratively consume and share high environmental impact goods and services, therefore reducing their impact.
• co design with users when and where possible to ensure buildings and services work and have a low environmental impact such as the design of communal spaces, waste disposal, road access, heating and lighting.
• Ensuring the process of procuring buildings and services is designed with the environment and raw material impact in mind at all times

To help navigate the transition to a circular economy the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and IDEO have collaborated to create The Circular Design Guide. Architects and designers understand the principles of designing more with less and the flexibility and value of materials makes good business sense as well as environmental sustainability. The Materials Library at the Lighthouse and the online resources are an excellent space to research and reflect on how to do this.

Lynn Wilson is currently a PhD in Management researcher at the Adam Smith Business School, Glasgow University funded by the Economic Social Research Council. Her research explores understanding consumer behaviour in relation to the barriers and opportunities of achieving industrial material closed loops to achieve a circular economy.

295,Scottish circular economy to go mainstream,"The Scottish circular economy has gone from theory to practice. With international recognition for our successes to date, it’s now time to go to the mainstream.

The goal of the circular economy is simple – making our precious resources last. But beyond the environmental imperative, there is the equally simple motive of economic opportunity. Scotland recently hosted the Circular Economy Hotspot Scotland, the third in a now annual series of international circular economy business showcases. From 30th October to 1st November, Zero Waste Scotland welcomed delegates from almost 20 different countries to Glasgow, profiling more than 50 Scottish circular economy organisations to an international audience, including policy makers, academics and businesses.

The event marked an important moment in Scotland’s journey towards a circular economy. In 2016, the Scottish Government published its first Scottish circular economy strategy, Making Things Last. We have come a long way in that period of time, investing more than £4m (~€4.5m) through the Circular Economy Investment Fund and giving business support to more than 100 businesses. In 2017, we picked up the award for Circular Economy Nations and Regions from the World Economic Forum at the high-profile Circulars Awards in 2017. Hosting the Hotspot was an acknowledgement of the progress that we have made.

But these achievements pale in significance in comparison to the full potential economic benefits. Putting a figure on those prospects is hard to do, but new analysis gets us a bit closer. Zero Waste Scotland commissioned reports into the economic opportunities of going circular in two of Scotland’s cities and regions – Tayside and Aberdeen & Aberdeenshire. We estimated the potential economic benefits of the Scottish circular economy to be up to £1bn in those two regions alone. Of course, these figures are indicative and there is a huge amount of work to be done if we want to turn that potential into reality.

Scottish businesses are doing great work to make it happen. Zero Waste Scotland was recently in Japan and Indonesia to talk about what Scotland is doing and there is a huge appetite to learn from our experiences. But while we love getting the chance to speak to people about our successes, it’s hard to really bring circular businesses to life when you are standing in front of a PowerPoint in a conference hall. Hosting Circular Economy Hotspot Scotland in Glasgow gave us the chance to turn that dynamic on its head, by bringing a global audience right to Scottish businesses.

Among them was Highland Galvanizers, who hosted an international delegation to discuss their work to extend the safe working life of motorway crash barriers. It is a classic Scottish circular economy vision – reducing harmful emissions while delivering economic savings. The company has pioneered a way of re-coating barriers before rust sets in, so that the steel is preserved and can remain in use for at least another 25 more years. This process is currently being piloted in the south east of Scotland, in partnership with Transport Scotland. This could deliver savings of £4m and 8,200 tonnes of carbon dioxide in the region over the typical barrier lifetime.

Of course, having examples of the Scottish circular economy in action is not enough. We need to make it second nature if its full economic potential is to be realised. That will require a truly transformational shift. We know we are not there yet; and working in collaboration across public and private sectors will be paramount to getting there. Further developing these networks and continuing to build our evidence base will be important, as will funding, and we will continue to provide financial support to help bring circular ideas to market. At the Hotspot, Scotland’s First Minister announced more than £700,000 of investment in circular economy businesses.

One of the businesses to receive funding was Total Homes, a triple-sector partnership undertaking house clearances for Housing Associations in Glasgow, who will be ensuring that household appliances and furniture will re-used. The project is expected to create 15 new jobs and deliver CO2 savings of 2,800 tonnes over three years. But aside from the economic and environmental benefits, it’s a project with a clear social purpose. By recovering and repairing these goods, they can create a source of affordable products, allowing families to kit out their homes for less. Zero Waste Scotland is committed to capturing more of these social benefits, which have all too often been overlooked. Improving how we measure the full benefits of the Scottish circular economy will be key to accelerating its development.

The Scottish circular economy requires across the board change

Ultimately, we want to get to the stage where the circular economy is sufficiently well-embedded that we can simply refer to it as the economy. That means convincing the private sector of the benefits to their bottom line. As the economic opportunities of the Scottish circular economy become clearer, we are seeing the private sector stepping up with funding support. There’s an increasing recognition that this is good business practice. Private backing for Project Beacon – the advanced plastics reprocessing facility being developed in Perthshire – far outstrips the funds put up by the public sector.

Project Beacon pulls together four different businesses to deliver their vision, just one example of collaboration in the Scottish circular economy. Of all the businesses that took part in the Hotspot, there weren’t many that were making it happen on their own. Eliminating waste requires partnership across supply chains, between businesses and across sectors. And Zero Waste Scotland isn’t supporting the Scottish circular economy on our own either. The event was made possible due to the support of the European Regional Development Fund which also part-funds some of the financial support we give to Scottish businesses.

The next Hotspot will be in Belgium; and Catalonia won the competition to hold the 2020 event. It’s clear that the circular economy is going to be high on the agenda for the European Union. From the Circular Economy Package to the European Commission’s plastic strategy, making things last is going to be a key part of any successful economic model in years to come. A recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report suggests that the world is on track to double our current resource use by 2060. This would have huge environmental and social impacts and seriously undermine our chances of meeting the targets set out in the Paris Climate Agreement.

To meet our climate change promises and achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals, it is now widely agreed by policy-makers in many nations that we need a Scottish circular economy. I am proud that Scotland, and our unique industries and businesses, are playing a leading role in showing the way forward.",European Union,2018.12
297,New circular economy Food Producers' Fund to fund Scottish farm efficiency,"Scottish Conservatives has announced it will redirect unspent money from the existing Circular Economy Investment Fund to support farm efficiency and food production. Projects such as anaerobic digestion among those included.

The new Food Producers Fund would drive down costs for rural businesses whilst increasing recycling, energy recovery and maximising value from waste.

The Circular Economy Investment Fund has allocated approximately £5 million so far even though the total funding available to small and medium sized businesses is £18 million.

Maurice Golden, Scottish Conservative shadow environment secretary said: “Our Scottish Conservative food producers fund would give rural communities and farmers the ability to recycle as close to home as possible.

“Indeed, the SNP ban on plastic incineration will leave farmers, particularly those in rural communities, with very few viable options for recycling.

“The Scottish Conservative plan would remove the barriers to recycling that many farmers and rural communities face.

“Simply put, our plan would work with farmers and communities to enable them to recycle and reduce waste; that’s good for all of us.”",United Kingdom,2018.12
300,A new ‘toolkit’ for the European carpet industry to become circular,"Carpet is a significant waste stream, with around 1.6m tonnes arising as waste every year in the European Union (EU). Most carpets are made from finite oil-based plastics – yet it’s estimated that less than 3% of European carpet is currently recycled.

Commissioned by the Changing Markets Foundation, Policy Toolkit for Carpet Circularity in EU Member States aims to ensure that by 2025 all commercial and household carpets, both broadloom and tiles, put on the market pose no health risk, and are separately collected, reusable and fully recyclable.

Aimed at national governments, the toolkit suggests a wide variety of policy instruments with Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) as a key element, and includes both ‘push’ incentives (on the supply side) and ‘pull’ incentives (on the demand side) designed to deliver higher recycling rates in the sector.

“The carpet sector has a unique opportunity to be at the forefront of circular economy, as several companies have shown that they can produce fully recyclable and toxic-free products. Governments must play a key role in this transition by putting in place ambitious policies to ramp up the recycling efforts in the sector. This toolkit provides a blueprint for mandatory policies that will drive investments in better design, collection and recycling of carpets,” said Nusa Urbancic, Campaigns Director at The Changing Markets Foundation.

According to the Changing Markets the toolkit outlines suggested criteria for mandatory eco-design measures (or ‘essential requirements’), including phasing out harmful substances, setting minimum levels for recycled content, recyclability requirements and product passports.

Other policy options set out include a graded ‘Green Carpet Mark’ (similar to the EU energy efficiency label) to help inform consumers about the environmental performance of their carpet, and Green Public Procurement to rapidly increase the market share for better designed and more recyclable products.

“We’re pleased to have brought together our understanding of the issues that currently prevent greater circularity in the sector and our experience in policy design in developing this toolkit. We hope that the toolkit will represent a key step in the move to better environmental performance, from design through to end-of-life management, for all commercial and household carpets,” said Mark Hilton, Head of Sustainable Business at Eunomia.

EPR schemes, whereby producers take responsibility for costs of dealing with their products at the end of life are encouraged by the EU institutions as a way to meet national targets on waste reduction and recycling. While written to guide national policies, many measures outlined in the toolkit could also be effectively applied at the EU level.

The EU is the second largest market for carpets, after the US, and is also one of the largest producers, with an estimated 65% of EU demand for carpets being fulfilled by EU-based companies.

Moving to circular economy has the potential to create even more jobs in this sector and reduce dependency on imported materials.

302,Carpet producers support mandatory action to make the sector go circular,"As a reaction to the Policy Toolkit for Carpet Circularity in EU Member States published by Eunomia on December 4, Zero Waste Europe calls on carpet companies to agree on the vision that by 2025 all commercial and household carpets put on the market should be free of any potentially harmful substance, and should be reusable, separately collected, and fully recyclable.

In order to make this a reality, the sector must phase out hazardous substances and virgin materials, and transition towards safe and healthy components including an increasing rate of recycled or renewable content.

The time is ripe for a Circular Economy for carpets, but this will only happen if a mandatory approach with ambitious policies is adopted. The toolkit proposed by Eunomia provides a range of options that policy-makers can choose from to accelerate circular economy in the carpet sector while, at the same time, helping to achieve the EU waste recycling and landfilling targets.

Zero Waste Europe, DSM-Niaga, Interface and Tarkett support the use of efficient, transparent and well-designed Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes as a way to create the necessary incentives to drive this transition, and commit to support them in the countries considering mandatory measures that allow the carpet sector to go circular.",Germany,2018.12
303,Carpet producers to work together to make the carpet sector circular,"Carpet manufacturers, industry associations and civil society have joined together to make the carpet sector circular, and to urge the European Commission and Member States to adopt mandatory rules to push the industry in this direction.

This call to action follows Eunomia’s report called Policy Toolkit for Carpet Circularity in EU Member States and was launched by Zero Waste Europe (ZWE) and is supported by DSM-Niaga, Interface and Tarkett.

ZWE has called on carpet firms to agree on the vision that by 2025 all commercial and household carpets on the market should be reusable, separately collected, and fully recyclable, and be free of any harmful substance.

To make this happen, the sector must phase out virgin materials, and transition towards safe and healthy components, including an increase in the recycling rate or renewable content, said ZWE.

The organisation believes that a circular economy for carpets is only possible if a mandatory approach with ambitious policies is adopted.

From this, the toolkit proposed by Eunomia provides a range of options that policy-makers can choose from to accelerate a circular economy, while also helping to achieve the EU recycling and landfill aims. This includes:
• Mandatory eco-design measures with minimum essential requirements – provide a minimum five-year warranty, set recycled and content levels, provide ‘product passports’ to assist recyclers and mandate installation techniques to allow easy removal
• Part mandatory without EPR but with incentivised collection.

DSM-Niaga, ZWE, Interface and Tarkett said that they support the use of an efficient, transparent and well-designed EPR scheme as a way to create the necessary incentives to drive the transition and commit to support them in the countries considering mandatory measures that allow the carpet sector to go circular.

ZWE executive director Joan Marc Simon said: “Current legislative and economic frameworks in the carpet sector lock the industry into a wasteful linear system. To build a true circular economy we need new rules and incentives to bring the whole sector to a higher level of ambition. This is why we support the measures proposed in the Eunomia toolkit, and we call on the European Commission and Member States to set the legal framework that will make the carpet sector go circular.”

DSM-Niaga manager strategic growth Lukas Hoex said: “DSM-Niaga is concerned about carpet waste and believes producer responsibility is a big part of the solution. Manufacturers of any kind of product, also carpet, have to design and make products with recycling in mind, and support the collection of products after use. Mandatory disclosure of ingredients is in our view an urgent part of extended producer responsibility, since it supports the consumer to make better choices and the supports recyclers to handle products in the right way.’’",United Kingdom,2018.12
310,Who is ready to do what it takes? - The Malta Independent,"Emergency cleanup on a Saturday by the Ministry for Sustainable Development, the Environment and Climate Change was indeed something that caught my eye when reading the news last weekend.

It is good to see that action is taken when litter is washed ashore, a big well done for that. However, I am not very impressed by their approach to solve the actual core issue.

“We need to face reality and adopt a more circular economy approach while changing our mentality and norms,” Herrera said in the interviews. He also added that after seeing the state of Ghajn Tuffieha it is now more concerning that this will have a severe impact on the environment.

May I remind Herrera that in the waiting area of his ministry, I was offered a plastic single use cup to pour water in from the dispenser. Underneath the dispenser there was a bin with a black bin liner, indicating that it would then end up at the landfill. And even if it would go for recycling, the single use items are often not possible to actually recycle and goes for RDF (refuse derived fuel) and will be burnt. This means that the plastic is taken out of the loop and is not part of a circular economy whatsoever.

Let us also not forget, that the persons working in this field have to be good role models and walk the walk and not only talk. If there is one building that should be plastic free and with several environmental actions in place, it should be the ministry and the minister himself. This is what I miss in Malta and the world. Very few are actually doing themselves what they ask the people to do. Why is it so?

There was a big outcry on social media about the microplastics washed up at Ghajn Tuffieha and I got the impression that people actually aren’t aware that this has happened for years. Every month Gaia Foundation organises a clean up on that same beach and we pick up kilo after kilo of microplastics and this is shared on social media. There are also articles from a decade ago about this issue as well and research done, did the ministry miss this? Why is it suddenly a top priority when we have fought mountains before for anyone to take action?

When the cleanup was over last Saturday, what changes can we expect with immediate effect? Is the ministry willing to do what it takes? Several NGOs have time after time put forward that it’s important to reduce waste and look beyond recycling which at the moment seems to be as far as the plans go at the moment. You see, the microplastic we saw at Ghajn Tuffieha is partly the result of recycling.

We need people at the top management of our country doing what it takes to save our sea and land. We need someone that stands up for sustainability which should be at core of every decision taken, these words have been said by our Prime Minister as well not long time ago.

Yes, we can sit back and clap our hands when politicians put out the fires, but shouldn’t we instead demand that they make sure the fires won’t happen again? Why do we let them, who work for us and not vice versa, get away with greenwashing?

My words may be harsh, but for years I have followed this development and I can clearly see that sustainability is not at core of decisions, not from any angle. It has a very low priority and instead monetary profit in all its forms has a very high one. What we commons need to understand is that this kind of profit is not something we benefit from, only the few does.

I started cleanups nearly a decade ago in Malta but seeing that cleanups won’t solve the issue, I adapted my work to instead spread awareness of the core issue - lack of reducing, while at the same time put the fires out by cleaning up. We commons can create change in mentality, but it will take time which we really don’t have. The few can speed up this process, but it seems like they don’t want to. If the people at the top think that emergency cleanups done by opportunists followed by wise statements will solve this, I am afraid to say that we are doomed.

Malta being a small nation, could be the role model of Europe and reach very high targets but instead we are hiding behind the small size of our nation to do less than others. Where are the firm, passionate and knowledgeable leaders that are willing to set high goals to make Malta into winners?",Malta,2018.12

315,Over 500 objections for waste treatment plant,"OVER 500 comments were submitted online in response to Hills Waste Ltd’s new application for a waste treatment plant in the town.

Northacre Renewable Energy, part of Hills Waste, have resubmitted new plans for an advanced thermal treatment plant, claiming a ‘new and improved’ application with ‘significant benefits compared to existing plans’. However, campaign group ‘Westbury Gasification Action Group’, known as WGAG, called for community action, encouraging people to submit their objections online.

The application for the plant, which was refused by Wiltshire Council in July on grounds of size, received 376 comments. Campaigners are hoping for more objections from members of the public to the renewed application.

A notable objection came from Green Party member of European Parliament for the South West, Molly Scott Cato who wrote, “From my understanding of this new application, little has changed beyond the height of the buildings, so my reasons for objection remain unchanged.

“The council needs to make the bold decision of turning this application down and signal the need to move to a circular economy that produces far less waste that needs this kind of treatment. The plans for this Advanced Thermal Treatment Facility demonstrate an outdated view of tackling waste that will not move us to the circular economy or clean air that citizens deserve now and in the future.”

The majority of the comments against the plans included; Concern of the impact on highways caused by the planned additional HGVs travelling through the area; Potential risks to air quality and public health; Potential nuisances from the site operation; and Negative visual impact of the plant.

Westbury resident, Valerie Madgett wrote, “This incinerator would place an unfair burden on the people of Westbury, for damage to their health and wellbeing by the additional noise, traffic vibrations, dust and flies.

318,Circular Economy Platform established in Hungary,"On November 29, 2018, the Circular Economy Platform was officially established in Hungary as an initiative of the Business Council for Sustainable Development in Hungary (BCSDH), the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and the Ministry for Innovation and Technology.

The establishment of the Circular Economy Platform took place at a ceremony attended by 33 leaders of committed companies, institutions, and organizations, who personally signed the related Memorandum of Understanding. Balázs Weingartner, minister of state for sustainability, praised the initiative, signing the document on behalf of the Ministry for Innovation and Technology.

The BCSDH said that the shift to a circular economy represents a great business opportunity, according to a press release sent to the Budapest Business Journal. While the core of the concept is not yet deeply recognized by most companies, the use of the model can increase the resilience of the world economy and facilitate achievement of the Paris Agreement on climate change and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The circular economy represents a business opportunity worth USD 4.5 trillion by 2030, the council noted.

""The BCSDH and its partners play a prominent role in facilitating the paradigm shift and joint thinking, along with building a community of forward-thinking change leaders and sharing business solutions that make a real impact,"" stressed Attila Chikán Jr., president of the BCSDH. ""For the new model to develop and spread, collaboration and knowledge-sharing are required, with the involvement of businesses, government and science,"" he added.



It is for these reasons that the council announced the establishment of a Circular Economy Platform jointly with the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Ministry for Innovation and Technology, arguing that international and mostly Dutch practices represent well-functioning and important examples that should be followed in this area.

""I am proud that we were one of the first countries to set quantitative targets for a circular economy,"" emphasized René van Hell, ambassador of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Hungary, at the ceremony. ""But this is still not enough for us - we set the bar even higher: the Netherlands is working hard to achieve an economy without waste, an economy that reuses raw materials. We want to have a completely circular economy by 2050.""

""ING Bank considers it a key task to assemble the most important stakeholders who envision a circular economic transition in Hungary at a forum which creates a great place for sharing global experiences,"" stressed Tibor Bodor, CEO of ING Bank N.V.

340,Peer Mountain: a guaranteed trusted environment,"The blockchain technology allows among its many features, the development of trusted environments for all kinds of interactions, including business interactions. Peer Mountain is a platform that is oriented precisely in that direction.

Peer Mountain brings owners of self-sovereign identities closer to service providers that comply with regulations, as it is the first decentralized peer-to-peer trust market, opening new paradigms on how and where individuals and organizations do business.

Peer Mountain is a trusted system designed for mobile devices. It allows people and institutions to create and possess reliable records that cover the digital identity, the relationships of their trust and the test of activities of each account, of course making use of cryptographic protocols.

The community of this app will be able to openly control their data, since their information remains inaccessible and is not exposed to third parties at any time. Peer Mountain developed a cryptographic protection so powerful that the data remains protected from all other entities, including the platform itself.

Peer Mountain is in charge of connecting the holders of ID with sovereigns, with the companies through a chain protocol of crossed blocks, this gives way to the expansion of the commerce and markets on a large scale.

In addition, Peer Mountain is a pioneer in providing organizations with cost-effective regulatory compliance instantly, giving people the power to control all personal information, as well as paying identity verifiers for their reliability.

Peerchain ™ technology encrypts and decentralizes data in all its states, providing companies with regulatory compliance with data protection and button auditing. As a public protocol, Peer Mountain does not define identity for the end user, but instead creates an open trust ecosystem that consolidates all of its identity data into a single digital person.

But Peer Mountain not only provides its users with ownership and control of their cryptographically secure identities, it is also an ecosystem of applications that facilitate commerce and the exchange of digital and physical services quickly and safely for the peace of the community.

In addition, Peer Mountain is an excellent platform to generate additional income through interpersonal interactions, it also allows its clients to create large revenue streams for large companies, making this ecosystem ideal for the growth of certification models. Say, as more and more corporate partners join the circular economy of trust, more opportunities exist to generate income.

Peer Mountain customers can conduct business and sign legally binding documents that comply with ZertES9 because the platform will always be open to any service provider. The community can access the services directly from the source with total security and review all the services they consume easily, at any time of the day and in any place.

The Peer Mountain token (PMTN) is a utility token created to measure the value of reliability within the Peer Mountain ecosystem.

Because Peer Mountain technology is compatible with cross-block chains, entities can use PMTN to move information from one chain to another, for example, from Ethereum to Stellar.

Trusted consumers transfer PMTN to the entities they trust the most. The only way to earn PMTNs is to be reliable and this is verifiable on the platform.

To know more details about this platform we recommend checking its White Paper, and joining at their Telegram channel.",Spain,2018.12

349,Banning plastic could be more harmful to the environment,"An outright ban on plastics could cause even more harm to the environment and lead to triple the amount of greenhouse gas emissions.

That's the finding of experts from Herriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, who say that replacing plastic with alternate materials such as metal and glass won't help the environment.

The team say this is because the manufacturing of these replacements could double global energy consumption.

Resources required to process these replacement materials would lead to more energy consumption and more greenhouse gas.

Campaigners have called for reductions or bans, with recent programmes such as the BBC's Blue Planet highlighting the impact of plastics on the world's oceans.

But the team of forty academics said arguments surrounding a reduction or ban are 'often shortsighted and not based on facts'.

The waste products produced when making metal and glass are all bad for the environment.

The major environmental impact of glass and metal production is caused by atmospheric emissions from melting activities.

The combustion of natural gas/fuel oil and the decomposition of raw materials during the melting lead to the emission of CO2.

Professor David Bucknall, who led the research, said that transportation of consumer goods in plastic packaging means fewer vehicles because plastic is lightweight.

The academics draw expertise from engineering, science, economics and social science, said there needs to be a 'circular economy' for plastic usage.

'Almost everything we touch or interact with on a daily basis is made of or contains a plastic of some description,' said Professor David Bucknall, chairman in materials chemistry from the university's Institute of Chemical Sciences.

'Banning or reducing their use would have a massive impact on the way we live.

'Plastics are lightweight, transportation of consumer goods in plastic packaging means fewer vehicles are required for transportation of those goods.

'Therefore burning less fuel and greatly reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

'So whilst some people may wish for plastics to be reduced or banned altogether, we need to ensure we are replacing them with materials that are better for the planet.

'In many cases there is no credible alternative to using a plastic so we need to move towards a ""circular economy"" for plastics, rather than the largely 'make-use-dispose' model we currently adopt.'",United Kingdom,2018.12
352,Who is connecting the drops on climate change? | Ethical Corporation,"As COP24 climate negotiations open in Katowice Poland, we publish our latest issue, which focuses on how companies are responding to the growing threat to water security from our warming planet

Where are the CEOs who will champion water security, asks CDP’s Cate Lamb in this month’s magazine, as she laments that she can count on one hand the number of corporate leaders who have spoken authentically and competently on the topic, and what it means for their business. (See We can't wait for Al Gore. CEOs have to lean in to the water crisis)

The low level of attention paid to water is all the more stark, given corporate leadership on climate change, to which water insecurity is causally related.

Today nearly half the world’s population has only limited daily access to freshwater, a situation that will get much worse with climate change and rising urbanisation. According to the UN there will be a 40% shortfall in global water availability by 2030.

Water utilities, power stations and agriculture are most vulnerable, but sectors from food and beverages to semiconductors, mining and textiles face disruption if they do not have a reliable, high-quality supply of water.

This month we are devoting the entire magazine to examining how companies are responding to this most pressing of global issues, with nearly half the world’s population living with only limited daily access to freshwater, a situation that will get much worse as the planet warms.

Mark Hillsdon reports on how the urgent need to protect a shared and threatened resource is forcing companies to move away from traditional forms of water management and strike innovative new partnerships with governments and NGOs. (See Rising water risk pushes companies to seek higher ground in collaboration)

He also profiles how drinks companies such as Heineken, Carlsberg and Diageo, which operate in some of the most water-stressed areas of the world, are focusing on circular economy solutions and collaborating to safeguard watershed health. (See Drinks industry thinks outside the box to protect its most precious resource)

Mike Scott reports on how Cape Town’s well-publicised experience of almost running out of water has unleashed an explosion in innovation and investment globally, so that serious money is now starting to flow into solutions to water scarcity and pollution. (See Cape Town crisis unleashes explosion in innovation and investment)

In California, Michael Levitin writes about how some of America’s biggest companies are working together to tackle drought conditions that have contributed to the rapid spread of deadly wildfires, and threaten the country’s biggest source of fresh food. (See Connecting the drops to promote water security in California)

She also looks at innovations to make cotton less water-intensive, and how Levi Strauss is working to reduce water use in manufacturing its jeans with technology it has now made open source.See ‘Water-less’ manufacturing and new cotton irrigation techniques spell hope for brands)

Other companies profiled include Mars Inc, which has been working in partnership with WWF, UN Environment and the International Rice Research Institute to substantially reduce water use in rice cultivation (How Mars Food is helping to slash water use in rice cultivation), and India’s Mahindra Group, which used its 2% mandated CSR levy to develop an integrated watershed management programme in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh (Mahindra plots green revolution in central India).

WaterAid’s Jonathan Farr has the final word, arguing that one clear message from the latest IPCC report is that, with a minimum of 1.5C increase in global temperatures locked in, it’s time to get serious about spending on adaptation. And business and investors will play a vital role. (See 'We need to pour money into water infrastructure, or we are all sunk')

While they had a busy schedule together on the first two days of the tour, they had a separate agenda for most of their third day in the country. Queen Mathilde’s programme focused on sustainable development.

She first attended the ‘Innovative solutions for the circular economy, sustainable mobility and climate change’ seminar that was held on the UGent Campus in Icheon. There, she met with former Secretary General of the UN, Ban Ki-Moon and his wife, Yoo Soon-taek. In 2016, Ban Ki-Moon appointed Queen Mathilde as a Sustainable Development Goals Advocate.

Afterwards, Queen Mathilde visited the Smart City Operation Centre in Icheon which is the first smart city of South Korea before getting back to Seoul. There she visited UNICEF Korea’s headquarters and met with children to talk about sustainable development. The conversation focused on how they see their future and how they want to contribute to achieving the SDGs. Queen Mathilde is Patron of UNICEF Belgium.

In the evening, King Philippe and Queen Mathilde reunited to host a concert and a reception for the President of South Korea and his wife. The concert was performed by three former laureates of the Queen Elisabeth Competition. The next day, King Philippe and Queen Mathilde spent their final hours in South Korea visiting the Jeon Jin Sang Medical Centre which was founded by Dr Marie-Helene Brasseur who is from Belgium in 1975. They also opened the Belgian Life Festival before splitting again for the last events of the state visit. King Philippe attended an investment lunch with Korean and Belgian investors while Queen Mathilde participated in a lunch on mental health at the Jingwansa Temple.

372,Sé previews monolithic Beneath the Heavens furniture series by Ini Archibong,"A throne-like desk chair and a sofa for fantasising on are among pieces launching as the second part of Ini Archibong's collection for furniture brand Sé.

The 11 new additions, by the Nigerian-American designer who is based in Switzerland, complete the 22-piece collection, the first half of which was debuted last year.

The second instalment will be showcased within the brand's usual spot at Spazio Rossana Orlandi during Milan design week, which takes place later this month.

Its name, Below The Heavens, makes reference to Archibong's inspiration for both parts of the collection, which he said is ""the eternal interplay between heaven and earth"".

While Part I focused more on celestial bodies and sky-gazing, Part II is inspired by terrestrial and monumental elements.

""Here, I was particularly inspired by the monolithic shapes of standing stones,"" said Archibong. ""The new part of the collection builds upon this theme.""

Described by the brand as statuesque and mature, Part II includes lighting, glassware, seating and tables and the pieces feature updated wood finishes as well as bespoke crystal colours.

The streamlined Oshun Sofa is named after a Yoruba deity that acts as an intermediary between humankind and the spiritual, known as an Orisha – specifically the deity of love and pleasure.

Upholstered in fabric and leather with a base made from brass, the sofa is designed to offer a ""heavenly landing on earth"". It's available with one or two back cushions as either a sofa or daybed.

""It's a bit like a grounded cloud,"" Archibong told Dezeen. ""I think of it as a seat for reposing, thinking and fantasising – a place for personal escape.""

The brand's existing Moirai chandelier is joined by a matching series of crystal glass lamps and vessels which are mouth-blown and hand-finished in Switzerland.

For the new table and floor lamps, which feature brass stems and bases, the brand has developed new crystal colours that fade from coloured to clear glass across the full range of shades.

Made from solid oak and inspired by standing stones, the throne-like Atlas desk chair is stained by hand.

""Upholstered with a high headrest, back pad and seat, the Atlas Desk Chair has the look of a sentinel and a scale that gives the sitter a superb vantage point,"" explained Archibong. ""This is a chair that offers a ringside seat on the world.""

Designed for use both indoors and outdoors, and available with or without arms, the Circe sofa is a playful take on Shaker style according to the London-based brand.

Although the design originally launched last year, the brand has developed a new version that features interchangeable cushions allowing customers to play with colour combinations.

""In the same family as the Lounge Chair, the Circe Sofa welcomes the spiritual traveller back to earth,"" said Archibong. ""There is a hint of classicism and a touch of American design history in the Shaker-like vertical supports, providing roots for this futuristic design that incorporates three different upholstered areas.""

Also launched last year, the cantilevered Eos table is now available in solid oak with stains that have been hand-selected and in some cases developed exclusively for Sé.

Other launches happening at Milan Design Week include an expansive homeware collection by Architect André Fu, furniture, lamps and jewellery by designers from Norway, which demonstrate sustainable design and the circular economy, and a permanent restaurant and showroom called The Manzoni by designer Tom Dixon.

The move, designed to protect vulnerable wildlife and reduce the amount of waste generated, is part of a planned $290 million spend by Labor aimed at making Australia cleaner for future generations.

""Plastic has a devastating impact on our natural environment - more than a third of the world's sea turtles were found to have plastic waste in their stomachs, and it is estimated around 90 per cent of seabirds eat plastic waste,"" a joint statement from Opposition Leader Bill Shorten, Labor Senators Penny Wong and Kim Carr and environment spokesman Tony Burke said on Sunday.

If Labor wins government they will consult with states, territories and industry on how best to introduce the ban, which the party said would create consistency after many jurisdictions moved to phase out plastic bags.

Other planned initiatives include a national container deposit scheme, a $60 million national recycling fund, the appointment of a national waste commissioner, and $15 million to help neighbouring countries clean up the Pacific Ocean.

""Australians want action from government to help reduce waste and build a circular economy,"" the Opposition's statement said.

""So while many Australians do their duty - they recycle, compost, use keep cups for their morning coffee - we need the government to take a leading role to tackle some of the big, structural problems.""",United Kingdom,2019.03
379,Lights start to go off around the world to mark Earth Hour,"More than 100 landmarks across the UK will switch off their lights to mark this year's Earth Hour, joining others from around the world. From Buckingham Palace to Edinburgh Castle, lights on famous buildings and structures across the UK will be switched off between 8.30pm and 9.30pm tonight as part of an international event organised by conservation charity WWF to urge action to save the planet. Sydney Opera House, Egypt’s Great Pyramids, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, Brazil’s Christ the Redeemer monument and the Empire State Building in New York are among the sites worldwide where the lights will be switched off. Photographs began flooding social media as it turned 8.30pm in New Zealand and Australia.

The event sees landmarks, businesses and people switching their lights off for an hour of darkness, and aims to highlight the impacts humans are having on the planet through climate change, pollution, plastic and food production. More than 7,000 cities in more than 170 countries and millions of people are expected to take part this year, to send a message to leaders that protecting the Earth should be top of their agenda, WWF said. In the UK, the Houses of Parliament, the London Eye and the Shard, Cardiff Castle, Liverpool Cathedral, Old Trafford, Brighton Pier and the Eden Project are among the landmarks taking part.

Options include restoring nature in your neighbourhood, planning a holiday closer to home, washing clothes at 30 degrees or changing the way you eat. The charity is encouraging people to pledge personal actions as part of this year’s Earth Hour, such as turning the washing machine down to 30C, avoiding single-use plastics, planning a staycation or holiday nearer to home, changing the way they eat or helping restore nature in their local area.

Last year across the UK, 10 million people took part, along with more than 7,000 schools, 400 landmarks and thousands of businesses and organisations, the charity said. WWF warns that people living today are the first generation to experience the effects of climate change, and the last to be able to change it - while the planet is also suffering plastic pollution and deforestation. This year, as well as switching off for an hour, the environmental charity is asking people to make a pledge to change one thing in their lives that will help protect the planet.

The Metropolitan Police Service will also be taking part again, stopping its iconic revolving sign outside New Scotland Yard and switching off lights ""where it is operationally feasible"".

386,Scrap Metal Sorting & Battery Recycling Key Topics at Automotive Recycling Event,"This year's International Automobile Recycling Congress (IARC) which took place in Vienna, Austria, saw some 220 experts from 24 countries came together to discuss the latest industry.

With the automotive industry currently undergoing many radical changes, the event featured the in-depth discussion of a number of topics.

The pressure to cut carbon emissions is driving the development of lightweight design and electric mobility, but posing major challenges for the recycling industry, particularly when it comes to finding ways to recycle new types of composite materials. However, opportunities are also emerging from this development, as the overarching aim of reducing carbon emissions is also increasingly shining a spotlight on the recycling industry.

In his keynote speech on ‘Mobility's Circular Economy Potentia’, Patrick Schaufuss from McKinsey & Company, Inc. emphasised just how great the recycling industry's potential is. His speech also provided the basis for the subsequent panel discussion titled ‘Opportunities of the Circular Economy’. The McKinsey consultant appealed to the automotive industry and other players to give greater consideration to designs that are suitable for the circular economy right from the outset.

Fittingly, Jean-Denis Curt presented the Renault automotive group's circular ecosystem and the closed recycling loops it has introduced. Niklas Kilberg from the Volvo Car Corporation spoke about the measures the Swedish car company has taken to promote sustainability and also presented Volvo's strategy for handling plastics.

Further lectures were held on the key topic of electric mobility and the challenges it poses. For example, Dirk Spiers from the US company Spiers New Technologies presented the ""Life Cycle Management of xEV Batteries in Practice"". Charles Stuyck also held a talk on the importance of recycling to support the growth of EVs. In the same vein, Johann Prammer presented technology trends for processes and materials in the steel industry between now and 2050.

Another topic of focus at this year's IARC was the latest technological developments in sorting and classifying scrap metal. Lorenzo Bacchetti from the Italian company Danieli Centro Cranes introduced the automatic scrap yard, where scrap is classified with the help of artificial intelligence.

The technical lectures were accompanied by country reports from Argentina, Germany and India, which pointed out the challenges that individual countries are facing in the field of automobile recycling. Finally, Artemis Hatzi-Hull from the European Commission presented the current state of the planned revision of the EU End-of-Life Vehicles Directive.

A total of 24 presentations were held on the two days of the conference. The program was accompanied by a trade exhibition that gave congress attendees the opportunity to find out about new products, services and technologies. A total of 21 exhibitors had stands at this year's congress.

Furthermore, on the third day, plant tours were on offer to visit the companies Scholz Austria Group in Laxenburg and voestalpine Stahlwelt in Linz. Next year, the congress will be held in Geneva to coincide with the Geneva International Motor Show. The event will take place from March 11 to 13, 2020.

390,Europe free from single use plastic in 2 years,"Urgent action is needed to safeguard the biodiversity of the world’s forests amid alarming rates of deforestation and degradation, according to the latest edition of The State of the World’s Forests released today.

Published on the International Day for Biological Diversity (22 May), the report shows that the conservation of the world’s biodiversity is utterly dependent on the way in which we interact with and use the world’s forests.

The report was produced by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in partnership, for the first time, with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and technical input from the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC).

It highlights that some 420 million hectares of forest have been lost through conversion to other land uses since 1990, although the rate of deforestation has decreased over the past three decades.

The COVID-19 crisis has thrown into sharp focus the importance of conserving and sustainably using nature, recognizing that people’s health is linked to ecosystem health.

Protecting forests is key to this, as they harbour most of the Earth’s terrestrial biodiversity. This report shows that forests contain 60,000 different tree species, 80 percent of amphibian species, 75 percent of bird species, and 68 percent of the Earth’s mammal species.

FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020, noted in the report, found that despite a slowing of the rate of deforestation in the last decade, some 10 million hectares are still being lost each year through conversion to agriculture and other land uses.

“Deforestation and forest degradation continue to take place at alarming rates, which contributes significantly to the ongoing loss of biodiversity,” FAO Director-General, QU Dongyu, and the Executive Director of UNEP, Inger Andersen, said in the foreword.

The report presents a comprehensive overview of forest biodiversity, including world maps revealing where forests still hold rich communities of fauna and flora, such as the northern Andes and parts of the Congo Basin, and where they have been lost.

In this report, a special study from the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission and the US Forest Service found 34.8 million patches of forests in the world, ranging in size from 1 hectare to 680 million hectares. Greater restoration efforts to reconnect forest fragments are urgently needed.

As FAO and UNEP prepare to lead the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration from 2021 and as countries consider a Global Biodiversity Framework for the future, Qu and Andersen both expressed their commitment for increased global cooperation to restore degraded and damaged ecosystems, combat climate change and safeguard biodiversity.

“To turn the tide on deforestation and the loss of biodiversity, we need transformational change in the way in which we produce and consume food,” said QU and Andersen. “We also need to conserve and manage forests and trees within an integrated landscape approach and we need to repair the damage done through forest restoration efforts.”

The report notes that the Aichi Biodiversity Target to protect at least 17 percent of the Earth’s terrestrial areas by 2020 has been achieved for forests, although progress is still required to ensure the representativeness and effectiveness of such protection.

A study conducted by UNEP-WCMC for this report shows that the largest increase in protected forest areas occurred in broadleaved evergreen forests – such as those typically found in the tropics. Furthermore, over 30 percent of all tropical rainforests, subtropical dry forests and temperate oceanic forests are now located within protected areas.

391,Disposable plastic ban approved: retail calls for joint effort,"Disposable plastic items such as straws, cutlery, plates or cotton swabs will be banned in the EU a little more than two years from now. EuroCommerce responds by pointing out that everyone involved will have to contribute to make that goal succeed.

EU becomes ""global leader in dealing with litter""

Last May, Europe declared war to litter, mostly targeting disposable plastic. In December, the EU reached a political agreement on a ban on disposable plastic packaging, straws, cutlery and plates, cotton swabs and even balloon sticks. That political agreement has now been approved by the European parliament with a large majority (560 in favour and 35 opposed).



Two years from now, disposable plastic will be banned throughout the entire EU. And that's not all. The new regulation forces manufacturers of cigarette filters, balloons and candy wrappers to contribute in the cleanup and reprocessing costs of litter. Plastic bottlecaps will have to be attached to the bottles and from 2025 onward, plastic bottles will have to consist of at least 25% recycled material (30% by 2030).



Simultaneously, as many as 90% of all plastic bottles will have to be collected separately by 2029. That should put Europe on the road to becoming ""the world leader in dealing with litter"" according to satisfied EU vice-president Frans Timmermans.

Eurocommerce, the European trade interest group, points out in a response that the retail industry is already actively reducing the amount of plastic in its stores and supply chain and that many members have already solemnly promised to ban unnecessary disposable plastic items and to pursue more recycling as well as innovative ways to tackle the issue.



""We are as a sector already actively doing our bit in reducing plastic waste,"" stated Christian Verschueren, general manager of EuroCommerce, ""but to do so effectively we need consistent implementation, and the engagement of the whole supply chain and public authorities to achieve real reductions in single-use plastic and marine litter. Without a proper waste management infrastructure and sufficient recycling facilities we will not achieve a circular economy or the objectives of this directive.” EuroCommerce is calling for the European Commission to seriously pursue clear and coherent rules on certain crucial elements such as the definition of disposable plastic and the cost of cleaning and processing.",European Union,2019.03
396,Position paper - Boosting the circular economy by speeding up waste shipment procedures in the EU - 27.03.2019,"The Waste Shipments Regulation (WSR) is a vital piece of legislation. The EU guarantees free movement of goods, services and people. It has strict rules in place to ensure that not only waste shipments are safe and traceable, but also that the waste is properly treated at its final destination. The Regulation unfortunately is implemented by the Member States with largely differing enforcement rules. Consequently, the shipments of wastes for recycling are often hampered resulting in counterproductive results. In order to ensure a smooth functioning of EU waste markets, an update of the Regulation, which guarantees the implementation of harmonized rules and procedures across the EU Member States is vital for the completion of the EU Circular Economy. Particularly the improvement of notification procedures of waste shipments to compliant recycling facilities, producing secondary raw materials, offers huge potential. A first Fast-Track Notification pilot project has been successfully approved within 19 working days and testifies of the benefits of speeding up notification procedures, in line with Article 14 of the Regulation.

403,Global action needed to tackle rising tide of e-waste,"The world needs to co-operate to counteract the growing problem of electronic waste (e-waste), a new collaborative study has concluded.

The study, conducted by researchers from the UK as well as the USA and China, found that toxic e-waste is being shipped around the world illegally or sent to countries with unsafe or underdeveloped recycling facilities.

The authors of the paper said they hoped to shine a light on how recycling could be improved to allow e-waste to become part of the circular economy.

Professor Lenny Koh, director for the Centre of Energy, Environment and Sustainability at the University of Sheffield, said: ‘E-waste can be turned into ‘gold’ and can contribute to the circular economy if it is handled effectively, efficiently and sustainably, thereby avoiding negative impacts on health and the environment.’

E-waste, which concerns electronic waste such as old mobile phones, computers, and circuit boards – is growing rapidly with almost 45 million metric tonnes recorded in 2016.

E-waste often contains toxic components, making it potentially hazardous both to human beings and the natural environment.

However, equipment capable of recycling e-waste efficiently is at present highly expensive, with current preventative measures such as the UN’s Basel Convention unable to cope with the issue.

The researchers behind the study say that international co-operation and the private sector could play a vital role in sharing the skills and technology to handle e-waste and making them more widely available.

Increased government oversight and financial incentives such as those offered by Indian banks towards sustainable development in rural regions may also help the e-waste industry, they say.

Professor Koh added: ‘Accessible best available technologies, sustainable standards for e-waste recycling, and financial incentives will pave the way forward for global actions in solving the e-waste challenge.

‘Our research and recommendations shown in this paper can be used directly by governments and industry globally in designing e-waste recovery and circular economy models and policy.’

The news comes as a report earlier this week said that the UK recycling industry is ‘creaking’, largely due to it being designed in a pre-e-commerce era.

The UK currently has a recycling rate of 45.2%, well below the EU’s target of 50% by 2020 and 55% by 2025.",United Kingdom,2019.03
404,"B-Stock | Supporting the circular economy is the key to cutting environmental damage and maintaining customers, says B-Stock","Despite reports questioning the overall stability of the retail industry, businesses are continuing to thrive with e-commerce sales and fast fashion brands on the rise. The consequence of this growth, however, is that the volume of waste produced is escalating, most significantly from returns and excess stock that often end up in a landfill or destroyed due to retailers being unable to shift the products elsewhere.

Growing competition in the industry to make returns cheap and easy for consumers has resulted in an unprecedented number of items being returned, says B-Stock, the world’s leading auction platform for returned, excess and other liquidation inventory.

Online shoppers typically return around 30 per cent of the goods that they buy (compared to 8 per cent for in-store shoppers). Globally, the value of returned and excess inventory exceeds $1.2 trillion per year.

In the UK, 300,000 tonnes of clothing are sent to landfill every year - this includes garments that have never been worn or used. There is a pressing need to find a viable solution for retailers to quickly and easily alleviate this waste, in a way that will not further cut into their profits.

“Returns and excess stock contribute heavily to the amount of waste that retailers produce. With the environment facing the risks that it currently is, it is vital that we work together to change these outdated practices and instead utilise methods that will allow us to make a significant change,” said Ben Whitaker, B-Stock’s EMEA Director. “Supporting the circular economy is so important for companies in the current retailing climate, especially where brand ethics and transparency are increasingly affecting consumer’s purchasing decisions.”

There are alternative solutions for retailers, such as marketplace platforms that allow retailers to sell their returned and excess stock to thousands of business buyers, as opposed to being sent straight to landfill.

Whitaker added “There are so many opportunities now for retailers to shift stock in a way that is not only offsets loss, but more importantly, reduces the strain on the environment. Online auction platforms like the ones B-Stock operates allow retailers to sell their unwanted stock for maximum value in a controlled dynamic.”

By reworking traditional methods and replacing them with a new viable solution in the form of an online B2B liquidation marketplace, organisations have the potential to ethically repurpose and resell millions of items and in turn, alleviate wastage and landfill strain.

B-Stock is exhibiting at Internet Retailing EXPO at booth H5, NEC, Birmingham, 3-4 April 2019.

414,COMMENT: Keep It Simple When it Comes to Kerbside Recycling Collections,"Richard McKinlay, Axion’s Head of Circular Economy, has called for residential kerbside recycling collections tp focus on consistent quality if the UK is to boost plastics recycling rates and meet current targets.

According to McKinlay, Investment in infrastructure is also needed to enable the collection of a wider range of plastic packaging at the kerbside as that is the only way to achieve the volumes required for successful recycling.

The UK Plastics Pact, which aims to deliver a circular economy for plastics, sets out four defined targets by 2025 to tackle the issue of plastic waste across the entire supply chain. Key targets state that 70% of plastics packaging is effectively recycled or composted with a 30% average recycled content across all plastic packaging.

McKinlay said: “While it’s good to have ambitious targets, without a shift in focus and investment in infrastructure, these targets won’t be reached.

“In the UK we are using the existing infrastructure which was designed around the economics of recycling. In Belgium, they have taken a decision that their existing facilities are no longer fit for purpose and have invested in multiple new plants to recycle plastic packaging. This radical step change is likely the only way to achieve our targets.

“Consumers are being bombarded with new bespoke collection scheme options. While these models work well for businesses, they are not always suitable for consumers and few are likely to participate. We need to recycle at the kerbside and keep it simple to avoid confusion.

“Communicating that packaging needs to be empty, not stacked, not contaminated and crushed, where possible, rather than focusing on the particular types of packaging could yield higher volumes of material at a higher quality.

“Our existing recycling facilities were designed some time ago and based around the value of materials then, such as PET and HDPE bottles. Trying to process different materials as well, such as PTT is not going to work and results in lower quality outputs, that end up being exported.

“The aim of recycling is changing from being a profitable business in its own right to tackling the growing volumes of waste and a desire to recycle. Through Extended Producer Responsibility the economic landscape will change, and so must the infrastructure.”

With markets in the Far East closing their doors to UK-exported mixed plastic waste, McKinlay argued that the focus should be on the consistent quality of collected materials for recycling. Hence the need to invest in plants capable of sorting all packaging formats collected at the kerbside to achieve volumes to justify the investment in recycling infrastructure.

“In addition to consistency in collections, a consistent process design for sorting plants should also be considered. This would entail all facilities being built to a basic, common specification and using certain processes to achieve a standard specification of output, or, preferably, better.

“Consumers will become fatigued with the ever growing list of bespoke collection schemes for niche products, which collect minimal tonnage in an inefficient manner. Instead the focus should be on enabling the collection of all packaging at the kerbside, ensuring as much packaging as possible is designed for recycling and sorting this into fractions which can be recycled.”

415,UNIC-Italian Tanneries invests in Sicit’s circular economy - Leather International,"UNIC-Italian Tanneries, the most important and most organised association of the tanning industry at a global level, has acquired, through its subsidiary Lineapelle, a quota of SprintItaly. The latter, which will control SICIT with an acquisition operation, will set the newly-acquired business to be quoted on the AIM Italia of the Italian Stock Exchange. The ownership of Gruppo UNIC – Lineapelle will be of about 2% of the total capital and will include voting rights on the new company once the acquisition is complete.

UNIC represents around 1,200 businesses, all together employing circa 18,000 people and a combined revenue of about 5 billion euro, 76% of which originates from exports. The Italian tanning industry is an historic and consolidated example of circular economy, due to the fact that it utilizes large quantities of the meat industry’s waste (animal remains) so that it doesn’t go to waste, thus reducing the environmental impact and creating a worthy product that has very high-level technical performances that last throughout time.

“The acquisition of a part of Sicit’s capital is proof of our trust in the future of the segment, as well as being a core part of the strategic goals of the association, influential and vigilant travel companion to Italian tanners during their journey towards the continuous development of their sustainability practices, with always-larger investments”, stated Gianni Russo, president of UNIC-Italian Tanneries and Lineapelle.

“The investment made by UNIC – Italian Tanneries represents an important endorsement for Sicit’s green entrepreneurial model, which makes us proud and can only reassure the financial markets with regards to the goodness of their investment. Moreover, this decision testifies the quality of the work we have done throughout the years, which has allowed us to further strengthen our presence on international markets”, commented Massimo Neresini, CEO of SICIT.

As of right now, Sicit is completing the business combination process with SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) SprintItaly: an operation worth 100 million euro that will allow the company (Sicit) to accelerate its strategic growth plan both in Italy and abroad, which includes the upgrade of the existing sites in Arzignano and Chiampo (Vicenza, Italy), the expansion of the R&D lab and the construction of a new production site in South America. At the end of this growth plan, SICIT will be quoted on the AIM Italia stock market (small caps), and it plans on starting, while considering the necessary time and steps, the process to move to the MTA (Mercato Telematico Azionario) which is for medium and large caps.",United Kingdom,2019.03

430,Glasgow circular economy event to showcase sustainable building,"Circular Glasgow is bringing one of the world’s most sustainable buildings to the city centre as part of an informative hub that inspires a rethink, reuse, repair and recycle approach.

Circular Hub, an exhibition that uses only repurposed or recycled materials, will be set up in St. Enoch Square from 10am until 5pm on Saturday March 30.

The free to visit event will be filled with information on ways to become more circular and includes; case studies of pioneering local organisations who have successfully adopted a more sustainable approach, information on Glasgow’s circular journey, inspiring ‘did you know’ facts and stats in addition to an interactive area that encourages visitors to share simple ideas and tips.

There will also be a ‘Simple Swap Wheel’ which invites visitors to commit to at least one easy to achieve swap within their day to day life such as; drinking tap water rather than bottled water, composting food waste rather than throwing it away or buying locally rather than online. Those who make a pledge will be encouraged to share their goal on social media in the hope that others will also be inspired to take action.

Circular Hub will include real life examples of products that have been designed with circularity in mind. The St. Enoch Centre’s waste coffee grounds to compost initiative will be showcased through the centre’s plants and will be joined by a special eco-friendly flower bed from Kabloom. The hub itself has been designed by IndiNature, who manufacture 100% plant based construction systems, while all of the information boards have been created using recycled planks from Glasgow Wood Recycling or G. F. Smith’s Extract paper made from used coffee cups.

Circular Glasgow, a Glasgow Chamber of Commerce initiative in partnership with Zero Waste Scotland and funded by the European Regional Development Fund, works with companies across the city helping them to open up new revenue streams, increase competitive advantage and realise financial savings using a range of practical tools.

Following its work within the business community, Circular Glasgow now hopes to inspire the public to think about small simple steps that can be taken to move towards Glasgow’s goal of becoming one of the world’s leading circular cities.

Alison McRae, senior director at Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, said: “There are lots of small and simple changes that can be made to create a more sustainable way of life, and as we all begin to take these steps we can work towards our circular goal with enough resources for everyone forever.

“We’ve had great success stories over the last couple of years among Glasgow’s business community, and we’re thrilled to now be able to share that journey with the rest of the city with the hope of inspiring change.

“Glasgow is a city that pulls together like no other, and as we continue to do so, we can help our city adapt and grow through innovative ideas that prepare us for the future.”

Anne Ledgerwood, general manager at St. Enoch Centre, said: “We can’t wait for the arrival of the Circular Hub, it’ll be a fantastic feature which our shoppers can enjoy and hopefully be inspired by.

“It’s great to be involved in the project with our coffee activity which sees waste coffee grounds from retailers within St. Enoch turned into fertiliser for plant compost used throughout the centre – helping illustrate how even small changes can make a big difference.

“The hub will provide an excellent source of inspiration to people across Glasgow, encouraging us all to become more circular and reap the rewards environmentally and financially - all whilst leading the way towards Glasgow’s goal of becoming one of the world’s leading circular cities.”",United Kingdom,2019.03

The study examined the residual waste treatment capacity of 14 countries at risk of missing the 2020 targets for reuse and recycling and suggests that most countries may still be on time to develop their waste management system in line with the circular economy by 2035.

Zero Waste Europe development and policy coordinator Janek Vahk said: “The circular economy objectives are not a goal, but rather a minimum standard, and Member States can and should go beyond them. It is crucial that EU cohesion funds support them on this path, instead of financing antiquated technologies that send recyclables up in smoke.”

The report also showed that countries including Estonia, Finland and Poland, which are overinvesting in infrastructures such as incinerators, might end up with an overcapacity in residual waste treatment, which will discourage them from increasing the circular economy targets.

A case study published by Zero Waste Europe in January this year also found how the presence of incineration plants in Madeira and Azores is discouraging waste separate collection and recycling on the islands.

Jim Hardisty, managing director of Goplasticpallets.com, said: “Not only do we stock the largest range of plastic pallets, pallet boxes and small containers in the UK, all of our products are available in large volumes – our customers need not worry about supply shortages.

“Our plastic pallets and boxes can be reused time and time again; recycled once they reach the end of their working life; then the recycled plastic can be fed back into the manufacturing process to create new, high quality, reusable plastic pallets and boxes – closing the loop and creating a circular economy.”

Following the company’s pledge last month to recycle all of its customers’ plastic pallets and boxes, Goplasticpallets.com has had a lot of interest in its recycling scheme. But a question they’re frequently being asked is how exactly does it work?

Hardisty explained: “We’ve tried to make it as simple as possible for our customers to recycle their plastic pallets and boxes. Depending on the volume that customers wish to recycle, they can choose from one of our two recycling solutions.

“For volumes in excess of 1500kg, customers can take advantage of our hassle-free collection service, where we will arrange a collection and transport the products straight to our partner’s recycling facility in Belgium.

“Customers can arrange for smaller loads to be dropped off at our warehouse at their own convenience, where once consolidated we will transport in full truck loads to Belgium – ensuring our trucks are running at their maximum efficiency.

“Our partner’s recycling factory in Belgium is one of only three in Europe with a pallet recycling facility adjacent to the manufacturing plant, and is the closet one to the UK. By recycling our customers’ plastic pallets and boxes in Belgium we guarantee that they will not only be ethically recycled by a fully licensed facility, but also that the recovered material will be reused to make the next wave of high quality, long life plastic pallets and boxes.”",United Kingdom,2019.03

446,Outcome kick-off meeting SedNet WG Sediments in Circular Economy | SedNet,"The first question asked by operators and stakeholders is “we would like to reuse dredged sediments instead of dumping,

 but which are the technically feasible options, are they acceptable from the regulatory and social point of view, and which is their cost?”

If a reuse option is identified and acceptable, how far has it been used, is it really demonstrated, what are the possible pitfalls, are there any good practice guides ? What is the level of risk involved if we chose Reuse and CE instead of Business as Usual?

Systemthinking: To change a system (f.i. to improve reuse of sediment) you have to look for underlying root causes. Just like an iceberg, 90% of which is invisible beneath the water, these root causes are often hidden below the surface. However, if you can identify them and connect them to the events that you are seeing, you may be able to develop lasting solutions that target the whole system rather than short term, reactive solutions.

A large part of dredged sediments is fine-grained or extremely fine grained (clay, mud). In civil engineering applications, there are more needs for coarse sediment or sand than for mud. Mud can be agglomerated to build coarser materials. Agglomeration has a cost (energy, binders,…). A sustainability analysis of this process is needed.

454,Alarm sounded for urgent action on climate change at RBS New York | Ethical Corporation,"Terry Slavin reports on the second day of this week’s conference, with the assistant secretary-general of UN Environment warning that companies must go far beyond adhering to the Paris Agreement

The urgent need for decarbonisation was a theme that ran through day two of Responsible Business Summit New York.

In his opening keynote address Satya Tripathi, assistant secretary-general of UN Environment, congratulated companies like Cisco, Apple and Google and those represented at the conference. “You are all pursuing sustainability in one way or another, or you wouldn’t be here, part of this conversation. So more power to you.”

But he poured cold water on the Paris Agreement on climate change, which many companies have aligned their climate action with, warning that it has “lulled us into a false sense of comfort that the world will change course and we’ll all be fine. We will not be fine.”

Even if all signatories followed up on their promises, the world would be on track for 3.2C of global warming by the end of the century, according to UNEP’s latest annual Emissions Gap report. This is far in excess of the 1.5C that last year’s IPCC report identified as the threshold for dangerous warming.

“Everything we love, whether it’s the environment, air, water, everything we know and allow is about to disappear and we don’t realise it,” Tripathi said in his emotional address.

“Martin Luther King used to say ‘I have a dream.’ He didn’t say ‘I have a nightmare’. He lived that nightmare, but he didn’t say it, because no one would listen to him,” Tripathi said.

“We really need to take a hard look at ourselves and how we live our lives. …. The balance that has been achieved over billions of years, which led to the appearance of life forms, we are tinkering beyond understanding.”

UNEP's Satya Tripathi: 'Paris has lulled us into a false sense of comfort.'

He added that the time of investing billions in adaptation and mitigation of climate change is over. “It needs intervention at the trillions scale.”

He said public finance should be used to leverage private finance, as UNEP has done with the Tropical Landscapes Finance Facility in Indonesia, in partnership with BNP Paribas, which the conference heard from the previous day, Hong Kong-based ADM Capital, and the World Agroforestry Centre. Within a year the facility has generated a $5bn pipeline of projects to protect forests, including the world’s largest sustainable rubber plantation.

The same partners have also launched a similar facility, the Sustainable India Finance Facility, investing $2.5bn in a project in Andhra Pradesh to convert 6 million farmers to 100% chemical-free agriculture by 2021, and have already converted 550,000 farmers. “Even on current numbers it is the world’s largest and most transformative project anywhere,” he said. And the model works because the $1bn the state government saves in fertiliser subsidies will be more than enough to pay off the interest on the loan within five years’ time.

“Everything is possible. In this room each of you can be a champion. Step out of your comfort zone and think big and with all the creativity at your command.”

Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of LanzaTech, which has created a breakthrough substitute for jet fuel from industrial waste gases, pointed out that CO2 emissions rose 3% last year, while the IPCC report says we have to reduce global emissions by 50% by 2030 to keep temperature rises to 1.5C. “We really have to think about our carbon economy, we have to rethink single-use carbon and we should only put carbon where we absolutely have to put it,” she said.

Although LanzaTech’s technology can be converted into aviation fuel, and fuelled a Virgin Atlantic flight from Orlando to London last year, it may not be the most efficient use in a carbon-constrained future. Better to use the technology, which creates ethanol by recycling waste gases from industries such as steel, to replace petroleum as feedstock for a suite of different chemicals, which are used to create plastics, tires and carpet fibre.

After 15 years of research and development, the company last May opened its first production facility, a 16m gallon-per-year ethanol production plant in China. “I invite you to see a future where a steel plant doesn’t only make steel to make a plane, but its gases can be fermented to make a gasoline substitute for the fuel that powers that plane. That’s truly a circular economy, using every last bit of carbon, which is what we have to do.”

But she said it had required 80,000 hours of demonstration and four pilot plants before LanzaTech’s first commercial facility was opened last year. “What it takes is money, time, and a lot of patience,” she said.

It also requires partnerships with governments willing to help “on the pilot scale, on the demo scale and on the first commercial scale … China wanted to do something in the [steel] sector, and was willing to risk new technology introduction.”

The spotlight was then on the role of cities in driving decarbonisation as leaders in Hoboken, New Bedford and Chicago explained what they are doing to help the energy transition.

Moderator Stephanie Kersten-Johnston, New York organiser of the Circular Economy Club, pointed out that carbon-reduction action by US cities alone could potentially account for 6% of the necessary emissions reductions to keep to the 1.5C warming scenario.

Jon Mitchell, mayor of New Bedford, Massachusetts, who is also chair of the United States Conference of Mayors’ energy committee, said the current generation of mayors have a great deal more on their plate than their predecessors, particularly in the US, where the Trump administration has been unwilling to tackle the big issues that face the country. “Mayors these days have to think about climate change, they have to think about international trade, they have to think about pollution.”

He added: “The role of the private sector is indispensable,” he said, “Because cities can’t do it alone.”

Kurt Summers, treasurer of the City of Chicago, emphasised the critical role of cities in addressing climate change both as investors and buyers of goods and services. He pointed out that in the US there are $12trn sitting in city, county and state coffers, both treasury and retirement assets. “This is real capital, equal to the annual GDP of the UK.”

Chicago has used that leverage by putting ESG requirements for the entire $8.5bn portfolio it manages, stipulating a minimum ESG score along with a minimum credit score. It’s also committed to have a carbon-neutral portfolio by 2020.

He said it took two years of hard work to bring about this change, educating the public and city council, and fighting lobbyists for Big Oil and within the trade union. “We were ultimately successful, but it was a tough fight.”

But 2018, the first full year under the new investment policy, was the best year ever for the portfolio, with returns three times as high as when he entered office four years ago. “It has led to a flight to quality in our portfolio, and we believe other institutional investors and municipal investors are beginning to follow suit.”

In procurement, Chicago has used its leverage to advance its social as well as environmental objectives. While implementing the largest project in North America to retrofit street lights with LED, the city started in the poorest neighbourhoods, with the highest crime and violence. “We used that opportunity not only to show investment in those communities, but as a job-creation and skills programme. Thousands of people have found new trades and gained employment because we made an investment in energy efficiency.”

The importance of boosting the role of forests in fighting climate change was highlighted in the afternoon keynote, given jointly by Sophie Beckham, senior manager of natural capital stewardship for International Paper company, and Kerry Cesareo, vice president of forests at WWF US.

Cesareo said WWF’s Living Planet report last year raised the alarm on the 60% decrease in wildlife populations over the past 40 years, and the loss of 18m acres of forest every year.

“This matters because nature is not just nice to have. Our industries, our economies are powered by nature, humans and businesses depend on nature. We need nature to thrive if we are to thrive.”

She said just as the world has responded to the climate threat with the Paris agreement, WWF and others are calling for a new agreement on nature and people.

“To reverse these trends we believe companies and stakeholders need to come together to create a forest-positive future,” focused on doing more good rather than less bad.

Beckham said her company, the biggest user of wood fibre in the world, “relies entirely on the sustainability of forests … Our size and scale means we have a tremendous opportunity for positive impact.”

The company decided a year ago to work with WWF on developing the world’s first science-based target for forests, which will establish what target the company should set for itself in 2030 to ensure it stays within the equivalent of 1.5C for forests, in other words the tipping points that cannot be transgressed if forests are to sustain life on Earth.

Beckham said the targets that would emerge from the work would help inform “comprehensive action that companies, governments and NGOs could take to ensure forests thrive.”

The need to minimise human impact on the planet was also emphasised by TerraCycle CEO Tom Szaky in the closing keynote. The recycling entrepreneur, who has partnered with the world’s biggest brands to introduce durable packaging through the Loop platform, said: “We are in a world today where all assumptions are open for grabs,” because of the threat of climate change and the realisation, for the first time in history, that our children will not have better lives than us because of social and environmental degradation.

“There is only one thing causing it all, and it is over-consumption, and that ties to the act of buying,” he said. “We take the act of voting so seriously, but we vote for the future multiple times a day with what we buy,” Szaky said. “If we stop taking the cheese in the single wrap, they’ll stop making it.”

463,Mapping a circular route,"Globally, for the first time ever, more than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas. The rapid growth of cities presents serious challenges, such as pressure on freshwater supplies, the living environment and public health.

Goal 11 of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals is to “make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”.

The latest issue of Resurgence & Ecologist magazine is out now!

As well as the challenges, cities also present opportunities: housing and population density can bring efficiency gains for technological innovation to reduce resource and energy consumption. Cities can move faster than national governments; hence the new mantra: “While nations talk, cities act.”

The London Waste and Recycling Board (LWARB) had this in mind when we signed up to become part of the CircE Project – an EU Interreg-funded collaboration between eight regions and cities looking at ways to overcome barriers to a circular economy.

We welcomed those European partners to our new office in London to show how the city is accelerating its transition to a circular economy.

The group visited sites such as Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, Mercato Metropolitano (a food market building a sustainable food community in Southwark), and Sustainable Bankside. LWARB also hosted an evening in which pioneering London-based small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) such as the award-winning Chip[s] Board, Toast Ale and Library of Things presented their circular business models.

I believe that it is cities that will power a global circular economy – an approach that provides a sustainable and profitable alternative to the way our ‘linear’ economy currently works. This belief sits at the heart of everything LWARB does.

In June 2017 we published London’s Circular Economy Route Map, one of the first of its kind. Prioritising action in the built environment, food, textiles, plastics and electronic equipment sectors, the Route Map identifies a £7-billion-per-year opportunity for London in these areas alone.

Since then, other cities and countries have followed suit as the advantages of a circular economy become clearer and more pressing.

In London, LWARB is establishing one of the most comprehensive circular economy programmes for a city anywhere in the world.

London is fertile ground: four of the UK’s top ten universities are here, it is a global financial centre, and it has a thriving tech sector, amongst other advantages.

The LWARB programme is built upon three main pillars: helping circular businesses to grow through advice and funding; working with corporates to develop circular economy demonstration projects; and working with local authorities to recycle more waste.

LWRB’s Advance London programme provides investment and business support to SMEs that want to grow their circular businesses or transition to a circular business model. We have invested in several circular economy funds, and our business support team, jointly funded by the EU, has so far helped over 100 SMEs and is still only halfway through a three-year programme.

We are working with some of the most innovative enterprises in the world, which use recycled material as an input, make their products recyclable, more durable or modular, and sell products as services (leasing) or enable the sharing of excess capacity.

The Circular London programme works with corporates to demonstrate the possibilities of the circular economy through pilot projects and create a network of circular economy practitioners to help deliver the Route Map actions.

If we can demonstrate effective and profitable circular business models and the right policy context to help them flourish, we could make a difference not just in London, but globally.

The Resource London programme is London’s waste authority and business waste support programme, a partnership between LWARB and WRAP (Waste and Resources Action Programme). Its objective is primarily to increase London’s recycling rate, helping to deliver the mayor’s aim that London become a zero-waste city and ensuring that by 2030 65 percent of London’s municipal waste is being recycled.

The programme works with London’s waste authorities to improve and harmonise services, but also communicates directly with Londoners through a range of behaviour-change campaigns, in order to minimise waste and make recycling the norm.

A circular economy keeps products and materials circulating within the economy at their highest value for as long as possible, an approach that is more resource-efficient and protects businesses from fluctuating commodity prices. It could provide a more stable operating environment for manufacturers, retailers and con­sumers – potentially of benefit to London post Brexit as it also creates the possibility of new revenue streams, markets and product lines.

This is LWARB’s vision for London – a circular city that capitalises on these opportunities to become a more resili­ent, resource-efficient and competitive city of the future.

Through our work with stakeholders of every variety, we aim to be the lead facilitator and practitioner of circular economy in London, already home to so many exciting circular businesses across a range of sectors.

Through collaboration with businesses, consumers, policymakers and others, we know that our progressive and outward-looking city can sustain and grow one of the most open and dynamic (circular) economies in the world.

467,Circular design to be showcased at Norwegian Presence in Milan,"Furniture, lamps and jewellery by designers from Norway, which demonstrate sustainable design and the circular economy, will be displayed at an exhibition called Join at this year's Milan design week.

Join is this year's offering from Norwegian Presence at Milan design week, which runs from 9 to 14 April. It will showcase the work of 21 designers, alongside seven of the country's leading manufacturers, in three connected rooms in what was previously a garage.

Curated by Jannicke Kråkvik and Alessandro D'Orazio who together make up design studio Kråkvik&D'Orazio, the work on show aims to highlight the economic and social dimensions of circular design.

""Why should we design a new thing? In addition to aesthetics, the object must have a value in terms of materiality or durability,"" said Kråkvik.

""The items we have chosen must give something in return – through longevity, decomposability or the way in which they are produced.""

Items on show will include tables, glass vases, chairs, and storage units as well as jewellery made from reindeer bone and jagged clay pieces embedded with twigs, bark, sand and plants.

""The exhibited objects highlight how the boundaries between craft and design aren't as clear as before. Designers no longer design solely for mass production,"" continued Kråkvik.

Once the pieces were selected, each maker worked with the curatorial team to find further ways to maximise its sustainable qualities.

Oslo-based designers Kristine Bjaadal and Hallgeir Homstvedt conceived the exhibition design. It is constructed entirely from recyclable and reusable materials, allowing it to be dismantled and repurposed once the design week ends.

""We noticed that a lot of the products chosen for the exhibition were conceived around a circular shape. With the title Join and the exhibition's focus on collaboration and sustainability, the circle seemed the natural symbol to use,"" said Bjaadal.

""The shape will appear in many different ways – as details in mobile walls and modules, for example, and in Volver's circular rugs.""

Other exhibitors include Tron Meyer, who will show Varde, a sculpture of stacked hemispherical forms. The flat surface of each split stone exposes a core of 290 million-year old volcanic rock.

Meyer will also show Half Moon Table and Cyclop, a furniture series in anodised aluminium, larvikite and Norwegian Dinesin Douglas wood.

Kim Thomé's Tango recyclable tables can easily be disassembled and repaired, while Bergen studio KnudsenBergHindenes's Hive storage unit is not only recyclable but also made from recycled materials.

Scraps and offcuts from granite slabs find their way into Kent Fonn Skare's Universell furniture.

Arkitektur, Etterklang and Struktur av Minner is a series of glazed objects in porcelain and stoneware. They ""are objects studying cyclic processes of change, such as growth, transformation and decay,"" said their maker, Anita Hanch-Hansen.

Her work combines clay with natural materials such as twigs and sand, which emit colour and leave sculptural traces on the finished objects.

Other designers featured are Erik Wester, Henrik Ødegaard, Kaja Solgaard Dahl, Kim Thomé, Marte Frøystad, Martin Høgh Olsen, Mijo Studio, Noidoi, Stine Aas, Vera & Kyte, and Máret Ánne Sara & Matt Lambert.

The exhibition is organised by DOGA (Design and Architecture Norway), Klubben, an initiative founded by three Norwegian designers in 2011, and Norwegian Crafts, who together have presented the exhibition during Milan design week for the last five years.

Last year's edition of the exhibition focused on the idea of collaboration and how this quality which the Norwegians call ""fellesskap"" was integral to building a modern Norway.

Join by Norwegian Presence will be at via Savona 35, Milan from 9 to 14 April 2019.",United Kingdom,2019.03
468,Chemistry as the key to a circular society,"Chemistry as the key to a circular society

Sustainability, renewable energy, recycling… These are all hot topics in our current society. With green solutions, clean energy and recycling programs we aim to tackle today’s challenges. However, we often do not realize the key role of chemistry in all this. This week, a delegation of the Dutch Topsector Chemistry is visiting China. With visits to the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology to sessions with scientific and business partners, they aim to foster more cooperation and discover how we can start the necessary transition towards a circular economy.

Bert Weckhuysen is Professor of Inorganic Chemistry and Catalysis at Utrecht University, member of the Topsector Chemistry and scientific director of ARC CBBC, the Dutch research institute for new chemical building blocks. He explains that chemistry can play a key role in battling climate change and achieving more circularity. “To chemists, carbon is just a chemical element. A precious ‘form’ of carbon that we know are diamonds. We all know the statement ‘diamonds are forever’, but that’s actually not true. We can transform diamonds into carbon black or carbon dioxide, which shows that we can change the form of chemical elements. Basically, our society is largely built from carbon and even we ourselves are partly made from carbon. The principle of circularity is that everything that’s made from, for example carbon, can also be turned into any form of carbon and back: if a diamond can be converted into carbon dioxide, then surely a chemist can do the reverse and turn carbon dioxide into a ‘diamond’.”

This of course also holds for the burning of fuels. Fuels produce carbon dioxide during burning and chemists now want to develop the technology to do the reverse: convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into fuels. Weckhuysen illustrates that chemistry can enhance air quality and tackle environmental problems with the example of acid rain: “This used to be a serious problem some decades ago. The emission of cars included oxides of sulphur and nitrogen, resulting in acid rain which was harmful to forests in many countries. However, we were able to find catalysts that can remove sulphur and nitrogen from our emissions and our transportation fuels. Now, the obvious next step is to see how we can tackle today’s problems and remove carbon dioxide from the air. We aim to transform it into interesting products. In other words: we’re trying to turn the harmful waste of industry and transportation into products that our society needs, such as fuels. Hopefully, in the long run this will decrease our dependency non-renewable fuels and even enhance the air quality in our cities by reducing smog.”

Besides this focus on carbon circularity and carbon dioxide curtailing, the mission also addresses the development of more sustainable and futureproof coatings. “You can think of your wall paint. We’re already adding properties to this, for instance a color. But wouldn’t it be interesting if we can make coatings with added functionalities? Besides this, we also need to start thinking about making our coatings more sustainable. Currently, many coatings are made out of crude oil. Using alternative materials, such as municipal waste or certified biomass, allows us to make more sustainable coatings,” explains Weckhuysen.

Maurice Mourad, Program Manager at ARC CBBC, is interested in the cooperation with Chinese counterparts. “There’s a lot of talent at Chinese universities. Through scientific cooperation between the two countries that are strong in chemical innovation, we can further the research and explore more practical applications.” He also adds the third aim of their visit to China. “We’re currently exploring the topic of chemical recycling of plastics. This is an important area of research to making our society more sustainable. Humankind is producing a lot of plastics; China is even producing one fourth of all the plastics worldwide. We are sure that this topic will also resonate in China and hope to set up a related Sino-Dutch research program. We are actively looking for both academic and industrial partners to develop this topic further.”",Netherlands,2019.03

484,Cheese into vodka! The benefits of a circular economy,"The circular economy concept aims to minimise waste and optimise resources.

With a heightened focus on sustainability across sectors (and the world) in the last few years, manufacturers are steadily looking to implement more sustainable operations.

Somerset-based and sixth-generation cheesemaker, Barber’s, produce over 80 tonnes of cheese every day. The business source the milk used to make it from local dairy farms in the South West region.

When the milk arrives onsite, it is tested and once approved it is split into curds and whey. The whey is removed and the curds continue to be processed to create their award-winning hard cheeses.

“Cheesemaking is the core of the business, all of the milk goes into that process, but about 85% of the milk is removed in the form of whey,” director at Barber’s, Giles Barber tells me at the Somerset site.

The team at Barber’s uses the entire milk fraction, the curds, whey and water. He explains, “We separate any residual butterfat from the whey and that goes into making farmhouse butter.

“We then take the liquid and process the whey protein through a sophisticated membrane and concentrate it to the right level to be used in infant formula products. All of it is exported outside of the UK to infant formula factories in places like the Philippines, Thailand and Australia.”

The circular economy concept means that when a product reaches the end of its life, its materials are kept within the economy wherever possible.

Barber adds, “The last part of the process is to separate the lactose. We separate this into a concentrated serum that then goes to either be fermented and distilled to make vodka – we have a cousin [Jason Barber] who has a brand called Black Cow Vodka – or it goes into anaerobic digestion plants for energy creation.”

Barber says, “The final by-product is water, which we use to wash down and clean the cheesemaking areas. Once that has been done, the water is then piped a few miles underground to a purification plant where it is cleaned to a standard that allows us to put it back into the water system. It is often cleaner than the river it goes into, so it is improving the river water quality.”

First Ireland Spirits manufacture around 1.2 million (9L) cases of Irish cream every year in the rural Irish midlands.

A few years ago, the site set about integrating a new measuring system to improve efficiency.

Plant manufacturing lead, Joe Claffey said to The Manufacturer on a visit earlier this year, “We added load cells onto tanks to measure weights, automated valves to control the flow of liquid and a number of mass flow meters.

“The SCADA system is measuring everything, recording and logging all the batches, making the process quicker and totally consistent. The new system, coupled with the expertise of our liquid processing team, has enabled us to operate much more efficiently and has allowed us to increase plant output significantly.”

The greater control of the plant via the SCADA system has also enabled First Ireland Spirits to focus on making their plant more energy efficient.

As a member of Origin Green (the Irish government’s food and drink sustainability program), the site has been working towards becoming more environmentally friendly.

“In 2015, alongside the new SCADA system we installed an energy buffer system. This has allowed us to reduce our electricity consumption by 22% and our diesel consumption by 16%, something we are proud of as a site, we are continually looking to improve our sustainability,” says Claffey.

Not only does a sustainable model save and make money; in Barber’s case using the by-product water to clean the cheesemaking areas, and selling the lactose to energy creation plants, it helps drive sustainable production, thus conserving natural resources, and, it just makes sense.

First Ireland Spirits also proves that by integrating environmentally-friendly concepts with business strategy in mind, production can increase, energy costs are reduced and so profits are driven up.

The main challenge is the implementation and understanding of where sustainable methods can be introduced. This could take time that some businesses don’t believe they have short-term. However, long-term it is a necessity, and manufacturers are engaging and acting on their 21st century circular economy strategies.",United Kingdom,2019.03
489,Chemical recycling of plastic: Waste no more?,"Plastics recycling is as much of a challenge as an opportunity for the circular economy. Michael Laermann looks at chemical recycling and whether it can make the plastics value chain more circular whilst providing a profitable new industry branch.

Michael Laermann is a sustainability consultant, freelance editor and founder of Reason & Rhyme, a strategic consulting and communications firm.

Around 25.8 million tonnes of plastic waste are generated in the EU every year. Less than 30% of it is getting collected for recycling. This is a significant loss of valuable resources to the economy, and with a huge cost to the environment.

In Europe, amidst growing public concern, new regulation and voluntary pledges from the industry, the problem is that so little of the plastic that is collected actually gets turned into new material. In 2016, from the 72.7% collected waste only 31.1% actually got converted.

This is mainly because mechanical recycling – shredding into resin pellets – only works for pure plastic types like PET bottles. Composite, dirty materials usually get incinerated. As a consequence, more than half of Europe’s plastic converters are running short on suitable waste. Producers that want to use recycled material for their products cannot rely on steady supply streams of quality feedstock.

To tackle this situation, both lawmakers and the industry are taking a fresh look into chemical recycling. The technology itself is not new. It has been used to turn plastic into fuel for decades. What is new is the growing market demand for high-quality plastic recyclate, due to significantly higher targets for recycled plastic in packaging products and a heightened sense of corporate responsibility.

For lawmakers the concern is to avoid “waste-to-fuel lock-ins”. The revised EU waste legislation states that plastic waste can be considered as recycled only if it is not subject to energy recovery and is reprocessed into new materials that are not to be used as fuels. This definition is technology neutral, but is complex when it comes to transforming plastics back into basic chemicals. The ultimate goal is nothing less than closing a gap in the waste management process to seize the benefits of a circular plastic economy.

There are four methods of chemical recycling, which are substantially different in terms of waste input and obtained products:
• Depolymerisation turns mono plastic (like PET bottles) back into monomers, which can be re-polymerised into new PET-based products.
• Solvolysis (dissolution) is used to break down certain plastics like expanded polystyrene (EPS) into monomers with the aid of solvents.
• Pyrolysis converts mixed plastics into tar oil which can be cracked down and further refined for new plastics production.
• Gasification is able to process unsorted, uncleaned plastic waste and turn it into syngas, which can be used to build bigger building blocks for new polymers.

The last two of these – pyrolysis and gasification – transform plastics, and most of their additives and contaminants into basic chemicals. In theory, any kind of plastic waste can be converted. To meet the same quality standards as primary feedstock, some pre-sorting of non-organic waste or purification of the output material may be necessary. If the resulting oil and gas are used for chemical production, the final plastic products will be identical to those produced from conventional feedstock.

To this end, Air Liquide, Nouryon, Enerkem, Shell and the Port of Rotterdam are currently preparing a commercial-scale gasification facility to be operational in 2020. The objective is to produce syngas and methanol from organic waste that Nouryon would turn into chemical products. In addition to mixed plastic waste, the pilot plant will also be able to process biomass, diapers, rotten paper, and the likes.

Chemical recycling through gasification still has a number of hurdles to jump before crossing the finish line. Firstly, gasification plants are built at larger scale than pyrolysis, which means that the initial hurdle for investment is particularly high. Next is the dependency on waste streams that imply logistical costs, followed by fluctuating flowrates and varying compositions the syngas has on the gas grid of a chemical production complex.

Pyrolysis has its challenges, too. But due to their smaller scale, it has been easier for companies to keep some pilot facilities running. Even though pyrolysis is capable of handling any type of organic material, non-organic materials like metals, glass fibers, halogens and often PET need to be removed from the input stream, ideally before the process or through purification of the pyrolysis oil afterwards. Remaining non-organic pollutants represent a cost factor. This means that using ocean litter as an input material is not a viable option, also for additional factors like daunting logistics and massive water consumption for rinsing.

But soon, even food-grade plastic could be commercially produced from pyrolysed plastic waste. At the end of 2018, BASF with several partners announced the development of refrigerator components, insulation panels and even mozzarella packaging that consist of polymers generated from such pyrolysed plastic waste. In this ChemCycling collaboration project, waste operators deliver mixed plastic to technology providers for the pyrolysis procedure. BASF then uses the generated naphtha to produce high-quality plastic material that downstream customers use in their final products.

BASF project lead Stefan Gräter states that chemical recycling provides a valuable cleaning function in a circular economy resulting in secondary materials with “virgin” properties. Even under the optimistic assumption that packaging products could be re-designed to a large extent, contaminants and additives could be accumulated in the material over several mechanical recycling cycles and might lead to poor product performance or even health risks. “From this perspective, chemical recycling is a complementary option to established recycling and waste management processes”, Gräter argues.

To bring it to an industrial scale, chemical recycling needs to strike a balance between economic viability, regulatory compliance, and environmental impact. When it comes to the latter, gasification of mixed plastic waste and pyrolysis of sorted plastics yield superior CO2 reduction scores than incineration with energy recovery, according to a recent study by the independent research and consultancy firm CE Delft.

From a business point of view, McKinsey sees “opportunities to build a new and profitable branch of the industry based on recycled plastics” that might represent a profit pool of nearly 50 billion Euros per year worldwide by 2030. Under a scenario where much larger quantities of plastic waste are routed for reuse instead of going to landfill and incineration, they see a “potential for chemical companies to transform two areas: polymers produced from mechanical recycling, and the whole field of pyrolysis and chemical recycling of used plastics Projecting a step further, it’s possible to imagine a wholly new configuration of petrochemical and plastics plants.”

The true potential for chemical recycling to become profitable depends on the sufficient supply of suitable plastic feedstock, and the further development of pyrolysis and gasification technologies to produce high volumes of recyclates with consistent quality at a competitive price.

But reaching that potential also depends on conducive regulatory framework. At a policy briefing between stakeholders and European policy makers in Brussels, EU Environment Commissioner Karmenu Vella emphasised the Commission’s intention to investigate further incentives and regulatory measures to increase the recyclability of plastics and make it a valuable resource. According to Vella, improved sorting and recycling techniques can also contribute to this objective: “The Commission is eager to learn more about chemical recycling.”

So we can expect this debate to be a big one for Commissioner Vella’s successor, and for the next Commission as a whole.",Belgium,2019.03

520,The 2019 Circular Economy debate in Europe – more mature than ever,"Circular economy is not another hype. From all it seems that it is an aim that will stay with us for a while and that will be inherited to the next EU term.

The debates at the High-Level Circular Economy Stakeholder Conference have witnessed an evolution – from blaming and shaming to a talk that has higher chances than ever to be walked. There are a couple of greatest advancements – bigger willingness to work collaboratively, attentiveness to arguments, more listening and a clear recognition that there is not a single finely-tunned business model that will close the loop. “It is the business opportunities and new business models that will make up a successful story of the Circular Economy”, noted the chairwoman of European Parliament’s environmental committee, Adina Ioana Valean.

APPLiA’s Director-General, Paolo Falcioni focused on the fact that not only Europe, but all continents are lagging behind in the set up of a circular economy because what countries need to build first, together with the society, is a Circular Culture. A one-minute video, part of the Association’s Manifesto campaign, served him better than a hundred arguments and with it he gave an answer to questions about engaging Europeans in circularity, about non-tracked waste and the need of consumer awareness. In the same spirit during the opening session, Ellen MacArthur’s Director, Jocelyn Blériot said: “it is not that we have a blank page to choose between linear or Circular economy. We have ecodesign and EPR, but for that new system, we need to co-create some of these instruments. We need a civil society.”

The hook for a number of speakers was how to ensure that consumers make the right choice when the moment to take a decision comes. To repair, to reuse or to replace, undoubtedly, the consumer must have a choice. Speaking about repair, which expectedly, was one of the topics that was coming back in almost every session, Paolo Falcioni underlined that today, 81% of the home appliances are actually repaired. “I would like to praise the European Commission, and this does not happen often, for having decided to put safety first with the finalisation of the ecodesign requirements for resource efficiency. Repair can’t be everybody’s job”, he concluded.",European Union,2019.03

528,Prince Charles says Commonwealth is 'vital' to future of humanity,"The Prince of Wales today said the Commonwealth is “vital” to the health of the world and the future of humanity.

In an impassioned speech Prince Charles - the future head of the Commonwealth - said it had been the “cornerstone” of his life.

And he said he believes it plays a crucial role bringing “us together” to “address common challenges” like the serious threat of climate change.

Charles, confirmed as the next head of the 70-year-old association of 53 countries by its leaders after the Queen, spoke out at the start of a major Commonwealth tour of the Caribbean and also an historic visit to Communist Cuba, the first there by a British royal.

The Prince, on this tour representing the Queen at the behest of the Foreign Office, has long been a passionate advocate of sustainability and the circular economy.

He said the Commonwealth has real power - as it represents a third of the world’s population - to tackle global challenges that impact on us all.

“The Commonwealth has been the cornerstone of my life for as long as I can remember and through all the unprecedented challenges of those past seven decades it seems to me that the Commonwealth remains as vital today as it has ever been.”

Speaking at the official welcoming parade in St. Lucia today, at the Philip Marcellin Grounds, ahead of a reception Serenity Hotel, Coconut Bay to mark the island country’s 40th anniversary independence, he said: “Importantly the Commonwealth brings us together and gives us the means to harness shared opportunities as well as to address common challenges.”

The Prince was also at pains to praised the resilience of the people of the Caribbean region who suffered personal hardship after the devastating hurricanes Mafia and Irma in 2017. Charles visited the region at the time to see first hand their impact.

The Prince went on to praise St Lucia - the only country to be named after a woman with more Nobel Laureates per capita than any other country - saying: “St. Lucia has a big history and the road that St Lucia travelled to independence in 1979 was long and took many turns.

“Four decades on as you look back at the journey you have taken and look ahead to the future you are building, the people of St Lucia have so much of which they can be proud.”

Prince Charles later left St Lucia to fly to Barbados - the hub for visiting the other islands using an RAF Voyager available for the Queen, Charles and Prime Minister, where he will be reunited with his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, who flew to the region ahead of the tour.

The visit to Cuba on 24 March for three days is being hailed as important in building diplomatic ties between the two counties as it is the first time such a senior royal figure has visited.

Given that the Queen no longer undertakes long haul travel Charles’s visit is seen as having the same high status as a State visit.",United Kingdom,2019.03
531,Experts detect big differences in party stances on climate change,"The news agency STT approached several environmental organisations and specialists about how Finland's main political parties differ in the pre-election solutions they are offering to tackle climate change.

The experts agree that none of the parliamentary parties seem to understand how quickly new policies must be enacted in order to avoid dire consequences.

The panel advises voters that are concerned about climate change to first compare the parties' goals for achieving carbon neutrality in Finland. Attaining a net zero carbon footprint would require lowering overall carbon dioxide emission levels to equal carbon removal capacity. Finland's vast forests already provide a sizeable carbon sink, but other measures such as carbon offsetting and increased renewable energy are also important in this effort.

STT's experts say the parties' projected carbon neutral dates are a good indicator of their willingness to forsake fossil fuels and peat, for example.

The Greens pledge that they want Finland to be carbon neutral by 2030, while the Social Democrats (SDP) and the Swedish People's Party (SPP) have set a target of 2035.

The centre-right National Coalition Party (NCP) says it wants to make fossil fuels a thing of the past ""sometime in the 2030s"", while the Centre Party has set a target date of 2045.

The Left Alliance is also ambitious, saying that they want to ""make Finland carbon-negative by the early 2030s"".

Carbon neutrality target dates are conspicuously missing in the election platforms of the Christian Democrats, the Blue Reform and the Finns Party.

Environmental rights researcher Heta Heiskanen of the University of Tampere says a second important target for eco-conscious citizens to analyse is the emission reduction percentage that political parties state in their manifestos.

For example, the Greens call for 60 percent reductions, while the NCP calls for an increase in the 2030 EU emissions reduction target to 55 percent from its current 40 percent, compared with 1990 levels. Many of the remaining parties, like the SDP, Centre and the Left Alliance, pledge that they would like to see emission reduction percentages increased, but without stating specific numbers.

Another thing the experts say voters can follow is whether the parties have clear plans in place to make attainment of these targets possible.

""Ask yourself whether they are speaking of larger entities and significant political policies, or if they seem bogged down in discussions of the little details,"" says project manager Janne Peljo of the Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra.

Lack of understanding about the means towards the end

Before Christmas, eight of the nine parliamentary parties in Finland sat down to compose a joint statement that said the country must play its part in limiting the global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. However, according to the experts that spoke with STT, the parties do not necessarily understand the means required to make good on this commitment.

Mia Rahunen, a climate expert at WWF Finland, points out that this promise can't be kept without eliminating the use of fossil fuels. She too feels that none of the party manifestos seem to reveal a sufficient understanding of the seriousness of the situation.

The parties show clear differences when it comes to laying out specific courses of action, the STT experts say. For example, the Greens, Left Alliance, SPP and SDP each have clear action points to tackle climate change in their election manifestos, while the NCP and Centre Party sections on the environment raise many questions.

""When it comes to the former government coalition parties in particular, it is tough [to understand their climate goals]. They seem to say one thing and do another,"" says Olli Tiainen, climate and energy campaigner and project leader at Greenpeace Nordic.

Tampere University's Heiskanen agrees that it is difficult to ascertain the NCP stance from their pre-election platform.

""It's hard to figure out how much of the work will be left to volunteer organizations, and how much they will be effectively pushing things forward themselves,"" she says.

Climate expert Hanna Aho from the development NGO umbrella group Fingo says that she too has sensed a conflict within the NCP. She says that the party has presented several concrete initiatives to combat climate change, and several MPs have made important contributions, but that she found many of their campaign slogans to be in some part antagonistic to the cause.

Aho also says it is also valuable to examine party messages for their consistency. For example, a political party might have outlined ambitious climate goals, but at the same time be in support of subsidies that are harmful to the environment.

Next government will have a major climate impact

After the 14 April elections, the future government will define climate policy for the next four years. The experts in the STT poll predict several divisive issues may come up in negotiations to form the new coalition. For example, there are clear dividing lines between the parties on the issue of using peat for energy, the area of business subsidies, and the extent to which a climate action plan should be built on the back of Finland's electricity supply.

Heiskanen estimates that potential coalition partners will have an easier time agreeing on such things as support for the circular economy and funding for research and development.

WWF's Rahunen says it is unclear how big a priority climate issues will be in the government formation talks, as none of the nine parliamentary parties have indicated whether certain climate measures would be potential red lines in the sand when it comes to cooperation.

Fingo's Aho comments that the ideal situation would be a future government made up of parties with mutually reinforcing environmental aims.

""But if, for example, the SDP and the NCP end up in the same coalition, with no Green or Left Alliance input, then it's really hard for me to see that at the end of the day, sufficient climate action would be taken,"" she says.

Heiskanen says she was also surprised by how little mention the parties made of legislation in the climate sections of their pre-election manifestos.

""Only the Swedish People's Party had nicely declared that climate considerations should be taken into account in the drafting of all future laws.""",Finland,2019.03
533,Laurea Circular Economy Jam - Are you ready to Jam with us?,"Laurea staff, students and international and Finnish partners will join teams in designing innovative circular solutions for seven different challenges.

539,EDJX gets funding to power serverless near-edge apps secured by blockchain,"EDJX, a distributed edge computing platform and decentralized peer to peer marketplace, has announced launch with $2M in funding from strategic investors, along with key partnerships with ITRenew, Advisian, and Chainyard.

The company aims to power real-time applications at the edge by building the world’s largest edge computing platform using its blockchain-based management of serverless and container-based applications. The funding round included 6Fusion USA, Inc., and 4 unnamed private investors.

“The rush to build capacity at the near-edge – in the last 1000 feet to connected things – will completely dominate the next decade of IT. The near-edge is going to be orders of magnitude larger than what we think of as the edge today.”

The company intends to deploy tens of thousands of microdata centers called EdjPods to major metropolitan and industrial locations worldwide. The goal is to bring cloud computing closer to mobile and IoT devices to accelerate and secure edge applications.

“Our platform ushers in a new era of applications that will rely on a myriad of sensors and other connected devices to carry out their tasks. These applications will need to process zettabytes of data with low latency to work effectively in real-world environments.”

EDJX’s platform directs the execution of serverless requests to EdjPods in close physical proximity to mobile and edge devices. Serverless requests are transparently routed to the nearest EdjPod where they are executed inside of an isolated environment. As security is a big concern for edge use cases, each serverless request is validated by and recorded to a blockchain to create an immutable record of execution.
• Overcome latency and bandwidth limitations at the edge by deploying serverless functions in close proximity to IoT and mobile devices
• Enable IoT and mobile devices to securely access and record data at the edge using blockchain
• Pay as you go for edge computing and blockchain usage

Developed over the past 18 months, EDJX’s serverless edge application platform is now available in early-access.

For IT operators and facility owners, EDJX also creates new opportunities to earn passive revenue while increasing the desirability of their properties. EdjPods are available at no cost to qualified commercial, industrial, and municipal organizations.

By hosting EdjPods operators and owners can:
• Increase the appeal of properties to prospective tenants who are using edge computing to create smart buildings, cities, refineries, and factories.
• Create new passive revenue streams connected to the utilization of the EDJX network and EdjPods hosted on premises.

ITRenew and EDJX Partner to Deliver EdjPods Using Circular Economy Practices

ITRenew announced its partnership with EDJX to deliver EdjPod, powered by Sesame. EdjPod is a fully-integrated multi-node server platform for microdata centers and points of presence based on OpenCompute standards.

“Sesame brings the leading technology of hyperscale cloud – low power, automation, scalability – to a broad set of markets and modern global use cases, including edge computing. As the leading provider of circular data center solutions, ITRenew recognized that the missing link in catalyzing the growth of open hardware beyond the hyperscale, is product innovation that enables supply, quality, and supportability for unique customers and globally distributed deployments. EdjX is pioneering modern edge infrastructure at scale – software and hardware – with blockchain and Sesame.”

Together, ITRenew and EDJX bring circular economy practices to the edge. Sesame is a recertified, warrantied, high-performance open compute and storage product line that maximizes lifetime value and sustainability of IT hardware. EdjPod, Powered by Sesame, is fully self-contained and includes 4 compute nodes along with wireless and network equipment. EdjPods are available in both indoor and outdoor configurations suitable for a wide variety of commercial and industrial settings.

The companies expect to ship up to 10,000 EdjPods in 2019 through 2021 based on current and future designs.

Advisian Digital, a division of WorleyParsons, announced a joint effort with EDJX to explore solutions to meet the needs of a growing Industrial IoT market in the Energy and Resources industry sector.

“Like many other industries, the Energy and Resources market is undergoing a major transformation fueled by the demand for instant data analysis and workflow automation at the edge. We believe EDJX could accelerate the pace of development and release of groundbreaking solutions that solve real-world challenges.”

The EDJX joint effort expands upon the companies partnership, which also includes Requis.com, a multi-vertical industrial asset supply chain online platform.

Chainyard, a pioneer in the blockchain software industry, announced a partnership with EDJX to co-develop commercial software projects. EDJX expands the horizon of blockchain because it gives developers a much wider scope to build distributed software applications. A global decentralized network of compute capable of executing smart contracts, combined with the ability to leverage the scale and simplicity of Serverless frameworks, is a game changer for Enterprise customers.”

Chainyard will unveil a suite of development and support services for enterprise customers to take full advantage of the EDJX platform later this year.

The EDJX platform is available for early access to a limited number of developers and prospective customers. There are no fees for using the platform or edge computing capacity during the early access. Access to the platform will be granted incrementally as the EDJX network comes online. Interested developers and prospective customers should register for early-access at the EDJX web site.",Netherlands,2019.03
540,ECHA publishes comprehensive plastic additive inventory,"The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) has published a comprehensive inventory of all of the high-volume plastic additives used to date in the EU. The inventory is expected to provide a better basis for ensuring safe use of these substances.

Additives in plastics are used to achieve desired properties needed to make products fit for purpose and ensure safe use by consumers throughout a product’s service life. The additives recorded in the inventory are antioxidants, antistatics, flame retardants, nucleating agents, plasticisers, pigments, heat stabilisers, and UV/light stabilisers.

Following a two-year project which ended in December 2018 ECHA and 21 industry sector organisations – including manufacturers and downstream users – have generated an inventory characterising more than 400 high-volume plastic additives. High-volume substances were considered those imported at 100 t/y or more.

Using information provided by industry, ECHA and a team of researchers were able to develop a methodology to compare the release potential of additives in a relative and quantitative manner. By comparing the release potentials of additive with the same technical function it might be possible to substitute hazardous substances with safer alternatives.

The project is expected to help industry identify the use and exposure information that is relevant for determining safe use of substances in products, which could trigger the updating of REACH registration dossiers. REACH is an EU regulation concerning the registration, evaluation, and authorisation and restriction of chemicals. The information should be included in registrations and communicated down supply chains so that downstream industries have the correct information about the uses of each substance and its properties.

ECHA and EU member states will use hazard potential information along with use and release information to prioritise substances for in-depth assessment under REACH.

The inventory represents an important step towards improving risk assessment of these substances under REACH and CLP. Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP) complements REACH. The regulation aligns previous EU regulations regarding substances and mixtures with the Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). The GHS is used to communicate the hazards of chemicals with symbols.

Once the required information is available, an analysis will be conducted to assess the impact the project has had on the prioritisation of substances by authorities and on the content and quality of registration dossiers.

The plastic additives inventory will support ECHA’s work on contributing to the 2020 goals of World Summit on Sustainable Development and to the EU’s Strategy for Plastics in the Circular Economy.",United Kingdom,2019.03
541,Invention that could bring clean water to 2.5 billion,"An early stage tech business that turns waste water into fresh water is the winner of the Converge KickStart Programme 2019.

547,"CLIC Midterm Conference - Rijeka, 27/28 March ~","The international conference entitled “Heritage Adaptive Reuse and Circular Economy” will be held in Rijeka on 27-28 March 2019 within the framework of the CLIC project, Circular Models Leveraging Investments in Cultural Heritage Adaptive Reuse, financed by the EU programme HORIZON2020.

The conference aims at sharing experiences and knowledge on the three main topics of the CLIC project, namely:
• – what does adaptive reuse means, which are the conditions to carry out appropriate adaptive reuse, how the concept of adaptive reuse is integrated into the conservation theory and how we do distinguish adaptive reuse from restoration and conservation.
• – what circular economy is and how it relates to the building sector with a specific attention to cultural heritage maintenance and preservation, which are the main links and field of application of the circular economy in the building sector and if there are already successful stories in applying circular economy to cultural heritage;
• – what are we referring to when we talk about historic urban landscape, how the concept developed in the international debate and how do we assess it for its preservation, given that preservation is the real challenge for HUL. In addition, how is the concept of historic urban landscape relating to circular economy and cultural heritage preservation and adaptive reuse.

The conference will tackle the above topics through an ad-hoc perspective, given by the case study of Rijeka, European Cultural Capital in 2020, that has already undertaken numerous redevelopment projects at different scales and which is part of the CLIC consortium, as well as through an international practices exchange, by presenting different ongoing initiatives in Europe and abroad.

Within the Midterm Conference, Rijeka will host other two events. Indeed, the third HUL Workshop will take place on 28th March. Coordinated by the CLIC partner TU/e (Eindhoven University of Technology), the Historic Urban Landscape workshop will challenge the local stakeholders in Rijeka together with the partners to define, through the HUL approach, the main cultural project implementation bottlenecks and barriers in the city and brainstorm solutions to overcome them. The stakeholders are local authorities, practitioners, NGOs, policymakers, researchers, and SMEs who are actively involved in the domain of cultural heritage, circular economy, and urban planning.

The third day will be dedicated to the Peer-Review meeting, hosted at RiHub on 29th March. This will be a great occasion for knowledge exchange among cities, confronted to the problems and solutions in the heritage projects in Rijeka. This activity will be restricted to the CLIC cities and partners as well as stakeholders in Rijeka dealing with adaptive reuse and circular economy.",Italy,2019.03

The Global Commitment and its vision for a circular economy for plastic is led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, in collaboration with UN Environment.

For Stora Enso, signing the commitment is another step to combat the global problem of plastic pollution by providing renewable alternatives. Stora Enso will contribute by cooperating with customers and suppliers to develop circular and low carbon products to replace plastic packaging. The materials are based on wood fibers from sustainably managed forests and plantations. This commitment is an example of the increasing demand for alternatives to plastic, also demonstrated by the EU’s recent policy on single-use plastics.

‘Stora Enso operates at the heart of the circular bioeconomy and we collaborate with customers and partners to create a sustainable future with less plastics,’ said Karl-Henrik Sundström, CEO of Stora Enso. ‘We have, for example, developed a renewable, biodegradable drinking straw to replace the traditional plastic straw, and our moldable biocomposites help reduce the amount of plastic in products.’

The Global Commitment and its vision for a circular economy for plastics are supported by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). It has also been endorsed by the World Economic Forum, The Consumer Goods Forum (a CEO-led organization representing some 400 retailers and manufacturers from 70 countries), and 40 universities, institutions, and academics.

Moreover, more than fifteen financial institutions with in excess of $4 trillion USD in assets under management have endorsed the Global Commitment and over $200 million USD has been pledged by five venture capital funds to create a circular economy for plastic.

The Global Commitment aims to create ‘a new normal’ for plastic packaging. Commitments and targets will be reviewed every 18 months, and become increasingly ambitious over the coming years.

568,Circular economy is good for the econ...,"Circular economy may be the key to growth in numerous sectors. Several manufacturers have realised the potential held by recycled plastic. In addition, new legislation obliges governments, municipalities and the waste sector to increase the recycling and reuse of plastic and other types of waste. The processing of waste for reuse requires expertise and special equipment, which is reflected in the growing demand for waste processing machines.



The waste sector is developing rapidly and showing strong signs of growth. China’s Green Fence and the EU’s plastic strategy have had an impact on waste management in several countries. At the same time, new and sustainable waste processing solutions are in high demand. Increased interest in the circular economy and the recycling of plastic open up new avenues for operators in the waste sector.



Circular economy – the key to global economic growth

Even though waste is now seen as a reusable material rather than as disposable rubbish, it must undergo a significant amount of processing before a manufacturer can use it to produce new products. An increasing number of companies willing to utilise recycled material is not sufficient to guarantee the growth of the circular economy. There is also a dire need for waste sector operators that process waste into usable raw material. 



This processing requires expertise and special equipment. Tana’s waste management solutions come from Finland, a country known for its cutting-edge technology. With its machinery, Tana aims to provide global solutions for improving recycling and reuse of materials.

China’s waste import ban has had an influence on waste management on a global scale, which has been felt acutely in Britain in particular. On the other hand, developing countries, such as Myanmar, which just selected Tana as the provider of its first purpose-built landfill compactor, have begun to pay more attention to the environmental impact of waste.



Now, as the waste management sector faces great challenges, many seek after new solutions. This gives small expert companies the opportunity to shake their underdog status and to provide the needed innovations and fresh approaches.



Increasing revenue and solid growth in the field of waste management

The boom in recycling and the reuse of materials, especially plastic, is expected to increase the demand for waste management operators and thus boost the growth of companies providing waste management machinery. Due to the company’s network structure, Tana is able to act in a more agile manner than many of its competitors which has translated in to strong growth over the past years. In addition to international operations, Tana now invests in the Finnish market that also serves as a platform for developing and testing new solutions.



‘Large corporations face challenges in maintaining customer centricity while operating in multiple market areas. Tana is more agile. In Finland, we communicate directly with our customers. That gives us valuable insight into their day-to-day challenges and needs.’ Jaakko Kouhia, Dealer Support Manager, Tana.



Tana applies the knowledge gathered in Finland to local conditions abroad. Even though waste management operators around the world share some basic challenges, the processed materials and required particle sizes vary significantly. With Tana, the same machines can be used for different purposes depending on each country’s needs. Tana regards its long tradition in the manufacturing of waste processing technology as one of its strengths and expects steady growth into the future.",United Kingdom,2019.03
575,Coca-Cola Co's plastic packaging output dwarfs FMCG rivals,"The Coca-Cola Co produces almost twice as much plastic packaging as food giant Nestle, it has revealed as part of a commitment to reduce waste.

Disclosing the figures for the first time, Coca-Cola said it creates 3m tonnes of plastic packaging a year. The number was the highest of the 36 companies and organisations that published their packaging volumes in an Ellen MacArthur Foundation report, released today.

In comparison, Nestle produces 1.7m tonnes a year while Diageo makes 40,000 tonnes. Danone produces 750,000 tonnes every year.

In the report, Coca-Cola underlined its commitment to reducing the plastic footprint through its World Without Waste programme, launched last year. Coca-Cola aims to use 100% recyclable packaging by 2025, and to phase out single-use packaging ""where relevant"".

""Although we have only recently passed the one-year mark since launch of our World Without Waste programme, we have made a great deal of progress towards implementing action,"" the group said.

Coca-Cola was one of only 16 consumer goods companies - out of 46 in the Ellen MacArthur report - to release plastic output data. PepsiCo, Pernod Ricard and Kellogg Co did not disclose volumes.

A spokesperson for Coca-Cola said the information in the report was made public over the course of 2018 and 2019. ""We'll continue this type of proactive reporting on our World Without Waste progress as we work to hit our goals by 2030,"" the spokesperson added.

The Ellen MacArthur Foundation was set up in 2009 to help businesses work towards a circular economy. More than 150 companies are signatories to the foundation's New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, including Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Nestle. In 2013, Coca-Cola was the first global consumer goods company to join the foundation's attempt to sign up 100 businesses to its circular economy plegde.

In today's report, the foundation praised the companies that revealed their plastic footprint, saying it marked ""an important step forward to create transparency"".

""We encourage all businesses that make and use plastics to provide full transparency on their plastics footprint, including, for example, total tonnage, number of items, and breakdown by geography and packaging format and material type,"" it added.

583,House brick can become circular economy champ,"By Professor Gabriela Medero, School of Energy, Geoscience, Infrastructure and Society at Heriot Watt University and a recent finalist in the 2018 Converge Challenge, an academic entrepreneurship company creation programme

FOR true innovation, the construction industry needs to look at Scotland’s universities and research institutes. They remain a hotbed of dynamic, fertile creativity and for many years, many of these institutions have been researching and developing new products and practices that place a strong emphasis on sustainability and the circular economy.

At Heriot Watt University where I am based, I have spent a long time researching building materials and have been concerned that the modern construction techniques used by the industry exploits raw materials without considering that they are amongst the largest contributors to carbon emissions – materials such as cement and concrete – and indeed, the amount of waste they produce is not sustainable long-term.

Look around any demolition site and you will see mountains of waste – generic, inert waste rubble – an amalgam of different building materials, which will end up in landfill, but of course changing legislation will mean this cannot simply be disposed of at a landfill site.

Moreover, rubble taken to landfill does not decompose – inert materials will simply lie dormant. At one time, the taxes for landfill was a cheap solution to transport demolished materials, but successive governments soon levied higher taxes. The construction industry needed to find ways to increase the percentage of recycled materials used in new building developments, to (i) alleviate the pressure on landfill sites and (ii) start breathing fresh life into the circular economy.

Having researched various recycling materials and through discussions with organisations such as Hamilton Waste and Recycling, SEPA and Zero Waste Scotland, I successfully applied for an innovation voucher from Interface which forges links and collaboration between business and the university academic research community, to evaluate using construction demolition waste and turning this into a viable recycled building material product. The exhaustive research concluded that the potential was significant.

Zero Waste Scotland agreed more funding through its Innovation Fund and further market assessment confirmed the research work that a brick made from recycled building waste materials would pass stringent legislative criteria and certification.

Part of this assessment was satisfying SEPA’s certification criteria which required ‘end of waste’ position for turning building waste recycled into a new building material.

They required assurances on the composition and quality of the recycled material that would be used and having achieved this, the business I formed to develop the product – Kenoteq – is now the only company that has approval to ‘up-cycle’ building waste and turn this into a recycled building brick.

Extracting clay from ground and the process of firing a brick at 1300 Centigrade is clearly unsustainable when we have the vision and potential to recycle for use back into the construction site

This is the new circular economy in practice. It is effectively a closed loop circular economy and the need in construction for this is significant. Traditional concrete blocks carry a high proportion of cement which has one of a highest concentrations of carbon emission.

The developed recycled prototype brick – the K-Briq – is not energy demanding as traditional bricks. It looks like a normal brick – it weighs the same and behaves like a brick albeit with better insulation properties, but the normal characteristics are largely the same as you would expect. However, it is sustainable. It is not kiln-fired – it is air dried, so in terms of carbon emissions, it has one tenth carbon emission of normal building materials, and this represents massive savings in terms of energy consumption and related taxes as well as for the environment too, given the costs associated with very high energy demand of fired/kilned clay bricks.

The next stage of the development is more rigorous testing. We started discussions with Construction Scotland Innovation Centre, to build a small demonstration rig – a walled structure that enables us to constantly monitor all the K-Briq properties for strain, strength, water absorption, moisture, quality, humidity, durability and insulation. In March, we will increase this to a 60 metre square building following a consultation with partners Hamilton Waste Recycling and Wilde and Wilde Architects.

Kenoteq has invested in machinery that can produce three million bricks per year. In the past year the team have produced thousands of bricks and tested up to destruction and this coincides with our decision to spin out the business from Heriot Watt University. The first truly recycled bricks will be available to the construction industry in July 2019.This has been an incredible journey for the business. Taking an idea that ticks all the boxes to produce a building materials product from construction/demolition site rubble is visionary and is a profound sense achievement for the business. The construction industry knows about K-Briq and I’m confident the order books will reflect this initial interest.

The Scottish Government has set very high targets for housebuilding with 50,000 new homes earmarked for construction in the next three years, whilst across the UK, some 200,000 a year, are to be built. Last year, 85% of the bricks used in Scotland were imported, where at one time, Scotland could boast more than ten brick manufacturers. We now have only one full-time clay brick manufacturer. This says so much about manufacturing home-grown building materials for the construction industry and there is now a real reason to change perceptions.

The K-Briq reflects Scotland’s pioneering circular economy initiative. Just the like the country is largely serviced by renewable wind energy, there is every hope the future of our construction industry can be well served by building materials which have been recycled and comply with the most stringent regulations and certification.",United Kingdom,2019.03
584,BLOG: Australian Labor Party War on Waste a Step in the Right Direction,"Mike Ritchie, managing director of MRA Consulting Group and a prominent advocate for waste reform in New South Wales (NSW) has welcomed Australian Labor Party (ALP) policy to invest waste levy funds back into the circular economy.

“The Recycling and War on Waste policy released by Michael Daley and Penny Sharpe is an important step towards creating the circular economy and achieving a more sustainable balance between the economy and the environment,” he said.

Ritchie welcomes the commitment to maintain “approximately one third of the revenue raised by the waste levy “($250m/yr since the levy raises $760m/yr) to fund waste, regulatory and environmental programs.”

The commitment to invest the remainder of the levy funds (over $500m/yr) in a new Circular Economy Job Creation Investment Fund is a “sensible way to use the levy revenues for the long term benefit of recycling,” he said. ""There is a massive shortfall between the current State recycling targets and the infrastructure needed to achieve them. “Ultimately we need to spend more money on waste infrastructure now if we want to achieve the targets.

“At the moment the ALP commitment to the Investment Fund appears to be on top of Waste Less Recycle More (WLRM) funding. Current WLRM is almost $100m/yr and we would need to see the Fund providing similar funding. My understanding Is that the additional $140m over 4 years promised by the policy will be coming from long term earnings of the Fund. At a 5% interest, the Fund’s $500m would be generating $25m in the first year, $50m in the second and so on.

“Overall, the last thing the industry wants to see is the $760m/yr levy being spent on anything but recycling and waste management. The levy and all the earnings from the fund need to provide for expanded recycling in NSW.

“ALP policy will stimulate the private sector investment needed to hit the NSW state targets of 70% recycling of household and commercial waste, and 80% of construction waste. These are impossible to achieve with the current policy settings and we have been telling the EPA that for years.

“We need at least 36 new waste processing facilities to be built in less than 3 years to achieve those targets. Right now it is unlikely they are achievable but the ALP policy, if fully implemented, would make a big step forward.

“The private sector is ready and primed to invest the $1-2 billion required to drive recycling. This investment will create at least 4,700 jobs in Sydney and half as many again in the rest of NSW. The industry will welcome a resource recovery infrastructure strategy to provide direction for this investment,” Ritchie said.

Ritchie particularly welcomed the Circular Economy Job Creation Fund as it will provide long term funding for infrastructure in the sector.

”It is only through infrastructure such as Food and Garden Organics collection and composting, Materials Recovery Facilities (MRFs), C&I ‘Dirty’ MRFs, C&D processing plants, AWTs, Process Engineered Fuel facilities and the like, that we can achieve the big recycling outcomes we need. We need to increase recycling rates by millions of tonnes not a few thousand. It is nice to recycle coffee cups but they are a tiny contributor to waste to landfill,” he said.

He welcomed the decision to split the roles of Chairperson and CEO of the EPA and to establish a Recycling Resource recovery and Waste Council (hopefully with a seat or two allocated to waste management industry members) to advise the Minister on waste reform.

As always, Mike welcomes your feedback on this or any other topic at ‘The Tipping Point’.

Gardner Denver is inviting those operating in the municipal wastewater treatment industry to attend a free webinar, discussing how plants can play their part in realising the ambitions of the circular economy, while improving the total cost of ownership of a site’s technology too.





Taking place on 28 March, the live webinar will be led by Russell Frost, EMEAI Market Sector Manager at Gardner Denver, and those interested can register to attend at http://bit.ly/2NXOhRd. Attendees will be able to choose from two webinar times on the day, at either 9:30am or 3:30pm.



The webinar will discuss the latest technologies that can help a municipal wastewater treatment plant reduce its consumption of limited resources and produce less waste, in line with the aims of the circular economy, as well as how these more sustainable solutions can actually improve a plant’s competitiveness.



The webinar will then go onto cover why it is so important that operators prioritise total cost of ownership for a wastewater treatment plant, and the impact it can have on a facility’s bottom line, plus the factors to bear in mind when it comes to specifying a compressed air system for a site.



Those that attend the webinar will have an opportunity to download a free dedicated white paper on this topic too.



Russell Frost explains: “The benefits of a circular economy are numerous, including reduced waste, greater resource productivity, a more competitive economy and more sustainable operations. The move towards the circular economy means organisations will be given far more information about the whole life costs and environmental impact of goods and services, and so the total cost of ownership of machinery and equipment at a wastewater treatment facility should be a key concern for plants.



“In fact, we’ve seen instances where – by embracing more efficient and sustainable technology – a wastewater treatment site has achieved cost savings of £5,000 a month, leading to annual savings of £60,000. This has a huge impact on a plant’s bottom line, not to mention their sustainability credentials because of the technology that has been introduced.



“We want to use this webinar as an opportunity to explain how municipal wastewater treatment facilities can become both more sustainable and profitable.”

It defines the joint working group that will, over the next six months, assess the launching of research projects to produce hydrogen and high-quality biofuels from plastic waste.

The working group will analyse how the market of non-mechanically recyclable packaging will evolve in the next few years. They will study the types of waste that can be used to develop a positive, innovative circular economy process and maximise recovery, in line with new EU directives.

In sorted waste, plastic packaging is separated and sent to be recycled so it can be reused, mostly by transforming it into chips or grains, which then become raw material for creating new products. But not everything can be recycled. Plasmix is the collective name for the different plastics in used packaging that currently have no use in the market of recycling. Almost all of it goes towards energy recovery, apart from a small fraction that ends up in landfill. Thanks to the agreement between Eni and COREPLA, some of it can instead be recycled and transformed into new raw material.",United Kingdom,2019.03
614,Ecology versus the economy?,"This is one reason why we have no choice but to fight climate change and stop the degradation of biodiversity with every means we can think of. We must urgently stop over-consuming the natural resources our only planet provides us with.

The good news is that we can do this. Transforming our economies into low-carbon circular economies will even increase their competitiveness. According to a recent report by the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and the Finnish Environment Institute SYKE economic wellbeing measured by the GDP would increase in all four low-emission scenarios presented in the study. In order to maintain adequate social benefits and good quality public services, such as health care and free education, which are the corner stones of our society, we do need a flourishing economy too.

Circular economy is a key part of the solution. It will help us decouple economic growth from CO2 emissions and the use of natural resources. In the future products must be designed and produced so that they are reusable, repairable, more durable and in the end recyclable. This way the use of virgin raw materials will diminish. Fossil materials will be replaced with renewable ones. Single use plastics are on their way to history and more and more plastics are already being replaced with products made of wood and recycled materials. In the future we will share more and own less. The yellow city bikes and shared vehicles are just a beginning. Circular economy will also boost our economic competitiveness. According to a report by the Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra, circular economy holds an annual economic growth potential of 1,5-2,5 billion euros by the year 2030.

The economic revolution forces us to rethink policies. As a former entrepreneur I find it important to drive economic policies that produce a conducive environment for businesses of all sizes to develop their activities as well as support the creation of new, low-carbon business models. Our labour laws must allow micro-entrepreneurs to employ people at a reasonable risk and international professionals to develop motivating careers in Finland. Taxation needs to be an even stronger driver of fossil free and circular development. Our waste, chemical and product legislation needs to enable the development of circular economy products and services safely.

Turning our societies and economies to a sustainable path will necessitate massive systemic changes that can only be achieved with consistent policy-making and broad societal participation. One key task for us decision makers is to make sure that the necessary transition will be a fair one, to everyone. We will succeed or fail together.

617,A new political group to change Europe,"Italy’s Five Star Movement aims to build a new, post-ideological group within the next European Parliament to get the EU back on track, proposing more direct democracy tools and deep reform of the Eurozone, with a strong focus on growth, environmental protection and youth unemployment, writes Fabio Massimo Castaldo.

Fabio Massimo Castaldo is the Vice President of the European Parliament and a Five Star Movement MEP.

In the last ten years, the EU has been confronted with important challenges and it has failed to successfully cope with most of them.

First of all, the economic crisis has been dealt with an injection of austerity and pro-cyclical economic interventions, which has worsened the situation.

Economic divergence, both within and among the member States, has increased and the damage caused by this approach perpetuated by traditional political forces is particularly evident in the Greek case.

The member states’ self-interest has largely prevailed, against the principle of solidarity enshrined in the Treaties, leaving European politics stuck in a state of permanent stalemate.

The European People’s Party (EPP) and the Socialist and Democrats (S&D) are the parties bearing most of the responsibilities of the current crisis of identity that Europe is facing.

We need to change to get the European Union back on track. This is why we are working to build a new group.

On 15 February, the Five Star Movement’s leader Luigi Di Maio presented a new alliance with Croatia’s Zivi Zid, Poland’s Kukiz 15, Finland’s Liike Nyt and Greece’s Akkel.

On 26 May, our group will include additional parties and together we want to return Europe to its citizens.

The first aspect of this new coalition is its post-ideological character. The traditional right-left political spectrum has shown to provide empty labels, as the main traditional groups in the European Parliament equally share the responsibility for the current decline of the EU’s popularity and, therefore, of the European project.

Citizens have increasingly felt excluded from decisions taken in Brussels, as these have often gone in a direction contrary to what they needed, but also because of the lack of transparency that characterizes the working methods of the Council in particular.

And the European Parliament, the only directly elected institution of the EU’s architecture, is today the sole Parliament in the world to which no legislative initiative power is granted.

Moreover, notwithstanding the opportunities of participation offered by technological progress, the only European direct democracy tool, the Citizens’ Initiative is, at present, almost unusable.

We want to combat corruption and transnational organized crime, but we also want to protect the real economy from the power of financial markets.

Furthermore, austerity policies, which caused huge damage to many EU citizens are to be substituted by a strong engagement of the public sector in order to foster research and development.

Deep reform of the Eurozone is fundamental to reach convergence among the member states. We have to focus and find solutions for growth and unemployment and stop and contain the dangerous effects of a globalization process which has been ill-managed so far.

The starting point of every national economy has to be taken into consideration and each of them must be supported to converge towards the highest common standards.

Environmental protection is fundamental, together with the promotion of public health, both are essential elements that must be guaranteed to European citizens through a durable and comprehensive policy.

Energy transition and the promotion of a circular economy have always been at the core of our political platform, as they are indispensable for the survival of our planet.

The same applies to the protection of biodiversity and the refusal to allow GMOs in agriculture: supporting local agriculture as well as the protection of “made in” products and ‘national excellences’ are our key goals.

Finally, we want to invest in our young citizens and their skills: youth unemployment is a priority for us, as young people are the engine of the European economy and they, all of them, have to be given the best opportunities possible.

Now is the time to change. We want to be this change that European citizens are looking for.",Belgium,2019.03
621,"""E-mobility creates more potential than problems.""","Mr Hannon, at the IARC 2019 you will be talking on the topic of “Mobility’s Circular Economy Potential”. The title of your presentation suggests that the potential of the circular economy in the mobility sector is far from exhausted. Are we right on that point?

 Over the last few years, the automotive industry has made a great deal of progress in terms of sustainability. Cars are among the most recycled products worldwide and the recycling rate in Germany is over 90%. However, we still have a long way to go to achieve a genuinely circular economy, as it involves a whole lot more than just recycling. In fact, it means changing the entire process chain, including product development, business models and supply chains, to take sustainability into account.

In which field of mobility do you see the greatest potential for the circular economy?

 Four mega-trends are currently impacting the car industry, the so-called ACES: autonomous driving, connectivity, e-mobility and shared mobility. The fundamental changes that accompany these technologies offer us the opportunity for a further revolution, namely the circular economy, as we could actively rethink the way we do things when it comes to new products such as e-cars, but also new business models like car sharing or robotaxis.

How important do you think the topic of circular economy is for carmakers?

 We have already seen in many other industries that the transition from focusing purely on products to a more strongly service-based business model has a great deal of commercial potential. To take an example from the automotive industry, carmakers currently earn around one cent per mile (1.6 km) on the cars they sell, calculated over each vehicle’s life cycle. However, with robotaxis the figure could rise to between 10 and 25 cents and the existing assets, i.e. the vehicles themselves, could be used far more efficiently.

Do you know of any best-practise examples that show how the circular economy can be ideally implemented in the field of mobility?

 As mentioned in that example, mobility services are a good way to use cars for longer and more efficiently. That is one of the key principles of the circular economy. However, we are still only just beginning and so far the circular economy has not been fully implemented. For example, products need to be comprehensively rethought at the design stage, right from the outset, to make them suitable for the circular economy.

In the carmaking industry, electric drivetrains are considered the way forward. Apart from the lithium-ion battery, which other challenges does electric mobility pose for the circular economy?

 Generally speaking, e-mobility creates a lot more potential for the circular economy than it does problems. With around 90% effectiveness, an electric motor, for example, is incredibly efficient in comparison to a combustion engine. Batteries, for example, already provide a promising opportunity for designing a completely circular system – from design to the end-of-life stage. Circular economy concepts are being far more systematically considered in the field of e-mobility than was ever the case with combustion engines.",Germany,2019.03
627,"Europe's Circular Economy ""network of networks"" rises to the challenge of circular transition","More than 350 circular economy stakeholders from across Europe shared their success stories and the challenges they face during the second day of the Circular Economy Stakeholder Conference, hosted by the European Economic and Social Committee on 7 March 2019.

Opening this second day, EESC member Cillian Lohan called on participants to reflect on a key question for the development of the Circular Economy: ""who is going to drive the change? Should it be consumers, business or policy makers: who should go first?""

While all three need to play an equal role once the Circular Economy is implemented , said Lohan, I would argue that in making the initial change responsibility should not be put on the consumer. It is changes in business practices, supported by policy changes and policy infrastructure that will actually create the environment where consumers have the affordable and accessible options that will allow them to make circular, sustainable choices , he stressed.

Smoking provides an example of a massive cultural behaviour change brought about by a change of policy: there has never been a better time to stop smoking than now because all the infrastructure supports you in that , argued Lohan.

Ladeja Godina Košir ,Chair of the European Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform, called on participants to make the most of the Platform as a support network to help solve the problems they encounter in their Circular Economy projects: We want to be the network of networks for everyone. You don't have to be a star and celebrate your success – you can share your worries and problems. We do not have the answers – therefore it is important to ask the right questions. And to have a community where this is allowed .

Joanna Drake, Deputy Director General, DG Environment, stressed the crucial role of stakeholder involvement in the European Commission's Circular Economy initiatives: part of their success is a focus on a bottom-up approach calling on support and engagement with stakeholders through cooperation, platforms, exchanges of best practices and voluntary business approaches , she said. In January, the World Economic Forum rewarded the European Commission for its global leadership on the Circular Economy. We truly feel that this prize belongs to all of you as well.

Discussions split up in 8 interactive workshops focusing on the following topics:

The day closed with the launch of the Kindred Spirits exhibition, displaying the photographs of Suzanne Jongmans that recreate Old Masters with intricate costumes using recycled plastics, old blankets and used packaging.

Participants were also inspired by an unconventional speech on suggestions for navigating what's next in the Circular Economy speech by Rieta Aliredjo, Chair of the Stars-are-circular Foundation: be curious; aware; generous and playful.

Reports with findings from each workshop will be published shortly on the Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform website, while the Kindred Spirits exhibition remains open to visit until March 29th.

629,industriAll Europe | NEWS | IndustriAll Europe adds a social dimension to major EU circular economy event,"IndustriAll European trade union brought the workers’ voice to the EU circular economy stakeholder conference, a large-scale event co-organised by the European Commission and the European Economic & Social Committee on 06 and 07 March 2019.

Policy adviser Laurent Zibell spoke at the event (pictured) about the importance of the social dimension to the success of the circular economy and also distributed 50 copies of our policy brief on the issue. 



The circular economy is a major shift to take place in the production and consumption patterns of industrial products. Its purpose is to maintain their economic and ecological value as long as possible, with longer-lasting products that are maintained, repaired, upgraded before being recycled – while avoiding the final generation of waste. It can bring a major contribution to the mitigation of climate change.

The event celebrated the achievements of the circular economy action plan of 2015: of the 54 policies foreseen, all have either been adopted (e.g. on waste or on single-use plastics) or proposed by the Commission. 



It was also the occasion to broaden the scope of policy reflection and to look forward to the work programme of the next Commission.IndustriAll European, being represented in the Coordination Group of the EU Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform, organised a well-attended panel on the impact of circular economy on employment, where two reports were presented and discussed. 



These reports conclude that the impact should be moderately positive overall, but with a shift from production to maintenance and repair activities.

IndustriAll Europe general secretary Luc Triangle said: “The circular economy can have a very positive impact on European industry, and contributes to mitigate climate change. We must however ensure that the jobs being created in industrial maintenance and repair match the quality of those lost in direct production. We must also design our financial system to make sure that the lease of high-quality, longer-life products remains affordable for.""

634,Making it circular: The role of industries in circular cities,"When Vietnam takes over the ASEAN chairmanship in 2020, the country outlined five priorities to be executed throughout the year. Among all, strengthening the institutional capacity of ASEAN and leveraging the Industrial Revolution 4.0 to address inequality, are the most challenging goals to be realized within a year. Other scholars such as David Hutt, meanwhile, even pointed out that Vietnam’s most important goal is to secure a united stand on the Code of Conduct to be negotiated with China this year ⸺ a consensus that if achieved, will ensure any agreement regarding the contentious South China Sea dispute to be mutually favourable for all the disputants involved.

That said, the unexpected outbreak of the COVID-19 has greatly disrupted Hanoi’s initial ambitions to drive the ASEAN agenda into new heights. Not only the global pandemic postponed the regional bloc’s summits and meetings to later dates, it also compelled leaders of all ASEAN countries to devote great focus on this outbreak at the ASEAN level. While the online Special ASEAN Summit last April was able to result in a joint statement to address the COVID-19 pandemic under the chairmanship of Vietnam, it was by no means, adequate for the country to play an active role as the ASEAN’s driver this year. Given the COVID-19’s disruption to ASEAN’s annual meetings and summits, it is not hard to see why Hanoi is seeking to extend another year of its chairmanship despite this may clash with Brunei’s preparations as the next chairman of the Southeast Asian bloc.

As the country which managed to control COVID-19 and keep it to an excessively low number of transmitted cases, Vietnam has gained an unprecedented confidence among its ASEAN peers as well as those outside of the region. As highlighted by Coleman and Sheehan, Vietnam became a new model of how a developing country can respond to COVID-19 without devoting mass resources for the purpose. Dubbed as low-cost COVID-19 strategy as coined by different scholars, the Vietnamese success stemmed on its abilities on three fronts: mobilizing all segments of society in responding to the crisis, initiating early prevention measures (mask-wearing policy, targeted testing, contact tracing and quarantine) and utilizing different technologies (website and app) for public communication.

With such coordinated measures, Vietnam has cast itself as an exemplary model in controlling the pandemic despite not having colossal resources in conducting mass testing and epidemic surveillance of South Korea, China and Singapore. As a matter of fact, the Vietnamese COVID-19 response model is a highly attractive model which can be readily emulated by other developing countries with limited resources at hand. Within ASEAN, the Vietnamese model can be replicated in Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar ⸺ countries that would need effective COVID-19 response strategy without their governments devoting huge costs for it. By occupying the ASEAN chairmanship status, its COVID-19 success resonated confidence from the whole regional bloc on its ability to play a leading role in this testing time. To take it further, such gain of confidence within ASEAN, should be further capitalized by Hanoi to implement regional agendas that would bring pragmatic returns to all member states in the short-run.

With the COVID-19 pandemic yet to be effectively controlled around the world and has the capacity to recur in the near future, no one knows how much longer would the restarted economies in the bloclast. This situation, in turn, made the ASEAN Smart Cities Network (ASCN) as reached by the Southeast Asian bloc in April 2018, an ever more important priority for immediate implementation. From Anbound’s observations, there are two reasons for such urgency.

First, with COVID-19 vaccine yet to be developed at least not in the immediate future, reduction in face-to-face engagements has become a norm of human interactions. As such, there is no other choice for ASEAN players, whether they are the governments, businesses and average citizens, but to adapt to this new norm in their daily activities. By pushing for the immediate implementation of the ASCN, Vietnam will be able to utilize technology to rejuvenate the economy and improve the lives of ASEAN citizens in the post-pandemic era.

By all means, this will establish Vietnam’s legacy as the chairman that brings ASEAN out of the socio-economic crisis that was brought by the COVIS-19 pandemic. Considering that the 36 cities have planned their strategic projects within the Smart City Action Plans document, what Hanoi could do is to call for an online meeting with the respective national leaders and relevant city mayors, and designate certain short-term goals to be realized by the end of 2020. These goals can be any easier and achievable goals in the three pillars of technological utilization, industrial automation and digitalization of economy.

Second, similar to becoming a model for COVID-19 response, Vietnam could also become another model of smart cities for the lower developing peers in ASEAN. In the course of adapting smart cities vision to its local conditions, Hanoi can share with their peers on how to kick-start smart cities governance in three different cities with three distinctive needs, namely, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Danang. As a latecomer to the smart cities game, these three Vietnamese cities have demonstrated their capabilities to prioritize smart solutions according to their local needs instead of developing all sorts of smart solutions in their localities.

Whereas Hanoi had started the iParking app for drivers and looking to venture into smart solutions in healthcare, education, transport, and tourism, Danang planned to become a green city through the adoption of smart solutions. As such, the latter’ had begun developing its natural disaster management systems that set it apart from Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. As for the southern city of Ho Chi Minh, it is planning to become the first smart city of Vietnam and placed emphasis on attaining five capabilities for achieving a comprehensive smart city: development of cloud computing infrastructure, utilization of Big Data, building of data centres, erection of security centres, and establishment of an open data ecosystem. Without question, the cost-effectiveness approach of these three Vietnamese cities, is highly relevant to those lower developing peers in ASEAN in which limited resources are available for them.

An Opportunity Not to Be Missed

Within the ASNC vision, Vietnam is provided with an opportunity (not to be missed) in leading ASEAN toward the next stage of economic development. While it may want to gain specific achievements in the other areas of South China Sea issue and ASEAN’s institutional capacity, realizing these goals requires a lot of diplomacy with the other nine member states. With a little more than half year left, it is still challenging for the country to achieve these goals despite it is not an entirely impossible endeavor to start with. Pushing for short-term goals within the ASNC vision, meanwhile, will help Vietnam to get quick result and one that is also vital for the new course of ASEAN’s economic development.",European Union,2019.03
637,AI and robotics could revolutionise municipal waste sorting,"Ferrovial, a leading infrastructure operators and municipal services company, and EIT Climate-KIC partner, is collaborating with start-up ZenRobotics to incorporate AI and robotics into the company’s municipal solid waste plants.

Europe will have to recycle 55 per cent of all municipal waste by 2025, according to a ruling passed by the European Parliament last year. For context, less than 30 per cent of all waste generated in Spain was recycled in 2016. It’s therefore increasingly necessary for all potentially recoverable waste to get recycled.

While waste sorting is a highly automated process in Europe, several tasks are still carried out manually in order to sort and recover valuable materials in the waste stream. Such tasks include the quality control of recovered materials and the separation of bulky waste. Workers are exposed to risks due to direct contact with waste. Additionally, waste sorting is a job that requires repetitive movements, which are hard on the human body.

Robotics and AI are innovations uniquely poised to improve the quality of work and health conditions of employees since exposure to waste will be reduced. These innovations will also increase the rate and quality of recovered waste that will re-enter production processes as secondary raw materials, thereby reducing the demand for completely new raw materials as well as the pollution associated with the manufacturing and extraction of such raw materials. Ferrovial decided to collaborate with start-up ZenRobotics for this reason—to support the transition to a circular economy.

“The successful implementation of the ZRR for Municipal Waste project could also have a positive impact on plant workers’ jobs, which are often repetitive, unpleasant, experience high-turnover and are risky. The work will transform into automated systems management and troubleshooting—high-value jobs based on technology,” said Rafael Fernández, Director of Digital Strategy and Innovation, Ferrovial. “Automation technologies will also create new occupations that don’t exist today, much as past technologies have done.”

How does it work?

The Zen Robotics Recycler (ZRR) robot is equipped with numerous sensors, including machine vision, which continuously monitor the waste stream. The AI recognises the desired materials and the industrial robotic arms, called grippers, pick out these materials quickly and precisely.

ZenRobotics technology has been tested in construction and demolition waste sorting, where it’s achieved rates of 2,000 picks per hour per gripper and purity rates of 98 per cent in separated streams. The technology has demonstrated its capacity to separate bulky items weighing up to 30 kilograms.

However, significant differences between construction and demolition waste and municipal solid waste streams mean the technology’s implementation at a municipal waste sorting plant requires adaptation: This is what is being undertaken in the project and is the first time the technology has been applied to municipal solid waste sorting. To address this challenge, Ferrovial is working with the Wuppertal Institute for Climate Environment and Energy.

“The robot training with municipal wastes is advancing favourably,” said Vicente Galván, Director of the Center of Excellence for Environment, Ferrovial. “Some preliminary results point to a good performance of the technology. Final results can be expected in July, once the testing phase is over.”

The robot was recently installed at the Ecoparc4 plant in Els Hostalets de Pierola, Barcelona, which is managed by Ferrovial’s services subsidiary. The installed unit features two consecutive robotic arms and will initially be trained to identify up to 13 different materials. It’s envisaged that the system’s capacity will be subsequently expanded and that it will be able to identify new materials in the waste stream via updateable, smart, self-learning software. The testing and robot learning process will be carried out at the Ecoparc plant over several months.

Following the testing process, if the results are positive, the robot ZRR2 will be put into operation. The system would be installed in the bulky waste reject line above a stream that thus far hasn’t been leveraged for recovery and was being managed for landfilling. The ZRR2’s features and the waste’s characteristics make it of interest to deploy the robot, according to Ferrovial. Through implementing this system, the Ecoparc plans to recover a greater quantity of recyclables as well as new materials which to date were not recovered.

“The ZRR2 is set to become a powerful tool that contributes to ensuring the supply of essential resources in a society whose rate of growth hinders its sustainability,” said Galván.

If the results of the ZRR for Municipal Waste project, supported by EIT Climate-KIC, are favourable, it will enable the technology to be used on other types of waste streams, not only in the Ecoparc4 facility, but also at other Ferrovial waste sorting plants.

Additionally, the project will contribute to the quantification and qualification of circular economy impact. NTU International, a consortium partner, will perform a socio-economic and environmental analysis of the robot’s introduction in the waste treatment facility. The analysis’ results can be expected in November.",Netherlands,2019.03
641,How lost plastics could help us find a circular economy,"With a new report finding plastic pollution on the planet is expected to double by 2030 if we continue with business-as-usual, something needs to change. But where to start?

When it comes to the plastics crisis gripping the planet, there are many tough challenges to overcome that don’t have easy answers – whether that’s the difficulty of recycling certain common forms of plastic, how deeply plastics are interwoven into supply chains, or the environmental impacts of alternative forms of packaging. One good place to begin, however, could be what are known as ‘lost plastics’.

These are the huge quantities of plastic currently going to waste that could actually be recycled today – if only we had the right systems in place to identify, collect, and process them into new products.

The PlastiCity project, part of the EU’s Interreg 2 Seas Programme, seeks to come up with ways to do exactly that. Metabolic is one member of a broad team of partners led by the City of Ghent working to address this problem in the 2 Seas region of Europe; which covers coastal areas connected by the North Sea and the English Channel between France, the UK, Belgium (Flanders), and the Netherlands.

Backed by over €9.45 million in funding – including Europe Regional Development Fund support of over €5.5 million and €42 000 from the Province of Noord-Holland – the project team aims to develop replicable solutions that target ‘lost plastics’ slipping through the cracks, in a bid to increase recycling rates in urban environments in the region from 20-30% to over 50%.

“The PlastiCity project provides a unique opportunity to increase the recycling rates in urban environments, as it encompasses all the steps to make this system circular: from identifying the different material flows, to the logistics and sorting process, recycling and identification of new business models,” says Metabolic sustainability consultant Jorrit Vervoordeldonk. “Metabolic is very eager to work together with the consortium on identifying, testing and implementing strategies in this international context.”

Back on the path to job creation

This isn’t just an environmental issue – there are economic opportunities in moving away from traditional plastic disposal methods towards a circular economy approach that is regenerative and waste-free by design. However, these opportunities are not fully known/understood, collection logistics are not fully developed, sorting facilities are not sufficiently well-equipped, and stakeholders are not fully engaged.

These barriers need to be overcome if the 2 Seas region is to play a key role in the EU strategy for plastics in the circular economy, one part of the Circular Economy Action Plan launched in 2015. The EU says the plan has helped put Europe back on the path to job creation, with over four million workers employed in sectors relevant to the circular economy – a 6% increase compared to 2012.

Objectives for PlastiCity include creating 100-400 jobs through circular business activity, coming up with strategies for (reverse) logistics and reprocessing, changing attitudes towards and capacity for recycling via urban platforms, as well as developing new value chains and designing new products by unlocking the full potential of offices, retail, and schools, among others.

Four cities in the 2 Seas region have been chosen to serve as case studies: Ghent in Belgium, The Hague in the Netherlands, Southend-on-Sea in the UK, and Douai in France. The cities will host development of four new value chains with business cases, the design of four new products, and initial investments. A mobile recycling facility the size of two shipping containers will be deployed between the four cities to separate, process and test plastics.

To achieve the objectives, the project envisages the creation of PlastiCity hubs featuring a local network of relevant partners and physical infrastructure, supported by a digital environment/Urban Platform.

The project also seeks to deliver a methodology that yields tailored solutions for logistics, and to lump waste streams together with optimized balance between quantity and quality of plastic collection and reprocessing, as well as a replicable model to create capacity for plastics in the circular economy through urban platforms (with digital data management) and new business models.

Partners on the project include Universiteit Gent, Van Werven België bvba, DPL Group Plastic Recycling, and the GRCT, in Belgium/Flanders; the University of Portsmouth Higher Education Corporation and the Southend on Sea Borough Council in the UK; the Gemeente Den Haag and Metabolic in the Netherlands; Team2, Theys Recyclage, WeLOOP and the Association pour la Recherche et le Développement des Méthodes et Processus Industriels in France.

642,Accelerating the transition to a circular economy,"A new report, “Accelerating the transition to a circular economy: Improving access to finance for circular economy projects,” provides key recommendations to drive increased investment in circular economy initiatives. The study was authored by the European Commission Expert Group on Circular Economy Financing, of which EIT Climate-KIC is a member.

Like with any systemic change, the transition to a circular economy requires pressure on the right levers to trigger a system redesign: This means working across multiple disciplines simultaneously, rather than single point interventions.

The inertia and resistance of current linear economic systems prevent the transition from occurring. Concerted actions by a variety of stakeholders are needed: Governments at all levels, businesses, innovators, investors and consumers all have to play their distinct roles and contribute to the process.

When it comes to finance, most banks and other investors look to innovation to bring change, but avoid the unknown by favouring linear models. But not all of them: More and more financing institutions are recognising that new circular business models can actually reduce risk. However, the rules are not yet written—this is why DG RTD set out to bring together a group of experts to begin the process and explain why the traditional criteria for investment must evolve, and how.

Cliona Howie, EIT Climate-KIC, has been working for over a year in the European Commission Expert Group on Circular Economy Financing. This small, diverse group is made up of circular economy experts from a range of institutions, including those from the financial sector such as the European Investment Bank and other national banks interested in progressing towards a circular economy.

The ambition of the group was to come up with a very specific set of recommendations to actors responsible for financing and designing policy for the circular economy transition, and address circular economy promoters to improve the bankability of projects.

After more than a year of hard work, the group has published a report with those recommendations in a report titled: “Accelerating the transition to a circular economy: Improving access to finance for circular economy projects”.

The paper presents the summary of the discussions in the expert group and proposes three sets of recommendations that, if implemented, should together provide a framework that significantly improves access to finance for circular economy projects.

Actions range from rather technical and short-term measures, for example developing a definition of what constitutes a circular economy project, to long-term and complex measures involving legislative changes at EU and national level. However, these recommendations should be seen as a whole, addressing the main problem—the risk associated with circular economy projects—from different perspectives and by different actors.

The publication is timely, as EIT Climate-KIC led project CICERONE sets out to identify opportunities in the circular economy for a variety of stakeholders, including both investors and projects promoters (SMEs, NGOs, public-private partnerships, etc.). Cliona Howie specifically helped shape the section dedicated to recommendations for circular economy promoters.

645,Coca-Cola India going for Fruit Circular Economy,"Coca-Cola India has a new ambition; to become a complete beverage company. This means providing more choice to the consumer by offering newer beverages and many based on fruit and fruit juices. This would be the concept of the circular economy, or a virtuous economic cycle. This initiative will create a spurt in the company’s local procurement of fruit and farm level interventions and will have a positive impact on the Indian horticulture ecosystem. The two key components of this project are, launching new and innovative products and sustainable sourcing.

Product innovation and taking them to market is handled by Asim Parekh VP, Fruit Circular Economy, Coca-Cola India: “To spark the change we’re bringing many other drinks like tea, coconut water, and juices to our customers. We are launching several new local brands at various price points and for different customer categories. In fact, we are now emulating a start up with 17 brand launches in 2018 and many more slated for 2019. We have made small teams that are quick to innovate, quick to market and adapt. Our core philosophy aided by a sustainable supply chain is about reaching customers and mapping their journeys in detail.”

This way of functioning is a big shift and is rooted in the understanding that India is not exactly a homogenous country: Besides social and cultural diversity, there is economic classification. In addition, the modern consumer in big and small cities and even semi-urban areas wants personalization of their products and services. Keeping the potential growth of the economy in mind, even seemingly small customer segments could be large value generators, says economictimes.indiatimes.com.",Netherlands,2019.03
648,"Circular economy policy should focus on management, not eradication - UK govt","LONDON (ICIS)--Measures to stem the tide of plastic waste should focus on management of resources rather than on outright bans of products, a representative for the UK government’s environment agency said on Thursday.

Improving collection of waste plastics and making the value chain more circular should be the focus of new legislation introduced, according to Steven Andrews, deputy head of resources and waste at the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).

“It is not a war against plastics, it’s a war against plastic waste,” he said, speaking at the IdentiPlast conference in London, UK.

The UK uses 5m tonnes of plastic every year, of which half is packaging material, and 3.7m tonnes of plastic waste is produced annually, Andrews said.

The UK has a target to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste by 2042, and has stipulated that all material placed on the market be recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025.

Whereas France has introduced legislation banning a range of single-use plastics, the UK government is not focused on bans, although the end goal should be to reduce the amount of plastic in circulation, according to Andrews.

“We have introduced [legislation] on production, circulation and simplification… [to] increase producer responsibility, encourage reduction of plastic content and to reduce amount of plastic in circulation,” he said.

The country has four initiatives on reducing plastic waste under consultation until 13 May, including a tax on plastic material containing less than 30% recycled material by 2022, which was dismissed earlier on Thursday by an executive at European chemicals major INEOS as a “blunderbuss” approach.",United Kingdom,2019.03
653,EC publishes report on implementation of Circular Economy Action Plan,"The European Commission has published a comprehensive report on the implementation of the Circular Economy Action Plan. The Plan was adopted in December 2015, the report on all 54 actions under the plan was published on 4 March 2019. According to the Commission, all actions have now been delivered. The report presents the main results of implementing the action plan and sketches out open challenges to paving the way towards a climate-neutral, competitive circular economy where pressure on natural and freshwater resources as well as ecosystems is minimised.

The Action Plan on the Circular Economy sets out measures to ""close the loop"" of the circular economy and tackle all phases in the lifecycle of a product: from production and consumption to waste management and the market for secondary raw materials. The Action Plan also includes a number of actions that target market barriers or boost circularity in specific sectors or material streams, such as plastics, food waste, critical raw materials, construction and demolition, biomass and bio-based products, as well as horizontal measures in areas such as innovation and investment. In 2018, the European Commission complemented this Action Plan by its second Circular Economy Package, including the EU Strategy for Plastics in the Circular Economy.

The findings of the report are being discussed at the annual Circular Economy Stakeholder Conference taking place in Brussels on 6 and 7 March 2019.",Austria,2019.03

657,How can the industry lead in the circular economy? Material and product passports are just the beginning,"Until recently, few businesses would advertise environmental principles like recycling and re-use, but now it is commonplace for them to brag about their ability to cut waste. At Tarkett, we have long believed in doing our little bit to make a difference for the planet, writes Myriam Tryjefaczka.

We are proud to say that we put in place measures to track the source of our products and materials years before we had even heard of the term ‘the circular economy’. And we feel that our system of material and product passports can inspire sustainable industry practices and show how businesses are responding to the European Union’s environmental challenges.

It was just over three years ago that the European Commission unveiled its Circular Economy Package (CEP) of waste and recycling laws. The good news since then is that Europe has begun its journey to close the loop of design, production, consumption and waste management.

At Tarkett, the circular economy is more than just a buzz phrase. We can see that global trends – from population and emission growth to resource depletion – are straining Earth’s vital systems. Our future depends on using and reusing what we have in a sustainable way. This is a particular responsibility for those of us in the construction industry, which traditionally uses vast resources.

We are serious about our environmental commitments. We believe that we should not just preach about green principles, we should practice them. We apply circular principles to the materials we use in our business, including energy, water, raw materials and more.

For example, 70% of our raw materials do not contribute to resource scarcity, being abundant in nature, rapidly renewable or recycled. And we are, of course, also aware of the carbon impact in our operations.

Our approach on the circular economy is to be as open and transparent as possible on the quality of the materials that we use in our products. By transparency, we mean the disclosure and communication of the chemical content of materials by suppliers and component manufacturers along the supply chain, including to consumers and waste management actors.

This information – about the product, its chemical composition, and the health and environmental risks associated with it – should be available throughout the entire lifecycle of the product, particularly for construction products, which can last for decades.

Tarkett produces some 1.3 million square meters of flooring every day for hospitals, schools, houses, offices and stores, in materials like vinyl, linoleum, carpet, rubber, wood, laminate and synthetic turf. And yet we can trace all the substances we use throughout their material lifecycle.

This is essential if we are to control exposure to substances of concern, deliver safer products and ensure consumer confidence. It is a major prerequisite for a circular economy.

This principle of material and product transparency is gaining support at EU level. There is an increasing consensus on the need for information for both consumers and waste operators. It is spelled out in the EU’s 7th Environment Action Plan, and in the Council’s 2017 conclusions on eco-innovation.

Last year’s European Commission Communication on the interface between chemical, product and waste legislation identified the lack of information as an obstacle to assessing whether materials are safe and fit for purpose. And last September, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling for greater material transparency and that, “a product passport should be introduced as a tool to disclose materials and substances used in products.”

At Tarkett, we have gone beyond compliance with existing EU regulations to introduce what we call a Material Health Statement (MHS). More than a simple list of ingredients, an MHS accurately describes the composition of a product and provides information related to ingredient concentration (chemical molecules), their role in the product, and any health or environmental risks in case of exposure to these substances, notably for the user of the flooring and for those who install the floors.

It is based on an independent assessment of our materials by the Environmental Protection Encouragement Agency (EPEA), the organisation that manages Cradle to Cradle® assessments. 98% of Tarkett’s raw materials (representing more than 3,000 materials) are third-party assessed by EPEA for their impact on people’s health and the environment based on Cradle to Cradle® criteria.

The MHS complements the overall Environmental Product Declaration – which is a summary of the overall product environmental impact. Our experience shows that material and product passports like the MHS can help turn the circular economy into a reality.

We urge the EU to support these transparency tools. It is a message that Tarkett will be taking to the 2019 Circular Economy Stakeholder Conference in Brussels on March 6-7, and to the G7 Alliance for resource efficiency workshop in Paris on March 20-21 (“Tools making value chains more circular and resource efficient”).

A true circular economy is a system designed to restore itself. It is a win-win. It is not only good for our people and the planet, it also makes business sense too. At Tarkett, we don’t just believe in the circular economy. We practise it.

666,Report on the implementation of the Circular Economy Action Plan – European Sources Online,"Report presented on 4 March 2019 by the European Commission on the implementation of the Circular Economy Action Plan adopted in December 2015. On 2 December 2015 the European Commission adopted a package of measures to give a new boost to jobs, growth and investment and to develop a carbon neutral, resource-efficient and competitive economy. The 54 actions under the action plan have now been completed or are being implemented, even if work on some will continue beyond 2019. The action plan promoted for the first time a systemic approach across entire value chains. With it, the Commission has mainstreamed circular principles into plastic production and consumption, water management, food systems and the management of specific waste streams. This was made possible by strong support and engagement of Member States, the European Parliament, the business community and citizens. It has also contributed to moving towards the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This report presents the main results of implementing the action plan. It also sketches out future challenges to shaping our economy and continuing to create a competitive advantage, paving the way towards a climate-neutral economy where pressure on natural and freshwater resources as well as ecosystems is minimised. A full state of play of the action plan implementation is presented in the accompanying Staff Working Document (SWD).",United Kingdom,2019.03
670,Circular Economy Action Plan declared “complete”,"A new report into the European Commission’s Circular Economy Action Plan has determined every action laid out in the plan has been implemented.

The report, published by the Commission yesterday, found that all 54 of the steps toward a circular economy laid out in the Circular Economy Action Plan – first drawn up in 2015 – have either been fully delivered or are in the process of delivery. The Commission has therefore stated that the plan “can be considered fully completed”.

First Vice-President Frans Timmermans, responsible for sustainable development, said: “Circular economy is key to putting our economy onto a sustainable path and delivering on the global Sustainable Development Goals. This report shows that Europe is leading the way as a trail blazer for the rest of the world. At the same time more remains to be done to ensure that we increase our prosperity within the limits of our planet and close the loop so that there is no waste of our precious resources.”

Industry sectors pertaining to the circular economy employed over four million workers in the EU in 2016 – a rise of six per cent in comparison to 2012. The circular economy is also credited with providing new business opportunities: industry activity related to circularity, including repair, recycling and reuse of materials, generated nearly €147 billion in “value added” in 2016.

Vice-President Jyrki Katainen, responsible for jobs, growth, investment and competitiveness, said: “This report is very encouraging. It shows that Europe is on the right track in creating investment, jobs and new businesses. The future potential for sustainable growth is huge and Europe is indeed the best place for an environmentally-friendly industry to grow. This success is the result of European stakeholders and decision-makers acting together.”

In addition to its economic and industrial benefits, the Circular Economy Action Plan is designed to mitigate the effects of pollution and climate change: the EU’s plastics strategies mean that all plastic packaging sold in the EU is projected to be reusable or recyclable by 2030. The report notes, however, that action needs to continue on an EU-wide level in order to fully “close the loop”; both in order to further reduce waste and to increase the market benefits for EU businesses.",European Union,2019.03

686,Grand prize of $100k up for grabs in Circular Economy 2030 contest,"The winner of the Circular Economy 2030 global sustainability contest launched last week by SAP and Google Cloud will receive over $100 000 in prize money and get to take part in a Google Cloud for Startups’ Bootcamp.

Through the contest, launched last Thursday (28 February), SAP and Google Cloud are seeking revenue-generating ideas that use data analytics and machine learning to power circular economy businesses. Applications close on 17 March.

The term “circular economy” — where consumption and emissions are minimised through such things as recycling, reuse, refurbishing and repair — has gained ground at a global level.

The Global Footprint Network estimates that in 2018 the global demand for resources was 1.7 times more than what the Earth could support. By 2030 it calculates that humans may need two Earths to sustain the current way of life.

In addition, 2015 research by Accenture, estimates that a circular economy that increases social well-being and economic output while fostering a healthy environment could generate $4.5-trillion of new economic output by 2030.

In a statement yesterday (28 February), SAP Africa head of CSR Sunil Geness said urgent action is needed to ensure the world corrects to a more “sustainable path” and achieves the ambitions set out in the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

Geness said through its partnership with Google, SAP is hoping the initiative will ignite a “new wave” of innovation among social entrepreneurs, as the two companies search for data-driven and technology-enabled solutions that can help the world “run better” and improve people’s lives.

As part of the Circular Economy 2030 initiative, SAP and Google Cloud are working closely with experts in the fields of circular economy and sustainable development. These include UN Environment, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the World Wildlife Fund, and the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data.

While the Circular Economy 2030 winner will receive $100 000 in prize money, four other finalists will each receive $25 000 in prize money. The finalists will be selected at the Google Cloud Next Conference which takes place between 9 and 11 April in San Francisco.

Thereafter, the finalists will participate in a hackathon on 12 April. Judges will look for original ideas that can benefit any aspect of the global economy.

To be considered for the contest, participants must include in their proposals a viable business model and outline a vision for advancing Sustainable Development Goal number 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). They should also use both SAP and Google Cloud solutions to enable the idea to scale.",United Kingdom,2019.03

A circular economy provides the opportunity to rethink how we make and use the things we need, and allows us to explore new ways of ensuring long-term prosperity.

Circular Economy in Cities focuses on opportunities in three key urban systems - buildings, mobility, and products - and looks at how city governments can work to enable a circular economy transition. The project addresses questions such as:
• Vision: What will the implementation of circular economy principles in cities look like?
• Factsheets: What benefits can a circular economy transition in key urban systems bring to cities?
• Policy levers: What can urban policymakers do to accelerate this transition?
• Case studies: What examples are there of urban policymakers already putting this into action?

721,What impact will Brexit have on the circular economy?,"With the UK set to leave the European Union in less than a month, Aidan Bell, co-founder of sustainable materials company Envirobuild, contemplates the impact this might have on the circular economy.

The circular economy centres around the idea of maximising the longevity and potential of our resources in order to minimise waste and use of virgin materials. It centres around a regenerative approach to materials and as a result, recycling is a core component.

Around 80% of the UK’s environmental laws have been created by the EU, including the Europe-wide target for 50% of household waste to be reused or recycled by 2020. Environment Secretary Michael Gove has affirmed that the environment will not be worse off after Brexit, arguing that it could even create a space for environmental innovation. Defra (the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) will manage Britain’s resource policy after the 29th March, however, whether they will have to adhere to the EU’s circular economy strategy will depend significantly on the Brexit deal the UK achieves.

A brief history of recycling in the UK

Progress in the UK in terms of recycling has vastly been as a result of EU regulations.

Before the early 2000s recycling was not integral to UK society both in culture and policy. This began to change with the Waste Strategy 2000 and eventual introduction of statutory recycling targets, both stemming from EU law. In 2011 Defra’s Review of Waste Policy in England included 13 sustainability commitments towards a zero-waste economy which also largely came from EU legislations.

In recent years recycling rates in the UK have stalled and between 2016 and 2017 municipal waste recycling fell to 43.7%. As a result, the UK is already unlikely to reach the EU’s 50% target for 2020, set out in the Waste Framework Directive of 2008.

The European Union’s latest Circular Economy Package (CEP), published in 2018, demands that all plastic packaging must be recyclable by 2030, while the Revised Legislative Framework on Waste requires 70% of packaging waste to be recycled by 2030 and 65% of urban waste by 2035.

Even though the UK will be leaving before this fully comes into force, Gove has maintained his commitment to these targets. However, without EU pressure, if these goals are not fully converted into UK law, it seems highly likely that the UK would fall behind them.

The impact of different Brexit scenarios on the circular economy

The legislative relationship between the UK and EU will depend on how Brexit negotiations pan out over the next few weeks.

Little change would come as a result of the UK remaining within the European Economic Area (EEA), also known as ‘soft Brexit’. We would still have to abide by many environmental regulations yet without any say over their creation. This is the case with Norway who, for example, must accept recycling targets from the EEA.

Even if EU legislations were not directly applicable, as in Switzerland’s bilateral agreement, we would still have to meet EU environmental standards such as recycling rates. Likewise, if we wanted to carry on exporting non-recyclable waste to Europe, we would have to adhere to current waste management laws – although this could become too expensive in a no-deal scenario.

In these two cases, and obviously if we were to remain within the EU, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) would still be able to hold the UK accountable to environmental regulations. In the case of a transition period for more negotiating time, something May has been pushing for, the ECJ would likely also retain this power during that time.

It is within the case of a ‘hard Brexit’, or no deal, where the UK will have the greatest scope for environmental change, for better or worse.

In order to enforce environmental law without the ECJ, Gove has proposed an Office for Environmental Protection (OEP). This new independent statutory body will “hold the powerful to account” while “embed[ding] protections for land, water, air and wildlife into policy-making as the UK leaves the EU”.

However, it has been estimated it will not be ready until 2021 and green groups such as Greenpeace, WWF and Friends of the Earth argue the Bill “give[s] the environment and countryside less protection after Brexit than exists now.” Further stating, “There is no commitment to give the proposed new watchdog power to initiate legal action, nor is there any commitment to enshrine vital environmental principles […] in law.”

This type of jurisdictive watering-down by government may come as no shock to those who have witnessed the UK’s recent interactions with EU regulations.

The UK was taken to court by the European Commission in May 2018 due to its continued violation of EU nitrogen dioxide levels, which became a danger to public health. In fact, the UK is more likely to be taken to court over environmental law than any other EU policy. As a result of the large market it is operating within, the EU has the ability to apply powerful sanctions to the UK, such as multimillion-euro fines.

The UK has also shown opposition to EU environmental laws. The EU’s 2035 urban waste strategy was initially resisted, before being committed to in March 2018. Likewise, the UK previously disputed the ban on bee-harming neonicotinoids before finally agreeing in November 2018, which consequently delayed its implementation.

EU legislations have pushed forward progress in terms of the circular economy in Britain. As it stands, the future of the circular economy in the UK hinges most considerably on the type of Brexit deal which Theresa May can attain – if any.

Theoretically a ‘hard Brexit’ could create greater scope for legislative environmental innovation, such as more directed recycling laws. However, developing our own home-grown policies would represent such an enormous task that, from the sheer scale alone, it would likely become difficult for the circular economy standards to be maintained.

Even in the case of a ‘soft Brexit’, and consequently with retaining the circular economy package, we would nonetheless be rendered voiceless in the creation of new European environmental laws in the coming years.",United Kingdom,2019.03
722,Friend of the Sea promotes circular economy in Morocco certifying Cibel sustainable fishmeal and fish oil,"One of the leading canned sardines and mackerel producersin Morocco,Friend of the Sea sustainable since 2012, has obtained the international sustainability certification for its fishmeal and fish oil production.

Cibel is the acronym for Complexe Industriel Bel Hassan, a high-tech production centre for seafood, fishmeal, and fish oil.

This is one of the largest companies in Morocco, with offices and production sites located between Agadir and Tan Tan, and it contributes to the economic development of the entire region.

The company works with a fleet of 23 purse seine and midwater trawl fishing vessels. The fleet is strictly managed under the national fishing plan and it complies with Friend of the Sea requirements thanks to its selective fishing method, no by catch of endangered species and stock kept within maximum sustainable yield.

Friend of the Sea certification was achieved already in 2012 for Cibel sardines and mackerel.

“All our employees strongly believe in our duty to protect the oceans”, said Mohamed El Baissi, General Manager of Cibel. “Marine resources are essential both for their contribution to biodiversity as well as for the sustainability of our economy. This is why Friend of the Sea principles have become part of our company policy”.

In 2018 the company felt the need to meet an increasing market demand for sustainable products and thus Cibel started the process to certify all of its factories, including the fishmeal and fish oil plants.

According to the latest industry data, over one third of fish meal and fish oil originate from trimmings and bycuts from processing lines. This way waste is reduced as well as the pressure on fish stocks.",United Kingdom,2019.03

According to the Global Footprint Network, the global demand for resources was 1.7 times more than what the Earth could support in 2018; by 2030, we may need two Earths to sustain our way of life. In response, the concept of the circular economy, where consumption and emissions are minimised through recycling, reuse, refurbishing and repair, has gained ground at a global level.

According to estimates, a circular economy that increases social well-being and economic output while fostering a healthy environment could generate $4.5 trillion of new economic output by 2030.

Sunil Geness, Head of CSR at SAP Africa, said urgent action is needed to ensure the world corrects to a more sustainable path and achieves the ambitions set out in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. “As a purpose-driven organisation, SAP is deeply committed to embracing the challenge of environmental responsibility and to put technology, people and passion to work to solve some of the bigger issues of the digital age.

Through our partnership with Google, we are hoping the launch of the Circular Economy 2030 initiative will ignite a new wave of inspiration and innovation among social entrepreneurs as we search for data-driven and technology-enabled solutions that can help the world run better and improve people’s lives.”

As part of the Circular Economy 2030 initiative, SAP and Google Cloud are working closely with experts in the fields of circular economy and sustainable development, including UN Environment, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the World Wildlife Fund, and the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data.

Google Marketing Director for Africa, Mzamo Masito, said: “We believe that with the help of modern technology, businesses can become positive catalysts for a more sustainable future. Our partnership with SAP will not only support social entrepreneurship but continue our commitment to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and advancing a circular economy.”

The deadline for submissions is March 17th. Five finalists will be selected and announced at the Google Cloud Next Conference taking place from April 9th to 11th and will compete in a hackathon taking place in San Francisco on April 12th. Judges will look for original ideas that can benefit any aspect of the global economy. Proposals must include a viable business model, a vision for advancing Sustainable Development Goal #12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and should use both SAP and Google Cloud solutions to enable the idea at scale.

The winner will receive more than $100 000 in prize money and benefits, including participation in Google Cloud for Startups’ Bootcamp and one-on-one mentorship, and will be announced at SAPPHIRE NOW on May 7th. The remaining four finalists will each receive $25 000 in prize money.

The British Training Board helps former members of the Armed Forces embark on a new career outside of the military. EFT Consult has partnered with the company to assist in the delivery of a program that will see 100 ex-service personnel trained in the circular economy, facilities management and building services to help them enhance their skills and career prospects.

The program will deliver on the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015, which is a Welsh Government initiative focussed on improving the social, economic, environmental and cultural well-being of Wales. In accordance with this initiative, the training provided by EFT Consult will subsequently offer companies a better working environment, help to reduce waste and improve organisational well-being, all while providing veterans with a fulfilling career and enhanced skills base.

The circular economy is an alternative to the current linear model of take, make, waste. It is designed to help organisations be more prudent with their use of resources – to reuse, recycle, regenerate, and care for the well-being of people, resources and the planet. EFT Consult launched the South West Wales branch of the Circular Economy Club last year, which is a not-for-profit international network of over 3,100 circular economy professionals and organisations from over 100 countries.

“We are honoured to be supporting this great initiative in partnership with The British Training Board. Not only will this training be incredibly beneficial to those making the transition into civilian life or seeking a more fulfilling career after serving in the forces, but it will also improve those organisations that adopt these important principles. This is about creating a truly ethical, responsible and self-sustainable society while giving back to those who have served. “We look forward to seeing veterans and the ex-forces community benefit from this global opportunity within the circular economy and facilities management sectors.”",United Kingdom,2019.06
764,and JA Europe announce the winner of the Circular Economy Award 2019,"Congratulations to the Finnish start-up Cuitu on winning the EIT RawMaterials Circular Economy award at the JA Europe Enterprise Challenge 2019 in Oslo!

Cuitu is a start-up created by students aged from 19 to 30 who have participated in the JA Start Up Programme, a year-long programme during which students gain real experience of the world of business: coming up with a concept for a business, creating and researching a business plan, taking responsibility and being accountable to their shareholders for the running of the company.

We are so grateful for the opportunity to participate in this start-up competition. We were very impressed by the other projects and are so happy that business people see the potential of our company.

This year, more than 17,000 students from 500+ higher education institutions across Europe have participated in the JA Europe Start Up Programme. The students competed at the national level and the winners participated in the grand finale of the 2019 JA Europe Enterprise Challenge on 24 and 25 June, hosted by JA Norway. 15 teams from 14 countries gathered in Oslo to present their start-ups to an international jury composed of representatives of EIT RawMaterials and the EIT (European Institute of Innovation and Technology) community, participate in a stand exhibition and go through interviews with the jury members who assessed their value proposition (financial, social or cultural) as well as the start-up’s potential to grow.

It struck us that a great majority of the start-ups who were present at the 2019 Enterprise Challenge focus on sustainability and the circular economy of raw materials. We were particularly impressed with Cuitu for their creativity, curiosity and high commitment to sustainable materials. Congratulations to the team for winning this year’s EIT RawMaterials Circular Economy Award! Christina Meskers, Senior Manager Open Innovation at Umicore and Chair of the EIT RawMaterials jury

770,Investigation launched into UK e-waste industry,"An investigation has been launched into the UK’s e-waste industry, looking at how it can create a circular economy for electronic goods.

Globally, 44.7 million tonnes of e-waste were produced in 2017, 90% of which was sent to landfill, incinerated, illegally traded or treated in a sub-standard way.

Europe and the US account for almost half of all e-waste globally, with the EU predicted to produce 12 million tonnes by 2020.

Government watchdog, the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC), says the use of electronic devices and equipment has boomed in recent years thanks to advances in technology, materials and software.

It says there are now more devices connected to the internet than there are humans on the planet, something that is predicted to continue – fuelled by rising consumer demand and decreasing costs.

It says this growth has led to a rapid increase in electronic waste (e-waste) and that the UK has an above EU average, producing 24.9kg of e-waste per person, higher than the EU average of 17.7kg.

It says the UK one of the worst offenders for exporting waste to developing countries and it will now be looking at ways to implement a circular economy for electronic goods.

Despite the intrinsic value of e-waste, recycling rates are low and much of the world’s e-waste ends up in landfill, the EAC says.

It also says, while the technology to recover materials and metals exists, it is “expensive and under-utilised”.

Chair of the Environmental Audit Committee, Mary Creagh MP, said: “Our old fridges, freezers, computers, TVs, kettles and mobile phones are piling up in a ‘tsunami of e-waste’.

“New phone launches, cheaper goods, and built-in obsolescence have contributed to the growth of electronic waste in recent years.

“The UK produces more e-waste than the EU average. We are missing EU targets and are one of the worst offenders for exporting waste to developing countries, who are ill-equipped to dispose of it in a socially and environmentally responsible way.

“Our attitude to e-waste is unsustainable and the need for radical action clear.

“We will be investigating the UK’s e-waste industry and looking at how we can create a circular economy for electronic goods.”

The EAC will look at the challenges to recovering materials from electronic waste as well as what steps are being taken to move towards a circular economy in this area and how the UK Government can support this transition.

It will look at the environmental and human health risk from e-waste, as well as secondary markets and incentives to implement these markets.

The investigation will also focus on technology, targets producer compliance schemes and how “fraud” in the UK’s e-waste system can be addressed.

It will also ask questions about what actions the UK Government can take to prevent to the illegal export of e-waste to the developing world.

Electronic waste (e-waste) is hugely valuable, worth at least $62.5 billion annually, the equivalent of the GDP of Kenya.

This value comes from high value metals in electrical components such as gold, silver, copper, platinum and palladium.

Second-hand markets for products such as smartphones are well developed, however, the World Economic Forum has argued that there is “significant room for improvement”.

E-waste can contain up to 60 different metals and chemicals, some of which can be hazardous to human health and the environment, including contaminating soil, polluting water sources and entering food supply chains.

Crude recycling techniques in the developing world, such as burning plastic from goods to harvest the valuable metals, exposes workers to toxic substances and carcinogens leading to health problems.

A recent report from Agbogbloshie, Ghana linked toxins from e-waste to the contamination of chicken eggs with dioxins and PCBs.

Agbogbloshie is a scrap yard and slum where 80,000 residents primarily subsist by retrieving metals from e-waste, some of which originated in Europe.

Despite a ban on e-waste exports to developing countries, 1.3 million tonnes of undocumented goods are exported from the EU each year, according to the EAC.

In February, the UK was ranked as “the worst offender” in the EU by the Basel Action Network. Following the report’s findings, the Environment Agency closed down four illegal waste operators in the UK, the EAC says

The export of e-waste from developed countries to developing countries has been identified as a global challenge with some countries in Africa and Asia becoming key destinations for e-waste dumping.

The UN has called for binding agreements on the classification of waste and stronger national legislation and enforcement.

In May, countries were unable to reach agreement on proposals for sustainable e-waste management under the Basel Convention. These will be reviewed again in 2021.",United Kingdom,2019.06

Facts and figures from the committee:

Electronic waste is worth at least $62.5bn annually, the equivalent of the GDP of Kenya, largely from value of incorporated gold, silver, copper, platinum and palladium.

The UN has called for binding agreements on the classification of waste and stronger national legislation and enforcement. In May countries were unable to reach agreement on proposals for sustainable e-waste management under the Basel Convention. These will be reviewed again in 2021.

The UK produces 24.9kg of e-waste per person, higher than the EU average of 17.7kg. Electronic waste in the UK is managed under the EU’s Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive and The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Regulations 2013.

A collective producer responsibility scheme exists. This means producers have a financial responsibility for the end-of-life of their goods, calculated by market share, but do not have to reprocess their own goods. Collections are carried out via household waste recycling centres and take back schemes run by retailers or local authorities. Defra sets annual targets for the collection of WEEE across a range of categories.

These are calculated based on the WEEE Directive’s target of 65% of the average annual weight of electrical and electronic equipment placed on the market over the previous three years. The target for 2019 has been set at 550,577 tonnes, a 12% increase on 2018 levels. The UK missed its WEEE collection target by 45,000 tonnes in 2018.

The Government has committed to publishing a review of the 2013 WEEE Regulations this year and consulting on changing WEEE by the end of 2020. This consultation will consider incentives for sustainable product design and increased recycling. It has also committed £8m in funding over the next three years to support research, behaviour change and local projects to boost reuse and recycling.",Ireland,2019.06

The aim of the programme is to facilitate the transition by Swedish manufacturing industry to a circular economy.

Business and academia collaborate to facilitate the transition by Swedish manufacturing industry to more resource-efficient solutions.Mistra REES, where “REES” is an acronym for “Resource-Efficient and Effective Solutions”, works to facilitate the transition to a more resource-efficient and circular economy. In a close collaboration between the academic and business worlds, researchers are working with partners to develop resource-efficient products, services and business models.The programme started in 2015 and has now undergone evaluation by an international panel of experts, whose assessment is one of fulsome praise. The results from the first four years are considered to have been published with high productivity, and to have been disseminated not only to relevant courses of education at universities but also to key actors in society. The management and organisation of the programme have functioned well, according to the experts. Thus, the programme has been awarded financing for a further four years from the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research, Mistra.“We are incredibly happy that Mistra retains its confidence in us, and made it possible to deepen our research into resource-efficient solutions”, says Mattias Lindahl, professor at LiU and programme director for Mistra REES.In addition to the grant of SEK 47 million from Mistra, the universities and partners will contribute a further SEK 29.5 million, giving the programme a budget of at least SEK 76.5 million.“During the first four years we have focussed on examining business models, design strategies, and policies for resource-efficient solutions. In the second phase of Mistra REES, we intend to create in-depth knowledge about the design of products, services and business models, and to propose political measures for more resource-efficient and circular solutions. We hope to be able to implement and test these measures in practice”, says Mattias Lindahl.Phase 2 of Mistra REES consists of three research projects, where Tomohiko Sakao, associate professor at LiU, is responsible for the largest: “REES design support at a company level”. The other two are “Policy and laws affecting REES in companies” led by Carl Dalhammar of Lund University, and “Environmental and Financial Assessment of REES”, led by Maria Ljunggren Söderman of Chalmers University of Technology.

Mistra REES is coordinated by Linköping University and collects researchers from LiU, Chalmers University of Technology, and the International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics at Lund University. More than ten senior researchers and ten doctoral students have been involved from the start. Around 15 small and large companies and organisations will participate in the second phase, and their involvement is necessary to reach the overall goal of increasing the pace of transition for Swedish manufacturing industry to more resource-efficient and circular solutions.

801,The plastics circular economy,"During the first episode of the BBC’s long-awaited series War on Plastic, television chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and presenter Anita Rania shed new light on how vast our plastic problem has become.

In one of the starker moments of the show Fearnley-Whittingstall found discarded packaging from some of the UK’s best-known brands as he explored a major landfill site in Malaysia.

He said: “When we put [these items] in our recycling back in the UK, we think we’re doing the right thing. I really want to know who’s responsible for this horrendous mess. Is it our local councils? Is it our Government? Is it our supermarkets? Is it the manufacturers of these goods? They’re all in it together.”

Viewers were left with a prevailing sense that despite increasing efforts at recycling, there is still no guarantee that their waste will actually end up being recycled.

The UK is unable to recycle the vast amount of packaging it produces and much of it is sent abroad with the intent that it will be recycled and made into a new product. As the episode exposed – in reality – much of this waste ends up in dump sites around the world.

Measures are needed to ensure that waste material that does end up in the natural world are either recovered or recycled.

The 3R Initiative – which stands for Reduce, Recover and Recycle – brings together business giants Nestlé, Danone, Tetra Pak and Veolia, in a bid to both standardise and hasten efforts in tackling waste, plastic or otherwise.

These corporations recognise that once their product is sold, their disposal is at the hands of consumers. And even with increasing numbers of the public engaged with recycling, the bulk of recyclable waste still ends up in landfills or worse – the environment.

With this in mind, the Initiative developed the 3R Project and Crediting Mechanism which provides a crucial financial incentive for the recovery of plastic and other types of waste.

Recycling projects who recover plastic waste, avoiding its release into the environment, will receive credits that can then be sold to businesses mindful of their residual plastic footprint.

Activities that go one step further – and ensure that the waste recovered actually ends up being recycled – will receive a different type of credit, reflecting their contribution to plastic circularity.

The Initiative will also give businesses who participate access to a new standard – the 3R Corporate Standard - which will quantify their efforts to tackle the problem of waste in a standardised and credible way, and independently verified.

The Initiative is being led by Verra, an international standard-setter and BVRio, an environmental market developer, who will develop and manage the standards and program infrastructure.

NGOs Conservation International and project developer South Pole will provide expert advice and give support to the various projects and workstreams that make up the initiative.

The Initiative aims at having a wide membership, with participants from different sectors and inputs.

Giving those on the ground the financial incentive to recover and recycle waste, whilst ensuring that corporations are kept to a consistent standard when measuring their efforts, can support efforts in reducing the amount of waste that ends up in the environment.

802,This campaign wants people to return their plastic to supermarkets with a special note,"People are returning their plastic packaging to supermarkets as part of a new campaign aiming to highlight the threat that single-use plastics pose to the environment.

The campaign, named #OurPlasticFeedback, was launched on Monday’s episode of BBC One’s War on Plastic, in which presenters Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Anita Rani urged viewers to take a stand against major supermarkets and compel them to reduce their plastic packaging.

In order to participate, shoppers are encouraged to unwrap any plastic items at the till and return the packaging to the supermarket with a written note.

Several famous faces have already shared their contributions on social media, including Sir David Attenborough and Prue Leith, who shared an Instagram post of herself holding a piece of plastic packaging with a note that read: “Is this really necessary supermarkets? Bin the plastic please”.

Many members of the public have been sharing their contributions on social media too, returning plastic wrapping for British staples such as Baked Beans and tagging the supermarkets where they purchased them to hold them accountable.

“British staple! @Tesco @HeinzUK do the right thing and please don’t wrap in plastic!” one person tweeted.

Another added: “Dear #Tesco Stop wrapping our fruit and veg in plastic, all this plastic will be returned to you soon! Save our planet!”

The campaign launch comes after several major UK retailers signed the UK Plastics Pact, an initiative spearheaded by the charity Waste & Resources Action Programme (WRAP) that aims to create a circular economy for plastics by ensuring that 100 per cent of plastic packaging is reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025.

Many supermarkets are among the signatories, such as M&S, Tesco, ASDA, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and Waitrose & Partners.

Several of them have already introduced measures to reduce their plastic output. For example, M&S has replaced plastic cutlery with alternatives made from FSC certified wood, Waitrose has committed to stop selling plastic cutlery by the end of this year and almost every retailer has vowed to eliminate plastic straws from sale.

The BBC's docuseries exploring how the public, government officials and corporates are fuelling an unsustainable demand for plastics concluded on Monday (24 June). Here, edie highlights seven key lessons that the series can teach sustainability professionals.

Hugh and Anita’s War on Plastic is a step back from the format used by shows such as Blue Planet 2 and Drowning in Plastic. Less concerned with the global threat of plastic production from the outset, the show sees presenters Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Anita Rani focus on an “average British street” in Redcar to assess just how much single-use plastic the general public have in their homes, where this plastic originates and what it is used for.

From here, viewers are taken on a journey to see how everyday interactions with plastics are wrecking the planet, from Malaysian dumps via hostile security guards at McDonald’s.

The show equips viewers will facts on plastic that are well-versed for those operating in the corporate sustainability sphere. However, the show offers not only an insight into how consumers view plastics, but also how sustainability professionals can use this ever-evolving zeitgeist to push the sustainability agenda to greater heights within their own operation. Here, edie rounds up seven key lessons that Hugh and Anita’s War on Plastics was willing to teach. Enjoy.

Despite the growth in plastics awareness and climate activism, sustainability still isn’t a mainstream differentiator when the majority of consumers choose who they shop with. While they might answer surveys claiming sustainability is an important factor, the War on Plastics series was able to get into the mindset of an everyday shopper, and it is here that sustainability ranks behind cost and convenience.

Between the Redcar 22 homes, residents had amassed 15,774 single-use plastic items. Crucially, almost one-half, or 7,145 of these items, were from the kitchen – mainly in the form of single-use plastic packaging for food and drinks.

Fearnley-Whittingstall estimated that if these findings were scaled up to cover all of Britain, the public are likely to have 19.5 billion pieces of single-use plastic packaging in their homes – almost 8.2 billion pieces of which are likely to be in kitchens. When citing why they purchase single-use plastics, residents responded that it was either more convenient, cheaper or both.

During a meeting with Tesco’s group quality director Sarah Bradbury, Rani placed two sets of three bell peppers from Tesco on the table. One set, the pre-packaged option, was priced at 91p. The loose set cost £1.65. Even by the end of episode three, the number of packaged tomatoes outnumbered loose versions by almost 8:1.

The lesson here is that while small-scale changes are welcome, the public has a predisposition to purchase plastic that won’t change if only sections of the product offering are actually changing.

2) Recyclability is the new greenwash

The McDonald’s website notes that Happy Meal toys can be recycled, as can any battery-assisted toys. “The ‘crossed out' wheeled bin symbol on either the Happy Meal toy or the toy packaging indicates that this is an electronic toy and means that this toy can be recycled rather than disposed of as waste. Battery powered toys will need to go into a designated 'WEEe' bin for waste electronic and electrical equipment,” the company states.

However, during discussions with workers at a recycling facility, it turns out only a “tiny” proportion is actively recycled, and it is rarely economically to do so. In fact, it was revealed that McDonald’s was the biggest distributor of plastic toys, at 1.4 billion annually. While these items are technically recyclable, corporates know that a citizen placing said item into a recycling bin won’t lead to the item being recycled.

As we saw too often during Hugh’s War on Plastics series, corporate responses to plastic queries are a bit too rehearsed. Promises of “absolutely” understanding the issue and willing to implement change at a “competitive price” just leave the public confused and unsure.

Companies need to be willing to explain their plastics strategies in an in-depth and transparent manner that points them towards industry-agreed targets such as the New Plastics Commitment. In a business sphere where science-based targets are now viewed as a necessity, business may want to explore what a science-based plastic strategy would look like.

Collaboration has always been a buzzword for sustainability professionals, but as more businesses incorporate CSR, more partnerships are opening up. Businesses will now find themselves collaborating with companies outside their sector, arguably firms that they haven’t crossed paths with before.

During the first episode, Fearnley-Whittingstall enlists the help of UK truckers to help raise awareness about the lack of refill stations across UK petrol forecourts and service stations. Rather than taking on the battle himself, Hugh leaned on the expertise and social reach of these truckers to create awareness far greater than he could in isolation.

In the battle to save the planet, you’ll find that making unlikely friends will uncover insight that may have been ignored otherwise.

4) Current action is a drop in the ocean

Recent WWF research concluded that the amount of plastics produced, littered and incinerated globally is set to rise “dramatically” by 2030.

The NGO claims that the next 11 years will involve a further 104 million tonnes of plastic “leaking” into ecosystems and the overall CO2 emissions generated through the plastic life cycle increasing by 50%, as plastic incineration trebles and alternatives are introduced before any unintended consequences are examined in full.

For this trend to be reversed, WWF claims, policymakers, businesses and consumers must collaborate to “drastically change” their approaches to the issue. While the edie website focuses on the success stories of brands taking a leadership approach, the BBC series showed that even those brands aren't immune to PR issues - as seen with products and bags from household names ending up in an illegal dump in Malaysia.

The good news is that collaboration on plastics action seems to be becoming more common by the day, with numerous initiatives aimed at helping corporates collaborate on a pre-competitive level having launched since Blue Planet 2. WWF itself recently unveiled ReSource:Plastic – a scheme aimed at helping businesses to translate their plastic reduction pledges into measurable impacts. Other similar schemes include the Plastic Leak Project, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s New Plastics Economy commitment.

If plastics was the zeitgeist of 2018, then the climate emergency has made a strong claim to 2019’s most pressing issue. For sustainability professionals, plastics were viewed as an ideal door into the world of sustainability; a way to make staff or stakeholders more aware of the green transition’s potential impact.

As the final episode showed, there is a murky hidden link between the world of plastics and climate change. Plastics account for 6% of global oil demand and therefore have a great contribution to global emissions. By 2050, the plastic industry could account for 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

For those trying to use either climate change or plastics as a gateway to engage other areas of the business, it isn’t a case of focusing on one or the other, plastics have a key role to play in the battle against climate change, and should be viewed as such.

6) Activism is the next era of sustainability

While current action isn’t ambition enough, there is some good news. Last night’s show focused on the mountain of discarded promotional plastic toys, many of which are freebies from fast food restaurants and magazines. The episode sees two young girls outlining why their petition to get fast good giants such as Burger King and McDonald’s to rethink the environmental impacts of their giveaway toys.

Nine-year-old Ella McEwan and her sister Caitlin, seven, have an online petition that is raising a lot of interest. “It made us very sad to see how plastic harms wildlife and pollutes the ocean, and we want to change this,” the petition reads, which has had more than 167,000 signatures at the time of writing. As Anita puts it, “McDonald’s may have underestimated the power of young girls”.

The action from these two young girls mirrors a growing trend that has already captured global attention in the conversation on climate change. Youth climate strikes, driven by the inspirational Greta Thunberg, have changed the conversation on climate change to one of a climate emergency that has, most recently, been recognised by the UK Government and their new net-zero target.

Through social media and the growing popularity of these environmental docuseries, activism has a 24/7 platform to thrive and grow – a constant and relentless opportunity to knock at the doors of brands and demand action.

In regards to plastic, the public doesn’t view sustainability as a nice-to-have or a differentiator. It’s business critical. Just doing the right thing isn’t enough and brands that can efficiently showcase activism across many CSR areas will likely retain better consumer relations.

7) Circular economy is about the size of the circle

The circular economy is becoming a key business operation, as companies look to move away from the current linear production model.

However, as lead plastics campaigner for Friends of the Earth Julian Kirby, who’s been modelling possible futures for plastics, rightly stated in last night’s episode, production of closed-loop products isn’t accounting for the size of the circular economy. Over a 10-year period up to 2016, global plastic output has increased from 245 million tonnes to 348 million tonnes. According to the PlasticsEurope trade association, production increased by almost 4% in 2017. By 2020, it is expected that the global plastics industry will be worth in excess of $650bn.

Incorporating more post-consumer recycled content or improving the circularity of products doesn’t mean that the world produces less stuff and businesses will need to transition products and services to closed-loop models, but also limit the number of products and services on offer.

Research shows that the stuff we consume — from food to material goods — is responsible for up to 50% of global greenhouse gas emissions and up to 80% of total land, material, and water use. Around 80% of this impact is found down the supply chain of production, as companies seek to fuel the insatiable consumerism demand.",Ireland,2019.06
808,The Bio-Based Economy: What’s Holding It Back?,"Although pollution and climate change are ever increasing problems, breaking society’s addiction to fossil fuels is a daunting task. What are the main obstacles holding European biotechs back from building a more sustainable economy and how can we resolve them?

Modern society’s dependence on fossil fuels is unsustainable. Worldwide, emissions of greenhouse gases show no signs of decreasing, and petrochemical products such as plastics continue to be highly polluting. They will also become more and more expensive over the long run as they become scarce.

“The circular economy is, in my view, imminent,” said Ullrich Stein, Project Manager at Berlin Partner, a company that helps technology companies find funding. “You have to have it because we don’t have infinite resources. The population is still growing. We need to come up with a ‘zero waste theory’ and therefore a circular economy is what we need.”

Policymakers in the EU are well aware of this challenge and have set ambitious sustainability targets for the EU to reach by 2030. These targets include reducing European greenhouse gas emissions by 40% of what they were in 1990, and increasing the amount of renewable energy consumption to 27% of the total.

A great way to meet these targets is to use bio-based sources of chemicals, food additives and fuel, such as algae or bacteria, instead of fossil fuels. Having an economy based on these sources — a bioeconomy — could mean that we generate less waste and use our resources more efficiently.

In spite of their potential, bio-based industries are still the underdog. At the Bionnale conference in Berlin last month, I asked the experts what factors are stopping European bio-based companies from becoming established.

A bio-based economy is driven by innovations, but innovations have to leave the lab and enter the market to make a difference. According to Stein, Europe has a very strong academic presence in bio-based technology. Unfortunately, this doesn’t easily transfer over to industry.

“The research is very well established. The industry is waiting for it but they only see a proof of concept and not a demonstration plant, for example,” Stein explained. “Research institutes don’t have a demonstration plant of 50,000 cubic meters of capacity … so why would [the industry] buy it? It becomes a ‘valley of death.’”

An example of the complex nature of bio-based technology entering industry is a group led by Thomas Leya at the Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology, Germany. Leya’s group studies cold-loving algae found in the Arctic. The researchers believe that these organisms could be useful sources of enzymes that work at cold temperatures, such as those required in the food industry.

In spite of the wide potential of algae as a bio-based source of products including food additives and cosmetics, Leya told me that the markets are generally conservative, with cosmetics being the easiest sector to break into.

“[The cosmetics industry] is more accessible for innovative approaches as this market is very trend-driven and is continuously looking for new ingredients,” Leya explained. “Of course, it also is a high-price market … It is easier to market small amounts of costly fine chemicals in the cosmetics sector than bulk chemicals at low prices in other sectors.”

European policymakers could do more to push bio-based technology from academia into the industry. “Increased public funding mechanisms and support with public-private partnerships for the bioeconomy will help to increase bio-innovation and its competitiveness,” Klaus Pellengahr, from the Danish enzyme producer Novozymes, told me.

The EU provides lots of funding for bio-based technology in the early stages, but European companies have trouble attracting private investors to commercialize the technology.

One of the reasons for this lack of interest from private investors is that the regulatory system is hard to navigate across the different member countries. This means that bio-based companies have an uphill struggle commercializing their technology.

“I find that some regulations, though valuable and sensible for protecting the consumer … need to be reformed so that they are easier to use,” Leya commented. “Feed additives from algae could improve meat and fish quality and survival of fish larvae in hatcheries, but cannot enter the market unless this specific algal species is listed in the novel food catalog. But getting it listed is extremely expensive and takes some years.”

Even if a company does attract private investment, VC firms have short-term goals, which can be problematic for establishing bio-based companies. “VCs are another problem because you have to have an exit strategy in your business. You grow it to sell it, which is not sustainable,” Stein explained.

These issues could be addressed if the government reforms the regulatory system and increases supportive funding programs for the nascent bio-based industry. “I’d love to see a lot more investing by not only the industry, because the industry always wants to make money, but more of a top-down approach by the government,” Stein commented.

While bio-based industries may provide a long-term value for society, they are usually more expensive than fossil fuel sources in the short term. Client companies wanting to maximize profits for their shareholders are unlikely to pay for bio-based goods for this reason.

“It still is less expensive to use traditional sources as these processes are established and have been used for a long time,” Leya told me. “As long as the traditional resources can still be bought at lower prices than products from alternative bio-based resources, the traditional, chemical, ones will be used.”

Another reason why the bio-based industry is expensive is because fossil fuel products are often priced artificially cheaply. Back in 2017, for example, fossil fuel companies worldwide received government subsidies totaling a whopping €4.6 trillion. In addition, many companies have been able to pump greenhouse gases into the environment without paying any tax on emissions. While the EU has implemented a trading scheme to incentivize reductions in emissions, it has had mixed results.

“If we incorporated a carbon dioxide tax in Europe or worldwide, for example, in an instant many products would double or triple their price. And then a bio-based economy would become much more efficient,” Stein commented.

Making the bioeconomy more appealing for the industry, therefore, requires a more level playing field in terms of subsidies, with prices that better represent the environmental cost of the materials. In addition, measures to better integrate bio-based methods into the economy could help bring down the costs.

Another obstacle to bio-based companies is limited public understanding about the bio-based industry. Well known figures such as the UK broadcaster David Attenborough have greatly improved our awareness of the need for change, but there is a lot more to teach the public about the bio-based industry.

“Of course, there is a will … of the consumer to use ‘green, sound, alternative’ products, but often they are not willing to pay the price or do not really understand which product really is environmentally green,” Leya said. “A product is not necessarily green just because that word is printed on the label.”

Another factor is public distrust of organisms modified by gene editing tools such as CRISPR/Cas9, whose many potential applications include improving the production of sustainable bio-based products such as biofuels. At present, EU regulators reflect this distrust by strictly regulating the commercialization of gene edited organisms, despite the fact that gene editing is more precise and direct than approved methods of modifying DNA, such as selective breeding.

“If you look at normal genetic modification such as breeding, it’s like firing a shotgun at your genetic material and seeing what comes out,” Stein explained. “If you look at CRISPR/Cas9, you take one gene and replace it — it’s like shooting like a sharpshooter. People don’t tend to know how it works and therefore a lot of education is needed.”

European biotech is definitely making leaps and bounds in developing technology to support a circular economy. For example, the French biotech Carbios is developing ways to turn old clothes into recycled plastic, and Afyren, another French biotech, converts plant waste into industrial chemicals.

Even with advances in biotechnology, the circular economy is still a long way off from becoming a reality. A lot of the challenges boil down to the idea that the cost of doing bio-based business is higher than business based on fossil fuels. Policymakers, therefore, will need to invest big public grants into kickstarting the circular economy.

An equally big responsibility falls on the consumers to demand more bio-based sources from companies and governments. “It is the market that will regulate the entry of algal biotechnology onto the everyday market,” Leya said. “That’s the good and the bad side of a free market.”

Achieving sustainability will also involve improving how efficient we are with resources in the first place. “I doubt that we can convert our complete industry into a green one, unless we start using fewer resources much more efficiently,” Leya added.

In terms of policy, there are encouraging movements in the right direction. Last year, the EU updated its official Bioeconomy Strategy to provide more support for bio-based companies. The circular economy has been one of the foci of the €80B Horizon 2020 project, which will finish next year.

Stein hopes that these movements will deliver practical results that will help bio-based companies to increase their foothold on the market. “My biggest hope would be that elements of a circular economy get incorporated into the real industry,” he concluded. “This means everything that comes with it: resource efficiency, sustainable energy. I’d love to see it. And I’m definitely working on it.”",European Union,2019.06

816,Tieto - Whitepaper reveals route to delivering a circular economy in asset finance,"The circular economy promises to be a global force for good that also creates a new international market worth trillions of dollars.

There is growing momentum for change, amid warnings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that the world must act immediately to avoid an environmental crisis.

For businesses, this means significant change in the coming years, as many countries move towards a zero-carbon economy, where there is less reliance on fossil fuels and a greater focus on sustainable ways of doing business.

A new whitepaper from leading IT services and software company Tieto provides a vision of the future as companies move away from the historic business model of ‘take-make-waste’ to a new circular economy, where the life of assets is extended through greater utilisation, reuse and recycling.

The whitepaper looks at the role of asset finance companies in the circular economy and features case studies of businesses that are introducing new business models to extend the life of assets and promote recycling and reuse of equipment and resources.
• What role can the circular economy play in asset finance?
• What are the benefits of a business model that supports the circular economy?
• How are asset finance companies adapting to greener ways of working?
• What are the next steps to ensure organisations can benefit from the potential of the circular economy? Per Dahlqvist, head of business development and analytics products, credit solutions and services at Tieto, said: “The asset finance industry can play a vital role in these new ways of doing business, through funding and by supporting the processes that enable change.” To read more about the future growth of the circular economy, download your copy of ‘Delivering a circular economy in asset finance’ by completing the form below.",United Kingdom,2019.06

825,"Nigeria’s 300,000 tonne e-waste gold mine drives a new circular economy","On May 09, the world celebrated the World Migratory Bird Day in order to raise awareness of migratory birds and the importance of international cooperation to conserve them. For the year 2020 the theme is “Birds Connect our World”. It is organized by a collaborative partnership among two United Nations treaties i.e. the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) and the African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbird Agreement (AEWA), and the Colorado based non-profit organization, Environment for the Americas (EFTA).

Migratory Birds play an important role by conserving and restoring the ecological connectivity and integrity of ecosystems that support the natural cycles that are essential for the survival and well-being of migratory birds. Over the years, migratory birds are facing severe existential threat. Factors like loss of habitat, climate change, poisoning, power lines, and illegal killing have contributed immensely to the threat. It is realized that individual State effort wouldn’t bring desired results, however, sincere collective actions from all nation-states, across the world, has the potential to better protect migratory birds and the habitats they need to survive and thrive.

In this regard, CMS brings together the nation-states through which migratory animals pass, the Range States, and lays the legal foundation for internationally coordinated conservation measures throughout a migratory range. Migratory species threatened with extinction are listed on Appendix-Iand those migratory species that need or would significantly benefit from international co-operation are listed in Appendix-II of the Convention. Listing generally leads to concerted actions in different national jurisdictions in which a species range. Actions may include cooperation among range countries, harmonization in policies etc. through regional agreements. CMS has working groups specializing in various fauna families, and a scientific council that advises research-based solutions for conservation.

At least 1,317 bird species have been recorded in India against around 10,000 species found worldwide. Of the 1,317 species recorded in India, 72 are endemic to the country. According to an assessment of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) 2018, a total of 100 species of Indian birds are classified as ‘threatened’. Of these, 17 are categorized as ‘critically endangered’, 20 as ‘endangered’, and 63 as ‘vulnerable’.Besides these threatened species, there are several other species that are marked by sparse population size and restricted range and are generally considered rare by conservationists.

The conservation of wildlife and habitats has long been part of the cultural ethos of India.In February 2020the 13thsession of the Conference of the Partiesto the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals(COP-13) was held in Gandhinagar, India. The COP-13 had the theme titled “Migratory species connect the planet and together we welcome them home”. The COP-13resulted in the adoption of seven new species including migratory birds like Great Indian Bustard, Bengal Florican, Little Bustard, Antipodean Albatross to Appendix-I of the CMS. In this regard, the Government of India also issued a special stamp edition featuring the Great Indian Bustard as the mascot of COP-13.

COP-13 was the largest ever in the history of the Convention, with 2,550 people attending including 263 delegates representing 82 Parties, 11 delegates from 5 non-Party countries, 50 representatives from United Nations agencies, 70 representatives of international NGOs, 127 representatives of national NGOs and over 100 members of both national and international media.COP13 adopted the Gandhinagar Declaration, which calls for integration of migratory species and the concept of ‘ecological connectivity’ in the new framework (to be adopted at the United Nations Biodiversity Conference in October).Interestingly, COP-13 is perhaps the first COP ever inaugurated by the Head of Government of the host-country.

Convention on Migratory Species and its Agreements and MoUs

The CMS was initially signed by 21 nation-states in Bonn, Germany on 1979 and came into force in November, 1983. Presently, CMS has 130 nation-states as its Party while several other nation-states, although not Party to the CMS are Party to one or more of the agreements and/or have signed one or more of the Memorandum of Understandings (MoUs). The CMS was mainly drafted by Francoise Burhenne-Guilmin who later became head of IUCN’s Environmental Law Commission. CMS is species specific and covers terrestrial, marine and avian migratory species. According to Philippe Sands and Jacqueline Peel migratory species can be classified into four general categories; (1) Marine species which breed on the shores of coastal states but migrate to sea during adult life, e.g. seals, sea turtles, anadromous fish; (2) Highly migratory marine species which travel between exclusive economic zones and high seas e.g. tuna or whales; (3) Territorial species with a well-established migration pattern e.g. birds; and (4) Territorial or marine species which live in border areas and regularly cross jurisdiction boundaries e.g. gorillas or elephants.

Interestingly, however, the CMS itself does not apply any direct measures, but directs the “range states” to make ancillary agreements. So far six regional agreements and seven non-binding MoUs have been convened on various migratory species, like AEWA, 1995whichis an intergovernmental treaty dedicated to the conservation of migratory water birds including 255 species of birds ecologically dependent on wetlands for at least part of their annual cycle and their habitats across Africa, Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, Greenland and the Canadian Archipelago. Likewise, the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP), 2001 was made to recognize the need for international cooperation for marine migratory species like Albatrosses and Petrels.

Similarly, the MoU concerning conservation measures for the Siberian Crane, 1993 was entered to protect Siberian Cranes. The MoU concerning conservation measures for the Slender-Billed Curlew, 1994 was formed with an aim to safeguard the Slender-Billed Curlew. The MoU on the conservation and management of the Great Bustard, 2001 was also made to correct the continuous decline of the Great Bustard and degradation or fragmentation of suitable habitats and hunting pressure in Middle-European States etc.

Prior to the multilateral international conventions, migratory bird treaties (MBTs) were main instruments for bird protection. The United States of America(USA) is pioneer in entering into the treaty regime of ‘nation-state conservation policy’. Perhaps, the thought was to successfully strengthen the domestic laws and thereafter facilitate the international cooperation for avian conservation. The 1916,The United States signs a treaty with Great Britain (acting on behalf of Canada, then part of the British Empire)to stop all hunting of insectivorous birds and to establish specific hunting seasons for game birds. In order to implement the treaty, the USA Congress passed the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, 1918 and replaced the Weeks-McLean Act, 1913.The said treaty is known to be one of the oldest sources of international environmental law.Later, USA signed a treaty similar to the one entered between Great Britain with Mexico in 1936 for the protection (through laws and regulations) of migratory birds in their movements across the two signatory nation-states.USA signed treaty with Japan in 1972 for protection of migratory birds except if an open season has been established. Likewise, USA entered treaty with Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1976 to improve cooperation between the contracting parties as the conservation of migratory birds passing between their territories.

The success of MBTs to facilitate, encourage, and justify expensive and often low-priority bird conservation and research facilities rubbed onto other nation-states. For instance, Japan in 1973 signed a treaty with USSR to promote cooperation in the conservation of birds migrating between the contracting parties’ territories and of endangered species of birds. In 1974, Australia signed an identical treaty (the one entered between Japan and USSR) with Japan. In 1981, Japan entered an agreement with Peoples Republic of China (PRC) for the prohibition of the taking of birds listed in an appendix to the treaty, establishment of bird sanctuaries, and for the exchange of research results. This bilateral migratory bird agreement has been instrumental in building research capacity in PRC for the study of migratory birds.

There are certain little known yet significant MBTs, for example, the 1984 agreement between India and USSR, which is applicable to species of birds for which there is a positive evidence of migration between the two countries and also to species or sub-species common to both countries and listed in the appendix attached with the agreement. Both nations agreed to promote joint research programs and establish bird sanctuaries and endeavour to preserve and improve the natural environment of migratory birds. Another, treaty entered between Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation in 1994 (is the only bilateral treaty entered in 1990s)was on mutual cooperation for taking measures for the management and protection of migratory birds and their habitat and the prevention of the extinction of certain birds. It recognized that many species of birds migrate between and seasonally live in both countries and that certain species of birds are in danger of extinction.

Though, the merits of MBTs are mostly limited to migratory bird species and is limited between the nation-states party to such treaties. Nevertheless, from the perusal of above-discussed MBTs, it is argued that MBTs are still a beneficial tool since multinational treaties tend to be inflexible, cumbersome, and politically driven. They act as a useful tool for international wildlife conservation (even after the emergence of multinational treaties like CMS). At the same time, it would be much too simplistic to conclude that any one category or model of MBT is better than any other, In fact MBTs have starting to form a network of international conservation efforts.

The last flocks of passenger pigeons were reported in 1888, the last confirmed sighting occurred in 1900, and the last passenger pigeon died in captivity in 1914 in Cincinnati zoo.In 1850 Alexander Wilson, an ornithol­ogist,watched migrating flock of passenger pigeons and wrote that their passing had darkened the sky for more than 30 minutes(containing 2 billion birds spread over 384 km long and 1.6 km wide, in the sky). Both passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius) and Dodo (Raphus cucullatus) were most dramatic bird extinction ever recorded. Both were the victim of human consumption. Even thereafter, the human desire did not stop, birds which were frequently around 10 years ago, have become rare and in certain cases extinct. In the times, when most of the world’s population is under some form of restricted movement due to the COVID-19, this theme “Birds Connect Our World” carries a particular relevance and poignance. The need of hour is multiple efforts, for instance, during recently concluded COP-13, the Indian Prime Minister pledged to focus on the conservation of migratory birds along the Central Asian Flyway, announced the establishment of an institutional research facility for the conservation of migratory birds and marine turtles, and confirmed efforts to reduce pollution from micro-plastic and single-use plastic etc. It is desired that human-beings collectively act to prevent the destruction of birds. This would demand adherence of stringent domestic laws, and measures that conserve and protect their habitats and their flyways.

831,Wasting waste and wasting an opportunity,"The optics of it certainly look extraordinary: Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, aged 16, sat down with the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in February to discuss climate action. Two months later, in April, she was given the floor of the European Parliament to warn and lecture members about the imminent climatic. European leaders look considerate in the pictures, almost fatherly figures empathetically listening to a concerned offspring. It was a great photographic opportunity, mainly for the leaders. Advice was heeded, all boxes were ticked. But what is really happening with waste management, a key axis of the bloc’s environmental policy, in the members states?

One has to look no further than south eastern European nations to identify the laggards. When it comes to waste management, the European Commission has set out on an ambitious yet much-needed plan, setting the target at 50% for municipal waste recycling by 2020. As the latest edition of the country-specific Environmental Implementation Review reports -the main monitoring tool at the disposal of the European Commission- published on 5 April show, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Malta, and Romania are far from achieving this goal. Compared to a 46% EU-28-wide average, Bulgaria was only recycling 35% of the municipal waste it produces, Greece’s rate stood at 19%, Cyprus utilised only 16% of that, Romania 14%, and Malta an alarmingly-low 6%.

More than that, it is startling to see that municipal waste not only is not recycled, but it ends up in -dangerous for public health- landfill sites: according to the same report, 62% of municipal waste was disposed in such sites in Bulgaria, 70% in Romania (the figure does not include temporary storage before disposal that would further inflate that number), 76% in Cyprus, 80% in Greece and a shocking total of 86% in Malta, compared to a European Union average of 24%. It is indicative that Malta’s rate is three and a half times the European average.

Unfortunately, and connected to the above situation, it does get worse: those countries fare very badly when it comes to circular (meaning secondary) use of waste. Whereas the EU average stood at 11.7% in 2016, the year the latest figures come from, Malta only achieved a score of 5.2 % for secondary use of waste, Bulgaria 4.3%, Cyprus 2.3%, Greece 2% and Romania 1.5%.

The problem seems to be structural: the mentality of treating waste as a resource does not appear to have caught up with the environmental agencies and officials with executive powers in the field in those countries. Their national strategies, such as that of Cyprus, for example, are mostly outdated, failing to incorporate the principles of circular economy.

Beyond that, and not coincidentally, the absorption rate of EU funds dedicated to the modernisation to the new standards of waste management facilities and the implementation of the circular economy agenda is extremely low in the very same countries. The case of Romania, where the low absorption rate has led to a redirection of funds to other actions -funds that are highly unlikely to be repatriated- is characteristic. Out of almost €64 billion of EU structural funds (up to €88 if one counts national co-financing) singled out for environmental protection and resource efficiency programmes in the 2014-2020 budgetary cycle, significant chunks are dedicated to waste management (€5.5 billion) and water treatment (another €15 billion). However, overall absorption rates are discouraging. In the first five years of the seven-years-long financial framework (until 31 December 2018), 28% of the total amount available under the Environment Protection & Resource Efficiency budgetary category was spent in Malta, out of the 84% allocated to specific programmes, with the rest of 16% yet to be assigned to specific programmes with two years to go until the end of the cycle. In Cyprus, 25% was spent out of 44% of the funds allocated to specific programmes, with 56% yet to be assigned, in Greece 23% out of 60%, in Romania 20% out of 71% and in Bulgaria 18% out of 52%.

What does that tell us? That those countries completely lack a vision and a strategy. Naysayers might want to say that, for whatever reason, they also lack willingness. As a say goes, it is easy for those who are at the bottom of the performance pyramid to move up: they only have to copy what those who perform better do. It seems that they are not. It is not simply the absorption rate, which might extend to other areas as well: even if those countries had been attracting more funds, the direction would have been wrong, given most national strategies are outdated, failing to incorporate circular economy principles.

And here comes the question that begs for an answer: what is the European Commission, the guardian of all things environmental in the Union, doing? There is the early warning reporting, issued to countries that risk to miss targets. The latest set of reports was published on 24 September 2018. Then, when it comes to waste management and the operation of landfills, there are ongoing proceedings at different stages, including referral of infringement cases to the European Court of Justice, especially for countries like Greece, Bulgaria and Romania (along Spain, Slovenia, Slovakia and Italy, for example).

But what about the rest? And what about the overall strategy, not specific incidents or isolated aspects that most infringement cases focus on? Does the European Commission have to wait until 2020, the benchmark year for municipal waste recycling, to confirm the failure of those states to comply? To make the transition from rhetoric to action, Berlaymont will have to act quickly and decisively.

Otherwise, waste is going to waste. And so is our planet.",European Union,2019.06
832,Calls for clean power and cheese-waste-powered heat: The sustainability success stories of the week,"Calls for clean power and cheese-waste-powered heat: The sustainability success stories of the week

As part of our Mission Possible campaign, edie brings you this weekly round-up of five of the best sustainability success stories of the week from across the globe.

Published every week, the new series charts how businesses and sustainability professionals are working to achieve their 'Mission Possible' across the campaign's five key pillars - energy, resources, infrastructure, mobility and business leadership.

From the launch of a network of electric vehicle charging points in North London, to a coalition of Japanese corporates lobbying their national government over renewable energy, each of these projects and initiatives is empowering businesses to play their part in achieving a sustainable future, today.

Regular readers of edie will be well aware of the negative carbon impact of food waste, and that the scale of the world’s food waste mountain is only set to grow without ambitious actions from all areas of society. But this waste is also a missed business opportunity, with around $1trn believed to be lost to the global economy due to a linear economy for foodstuffs every year – equivalent to 1.5% of the world’s GDP.

In order to recapture some of this value, Yorkshire-based dairy The Wensleydale Creamery has partnered with the Leeming biogas plant to turn waste whey from its cheese factory into low-carbon heat. The deal will see the whey sent for anaerobic digestion, with the resulting gas injected directly into the local gas grid or used as fertiliser. Overall, the waste is expected to produce enough renewable gas to heat 4,000 local homes.

The move comes amid a backdrop of calls for faster action on decarbonising heat, in line with the UK Government’s new net-zero carbon target for 2050.

“The whole process of converting local milk to premium cheese and then deriving environmental and economic benefit from the natural by-products is an essential part of our business plan as a proud rural business,” The Wensleydale Creamery’s managing director David Hartley said.

It’s been a busy week for resource efficiency announcements, which is why we’ve chosen to feature an array of progress here.

Tuesday (18 June) saw Coca-Cola GB announce the launch of its first 100% recycled and recyclable bottles, which will be used to house its 600ml and 850ml Glaceau Smartwater lines by September. The company also confirmed plans to replace the green plastic in its Sprite bottles with a clear alternative, in order to boost recyclability. Since then, the Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling company has completed a switch to 100% recycled PET (rPET) for its Vasler water bottles, following the success of the same move for its Deep RiverRock and Romerquelle brands.

Later on in the week, both 3M and Google unveiled major new circular economy commitments. The former has joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s CE100 initiative while the latter has introduced a new goal to “maximise the reuse of finite resources across [it’s] operations, products and supply chains and enable others to do the same”.

“The challenges to making this vision a reality are as daunting as they are exciting. It demands that we redefine how systems work—from what we value and the choices we make, to the assumptions and industrial processes that have been standard practice across our economy for decades,” Google’s chief sustainability officer Kate Brandt said in a blog post.

As the electric vehicle (EV) revolution continues to gather pace, research has continued to suggest that the UK’s electric transport ambitions could be held back by a lack of suitable charging infrastructure. And a separate study has found that budget cuts are leaving most local authorities across the UK in a poor position to scale up their EV charging networks and bolster their power systems to support this.

However, this trend can’t be seen in Barnet, north London, where the council has just completed the installation of 40 lamp post charging points powered entirely using clean energy. Developed by charging technology firm CityEV, the chargers cost 25p per hour to use and take around eight hours to fully charge most fully electric passenger car models. In order to incentivise residents to use the chargers, Barnet Council has plotted their locations onto a digital map, available online, and has moved to enable payment by contactless card and smartphone.

Looking to the future, the local authority is looking to install a further 40 lamp post chargers across the borough by the end of the year, along with 30 stand-alone charging points in car parks.

“We expect the popularity of fully electric and hybrid cars to grow and grow in the coming years as they are cheaper, cleaner and greener than conventional cars, and an increasingly convenient way of getting from A to B,” Barnet Council’s environment committee chair Dean Cohen said. “We are happy to support their development, improving air quality in our borough and giving our residents more options for getting about in an eco-friendly way.”

World’s first mile-high skyscraper 'will be wooden', experts claim

Given that the UN estimates that around 2.5 billion more people will be living in cities by 2050 the onus is now on firms within the built environment sector to create scalable and sustainable solutions for urban living.

And, given that the world’s first mile-high skyscraper is predicted to be built by 2050, as population density increases, these solutions will need to be applicable to tall and ultra-tall buildings. In an interview with Metro this week, renowned futurologist Ed Gillespie and key figures from the architecture space argued that the tall buildings of the future are likely to be wooden and even carbon negative.They cited recent research from the University of Cambridge proving that timber buildings of up to 300m in height would last just as long as their steel and concrete counterparts, without the expense or carbon intensity.

The tallest timber building in the world currently is Norway’s 85m-tall, 18-storey Mjostarnet. However London’s Oakwood Tower at Barbican, which is currently under development, will be 300m high and plans have also been submitted to build a 70-stored, 350m timber tower in 2041.

Japanese business giants all for more ambitious national clean energy targets

Businesses obtained 13.4GW of clean energy through power purchase agreements (PPAs) in 2018, more than doubling the record set in the previous year. But the vast majority of this energy (8.5GW) was sold to corporates in America, with nations across Asia, Africa and Oceania repeatedly citing difficulties in obtaining clean power due to a lack of infrastructure and policy support.

This week saw a coalition of 20 of the largest firms in Japan, including the likes of Sony, Fujitsu and Apple Japan, call on their national government to do more to support their clean power transition. Specifically, they urged policymakers to require renewables to account for 50% of Japan’s national electricity mix by 2030 and to implement measures to ensure that long-term PPAs are easier to access and involve guaranteed pricing. Another key ask is for the government to undertake an in-depth assessment of the wider benefits of switching to renewable energy and share the results publicly.

The call to action was convened by The Climate Group, whose RE100 campaign manager Constant Alarcon said: “These companies realize that in order to remain competitive in a globalized economy, they must embrace a low carbon future. By working hand-in-hand with the government, Japanese companies can drive greater demand for renewables and deliver the clean economy of tomorrow.”",Ireland,2019.06
835,Nigeria’s e-waste gold mine to drive circular economy,"The Nigerian government, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and UN Environment today (21 June) launched a new $15 million initiative to turn the tide on e-waste in Nigeria.

A global model for a circular electronics system, the project was announced at the Forum’s Annual Meeting 2019 and will kickstart a sustainable electronics economy in Nigeria, protecting the environment while creating safe employment for thousands of people.

The initiative aims to transform Nigeria’s current “informal and hazardous” recycling into a formally legislated system that benefits all actors by including a small fee on the sale of electronics to subsidise formal recycling.

Speaking at the launch of the programme, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of the Environment, Ibukun Odusote, said e-waste posed a grave danger to both the environment and human health in Nigeria.

“This intervention by Global Environment Facility aims to stimulate the development of a sustainable circular economy for electronic products in Nigeria.”

She said the project would also support the E-waste Producers Responsibility Organisation – a key initiative of the Government of Nigeria to promote sustainable production and consumption by encouraging producers to take responsibility for the entire life cycle of their products.

With 100 times more gold in a tonne of e-waste than in a tonne of gold ore, alongside other scarce and valuable materials such as platinum, cobalt and rare earth elements, a safe and efficient recycling industry has huge economic potential, it says.

According to the International Labour Organisation, up to 100,000 people work in the informal e-waste recycling sector in Nigeria, and over half a million tonnes of discarded appliances are processed in the country every year.

Yet waste that is considered to have no economic value is often dumped or burned – releasing pollutants like heavy metals and toxic chemicals into the air, water and soil.

The initiative aims to develop systems for the disposal of non-usable and toxic waste, aiming to collect, treat and dispose of more than 270 tonnes of e-waste contaminated with persistent organic pollutants and 30 tonnes of waste containing mercury.

The project also aims to have an impact beyond Nigeria through the development of a practical circular electronics model for Africa and beyond, by sharing best practices, promoting regional and global dialogue, and engaging global manufacturers.

Dominic Waughray, managing director and head of the Centre for Global Public Goods at the Forum said: “This project demonstrates how the circular economy can spur economic growth, create jobs and benefit the environment.”

“The environmental and economic benefits of a circular economy are clear,” said Inger Andersen, UN Environment executive director.

“This innovative partnership with the Government of Nigeria and the Global Environment Facility is a positive step in the country’s efforts to kickstart a circular electronics system, and one that UN Environment is proud to support.”

The initiative sits within the Circular Economy Approaches for the Electronics Sector in Nigeria project and will be implemented by the National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency.

The $15 million scheme brings together players from government, the private sector and civil society.

It is part of the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE) built by the World Economic Forum, and sees cooperation with recyclers and electronics manufactures Dell, HP, Microsoft and Phillips.

PACE is looking for opportunities to scale and replicate the system in partnership with more companies and in other countries.",United Kingdom,2019.06
849,Climate Plan: Circular Economy a welcome feature,"The inclusion of a circular economy module in the Government’s new Climate Action Plan is a “welcome change” according to experts.

A circular economy aims to reduce waste at all stages of the production cycle and ensure materials are used as efficiently as possible for a reduced carbon output.

Targets in the plan include developing a circular economy action plan and supporting eco-design for Irish companies, as well as aligning with the EU Circular Economy Package finalised in March 2019.

Environmental groups have been calling for a transition from a linear economy to a circular economy for some time.

Cillian Lohan, CEO of the Green Economy Foundation said “it’s great” that that Government are recognising circular economy as “a tool for climate action”.

Mr Lohan said, however, it was “disappointing” that the plan appears to make circular economy and waste “synonymous”.

He said that goal 135 in the plan, developing the circular economy action plan, would be “crucial” as to how we move forward as a country.

“It needs to be a move from a linear to circular economic model,” he said.

CEO of the Rediscovery Centre, Dr Sarah Miller said that governance and oversight of the plan will be “essential” to turn it from a “plan into action”.

With regards the proposed circular economy action plan, Dr Miller said that it is “long overdue”, adding that it should be “prioritised and fast-tracked”.

Public consultation on the action plan is due to begin in the third quarter of 2019 in advance of publication in the second quarter of 2020.

“If we’re going to transition, we need a plan that doesn’t just focus on waste. It’s about managing how we live, the consumption, production and distribution of products as well,” Ms Miller added.

“It’s important to remember that 40 per cent of carbon associated with products comes from their production and less than 2 per cent comes from the waste management,” she said.

Simon O’Rafferty, strategy designer and author of the study ‘Moving Ireland towards the Circular Economy’, said the public consultation process moving forward should be “deliberative and co-creative”.

He also believes that Ireland needs to support the emergence of innovative start-ups that are “enabling circular business models and future jobs”.

“Ireland has some possible advantages in the digital and tech sectors which can drive the underlying services and data infrastructures for a circular economy,” he said.

“We are not yet capturing the true potential of a circular sharing economy, digital manufacturing methods, artificial intelligence and block-chain, digital services and social innovation,” he added.

Mr O’Rafferty also maintained that Ireland needs to look at its physical infrastructure.

“We need to consider reintroducing reprocessing infrastructure in Ireland. We already have one of Europe’s largest PET drink bottles reprocessing companies in Ireland providing decent jobs, so we need to start developing further,” he said.",United Kingdom,2019.06
850,Google's new circular economy strategy to 'maximise reuse' across its operations,"Google's new circular economy strategy to 'maximise reuse' across its operations

Tech giant Google has launched a new circular economy initiative aimed at addressing an ""inherently unsustainable"" demand for resources and products by leveraging the transformational potential of technology.

Announced earlier this week, the Circular Google initiative introduced a new goal to “maximise the reuse of finite resources across [it’s] operations, products and supply chains and enable others to do the same”.

While lacking tangible and time-based goal for the overall ambition, the new strategy has set numerous sub-goals across the tech company’s key operations, products and services.

For offices and staff, Google aims to reduce single-use beverage use per seated head count (SHC) at its top 25 office sites by 35% by 2019, rising to 50% by 2020.

By focusing on designing out waste and pollution, Google will develop supply chain contracts to prioritise and accept secondary use materials by 2020 and build 100% of consumer electronic products launching from 2022 onwards to maximise recycled content use where possible.

“The challenges to making this vision a reality are as daunting as they are exciting. It demands that we redefine how systems work—from what we value and the choices we make, to the assumptions and industrial processes that have been standard practice across our economy for decades,” Google’s chief sustainability officer Kate Brandt said in a blog post.

“Our new circular Google strategy is part of our wider effort to build sustainability into everything we do.”

Google, powered by 100% renewable energy across its global facilities, defines ‘maximise reuse’ as the “implementation, to the fullest extent possible, of circular principles”, including both products and systems.

A key focus of the strategy is that of the built environment. “Zero-waste data centres” will be targeted and as of 2017, 18% of Google’s newly deployed servers were remanufactured machines, and 11% of the components used for machine upgrades were refurbished. Rather than contributing to waste, equipment that can’t be used will be resold. In 2017, Google resold more than 2.1 million units into the secondary market for reuse by other organisations. Zero-waste to landfill from data centres is an existing commitment, with 91% currently diverted from landfill.

Landfill diversion from offices currently sits at 78% and Google is focusing on construction and deconstruction to contribute to its circular vision. Google has been implementing interior ‘salvage and reuse’ at the interior building scale since 2012. Last year, the company started work with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to explore the triple bottom line benefits of deconstruction.

Other targets of the new initiative include evaluating regenerative strategies for 100% of Bay Area district infrastructure (including energy, water, and waste) and reducing food and inorganic waste.

At a global scale, it has been estimated that transitioning to a circular economy could generate $4.5trn in new economic output by 2030. As such, Google is leveraging its own technological expertise to help other sectors transition to closed-loop economies. Google has partnered with fashion brand Stella McCartney on the first phase of a new machine learning data analytics tool to improve the transparency of the supply chains for the fashion industry, for example.",Ireland,2019.06

853,ISO technical committee for circular economy formed,"It’s a well-known fact that the rise in consumerism and disposable products is choking our planet and exhausting it at the same time. Before we reach the day where there is more plastic in the sea than fish1, something has to be done to ebb the flow. According to the World Economic Forum, moving towards a circular economy is the key, and a ‘trillion-dollar opportunity, with huge potential for innovation, job creation and economic growth’.

A circular economy is one where it is restorative or regenerative. Instead of buy, use, throw, the idea is that nothing, or little is ‘thrown’, rather it reused, or regenerated, thus reducing waste as well as the use of our resources.

While many organizations ‘do their bit’ in terms of recycling or sourcing locally, we are far from a world where the economy is truly circular, said the chair of ISO’s new committee on the circular economy, Catherine Chevauche. “In order to have a new economic model, businesses need a new business model – what has been lacking is a truly global vision of what a circular economy really is and a model that any organization can adopt.”

A new ISO technical committee intends to address this. ISO/TC 323, Circular economy, is currently made up of experts from over 65 different countries and growing.

 The idea for the committee began with a seminar held by AFNOR, ISO’s member for France, where business leaders from many sectors expressed the need to move from a linear to a circular economy model. What followed was a French standard, XP X30-901, Circular economy – Circular economy project management system – Requirements and guidelines that was published in 2018. The response was so positive that an international committee was proposed and ISO/TC 323 was born.

The committee intends to produce a set of internationally agreed principles, terminology, a framework of what a circular economy is, and develop a management system standard. It also will work on alternative business models and method for measuring and assessing circularity.

Catherine said there is a recognized urgency to move towards a circular economy, due to the effects of resource and biodiversity depletion, climate change and the growing inequalities across countries related to the world’s production and consumption patterns. “The members of the committee agree that there is a need to act now to develop standards in this area as quickly as possible,” she said. “This is particularly true in developing countries, who have tended to bear the brunt of inequalities of wealth and waste in the developed world.”

ISO/TC 323, Circular economy, aims to cover all aspects of a circular economy including public procurement, production and distribution, end of life as well as wider areas such as behavioural change in society, and assessment, such as some kind of circularity footprint or index. It will also benefit from liaising with the many other ISO technical committees dedicated to standards that are related, such as those for sustainable procurement, quality and environmental management and more.

855,Circular economy pushes carbon-neutral laptops across Europe,"Over 160 million new laptops are made every year and 160,000 disposed of daily in the EU alone. This results in tons of e-waste, the largest growing waste stream, and contributes significantly to carbon emissions and climate change. A circular economy approach directly addresses this issue – over 70% of discarded laptops could be reused.

This is what Circular Computing does, taking thousands of ex-lease computers from large corporations every month. These go through a rigorous 5-hour re-manufacturing process during which they are dismantled, cleaned, repaired, upgraded and refinished in a state of the art, purpose-built re-manufacturing facility. The company has invested over €5 million in a purpose-built computer re-manufacturing facility, which it expects can extend the life of laptops by another 3 to 4 years.

860,Intelligent materials for Artificial photosynthesis: Towards a Circular Economy | IMDEA Energy,"One of the most important and elusive challenges that Science faces today is the development of technologies capable of alleviating the effect of greenhouse gases (GHGs) as main actors of global warming. To face this challenge, FotoArt-CM proposes the development of a new technology called artificial photosynthesis based on sustainable energy sources, which allows to reduce and recover those emissions and leads to the valorization of abundant feedstocks (Co2,H2, N2 and biomass) to obtain products useful products for society such as fuels, drugs, plastics, fertilizers, etc…

FotoArt-CM Program, which is funded for the next 4 years by the Regional Government of Madrid, is composed of 6 research groups together with 4 laboratories from REDLAB network of the Regional Government of Madrid (82 researchers) with a vast scientific experience in the fields of materials science, nanotechnology and their application to processes. Their main goal is to develop new generation of multifunctional materials and devices to make an efficient use of renewable energy, mainly solar, to obtain fuels and chemical through artificial photosynthesis.

This Program aims to be a reference to improve the knowledge of artificial photosynthesis processes, laying the foundation of future strategies to reduce GHGs effects and society dependence on fossil fuels.

875,Materials Science Forum Vol. 959 | Scientific.Net,"Copper Availability from the Recycling of Electric Vehicles in Europe, North America and China: A Model Based Estimation until 2050 Abstract: The expected increase in electric mobility is accompanied by an additional demand for copper, which is needed for the electric drivetrain consisting of the electric motor and auxiliary components. Key of the presented work is a simulation model to assess the implications of this additional copper demand on stocks and scrap flows of copper in the EU28, North America and China until the year 2050. The calculation results indicate that in the mid 2030s the copper used for electric vehicles starts having a considerable influence on both stocks and scrap flows. With 3 million tonnes of additional copper scrap in 2050, scrap from electric vehicles accounts for ~17% of China's total copper scrap. In absolute terms, this scrap flow is five times higher than the corresponding flows in Europe and North America. Therefore, China seems to be particularly promising as a location for recyclers and (secondary) copper smelters to expand their businesses.

Potential Contribution of Secondary Materials to Overall Supply - The Example of the European Cobalt Cycle Abstract: Higher efficiency in raw material recycling is discussed as a key strategy to decrease the environmental impact of resource consumption and to improve materials’ availability in order to mitigate supply risks. However, particularly in the case of technology metals, demand is driven by specific emerging technologies from which recycling will not be possible before the end of their useful lifetimes. Hence, the availability of secondary materials is limited by the amount of obsolete products as well as their collection, separation and treatment during waste management and recycling. In this paper, we present the results of a dynamic material flow model for cobalt as a key raw material for lithium-ion batteries at an European level (EU28). This model aims at quantifying the current state of recycling and future recycling potentials from end-of-life (EoL) product flows. While it is expectable that obsolete large battery packs from (hybrid) electric vehicles will be efficiently collected in future, EoL Li-ion battery flows will remain dominated by smaller electronic equipment (smartphones, laptops etc.) in the coming years and the model results show a significant potential for improvements in collection and material recovery from EoL batteries in Europe. A major challenge will be the collection of smaller batteries and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) in general from which a significant share of total European cobalt demand could be recovered in the coming years.

Predictive and Flexible Circular Economy Approaches for Highly Integrated Products and their Materials as Given in E-Mobility and ICT Abstract: The control of degraded products, waste streams and secondary raw materials that can be produced from those must be in line with demand within the framework of an Advanced Circular Economy. Material requirements are developing dynamically depending on product development and consumer behavior. Accordingly, the recycling system must also behave dynamically and predictively and has to be transformed into stable, efficient but flexible process routes. This can also lead to a shift in the significance and sequence of the respective materials of main and secondary value in a process chain. This paper presents a novel approach for a smart and predictive circular economy. The approach consists of three major parts: An open information marketplace to meet information needs, suitable economic assessment and planning methods, and a dynamic optimization of the recycling process chain, e.g., selection of process steps and their sequence.

Allocation Procedures for Generic Cascade Use Cases - An Evaluation Using Monte Carlo Analysis Abstract: Cascade use - a concept for increasing resource efficiency by multiple use of resources - gains in importance, in particular for bio-based materials. Allocation of environmental burdens and costs along the cascade chain plays a major role in deciding whether to establish a cascade or not. This highlights the need for a methodology for properly assessing different types of cascades. To provide guidance in terms of choice of allocation procedure available from life cycle assessment (LCA), Monte Carlo analysis is used. Especially hybrid, individually tailored allocation approaches can be evaluated in this way. The results show a high diversity of possible outcomes in terms of general allocation intensity (how much burden is shifted between steps of the cascade), rank reversals (exchange of positions inside the burden ranking) and variance of the overall results of the cascade allocation. Results are valuable for selecting an allocation procedure for cascade LCA and for further interpreting cascade models using specific allocation procedures.

Recycling of Lithium Iron Phosphate Batteries: Future Prospects and Research Needs Abstract: Since the first synthesis of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) as active cathode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIB) in 1996, it has gained a considerable market share and further growth is expected. Main applications are the fast-growing sectors electromobility and to a lesser extend stationary energy storage. Despite increasing return flows, so far, little emphasis has been put on the recycling of LFP batteries due to the low content of high-value metals. In this study, current developments in the LFP battery market are presented. Furthermore, recycling processes for LIBs are reviewed and their applicability for LFP batteries is assessed. Currently, China is the main market for LFP batteries and rapidly increasing return flows are observed. In Europe and the USA, other battery chemistries are predominant. For LFP battery recycling, individually adaptable processes based on mechanical treatment of the cells followed by hydrometallurgical processing of the active cathode material seem to be the most promising approach. However, at present, these processes are only available at pilot scale, the profitability and their environmental performance are questionable. Therefore, further research addressing these challenges is urgently needed.

Integrated Direct Carbonation Process for Lithium Recovery from Primary and Secondary Resources Abstract: In view of the increasing demand for lithium and the unequal distribution of lithium deposits worldwide, local deposits such as the zinnwaldite deposit at Zinnwald/Cínovec are increasingly coming into focus. It could be shown that especially the direct carbonation process with supercritical CO represents a promising approach for a technical implementation due to the low chemical consumption as well as the high selectivity for lithium. Moreover, besides primary ore (zinnwaldite), the method is also suitable for recovering lithium carbonate from black mass, the lithium-containing fraction from lithium ion battery recycling.

Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are crucial for non-emission technologies, like electric vehicles and renewable energy sources. The growing battery market causes supply risks for affected raw materials like cobalt, nickel, natural graphite and, in the future, lithium. On the other hand, the number of end-of-life Li-ion batteries grows significantly and provides an additional source for these critical materials via recycling. In electrohydraulic fragmentation (EHF), Li-ion battery cells are disintegrated at component interfaces, thus separating those components. Battery materials like cathode active material, graphite, electrode foils and housing parts can be extracted for producing new batteries or for further refining in hydrometallurgical processing. Compared to state-of-the-art pyrometallurgical recycling, the EHF is more energy and cost efficient due to the easy processing to a valuable battery material product.

Liquid-Liquid Extraction and Chromatography Process Routes for the Purification of Lithium Abstract: Since several years, the lithium market is characterized by high growth rates especially due to the increasing demand for lithium-ion batteries. Therefore, the primary production is currently expanded and there is a growing interest in recycling. However, because of the chemical properties of lithium, many production processes lack efficient processes for the separation, concentration and purification of lithium. This article reviews the current use of liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and chromatography in lithium production as well as research. Currently, the industrial application of LLE and chromatography in lithium purification is limited to the extraction of impurities and co-products. Extraction of lithium is only used as concentration step in few processes before lithium precipitation. In research and development, a wide variety of extractants and resins is investigated. In LLE, chelating extractants like crown ethers and calixarene and synergistic systems show the greatest potential. In the chromatographic separation the main focus of research lies upon cation exchange media, especially media with sulfonated ligands. However, most research is still in early development. Therefore, extensive research is needed to enable the industrial use of optimized LLE and chromatography processes in lithium production.

Abstract: Printed circuit boards are currently coated with Br-containing epoxy resins. With respect to recycling of the material removal of the halogen is important. Moreover, it appears important to test whether recycling of the coating is feasible. The resin from circuit board reference material was extracted with extraction media containing supercritical carbon dioxide. It is shown that ternary mixtures containing 2-propanol and water allow for the complete removal of the coating. In contrast to the original material the degraded coating is soluble in organic solvents and size-exclusion chromatograpy indicates the formation of very regular fragments.",Switzerland,2019.06
888,"“Reuse, reduce, rethink” - 10th Annual Forum of EUSBSR focused on circular economy","The main theme of the 10th EUSBSR Annual Forum, organized in Gdansk on June 12-13 2019, was circular and sharing economy, and how these can provide an answer to demographic changes and environmental challenges.

More than 700 participants from governments, international organisations, NGOs, universities, local and regional administrations and businesses attended the Forum and shared their ideas on how to develop the regions and face the future challenges.

Annual Forum as an opportunity to put more emphasis on circular economy in the EUSBSR

The opening session on the Annual Forum addressed the main theme of the Forum, circular economy, and what it could mean to the well-being of the Baltic Sea. The welcoming words were given by Mieczysław Struk, Marshal of the Pomorskie Voivodeship, Elżbieta Bieńkowska, Commissioner, Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, Marcin Ociepa, Secretary of State in the Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Technology of Poland, Martin Roger, Ambassador of Estonia to Poland (delivers speech of PM of Estonia Jüri Ratas), Roger Ryberg, Chair of the Baltic Sea States Subregional Co-operation, Corina Creţu, Commissioner, Regional Policy – video message, and Karmenu Vella, Commissioner, Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries – video message.

In all of the welcoming speeches, circular economy was seen important. The Baltic Sea Region has a good basis but more focus is needed to maintain its position as a forerunner. In addition, circular economy is a concept that needs everyone’s contribution because no one can do it alone, as pointed out by Commissioner Elżbieta Bieńkowska. This is also a good example why macro-regional cooperation matters.

Annual Forum was also seen as a good opportunity to reflect where we are with circular economy and how to make it stronger in the EUSBSR.

In the opening session, the winners of the International Baltic Poster contest were also awarded and a report ""No time to waste. Unlocking the circular potential of the Baltic Sea Region” was presented by Adam Czerniak, Chief Economist, Director for Research at Polityka Insight.

From well-being of the sea to business and demographic changes

The three plenary sessions were dedicated to discussing circular economy from the viewpoint of environment, business and demographic changes.

In the first plenary “Going circular – a pathway to well-being in the Baltic Sea Region”, the keynote speech was delivered by Normunds Popens, Deputy Director-General, DG REGIO. The panelists discussed if EUSBSR could be an example to other regions of implementing circular economy.

The second plenary, “Business-driven approach to circular economy in the Baltic Sea Region”, addressed the question how to use EUSBSR to increase circular economy related investments in the region, and how to improve cooperation between public and private sector. The keynote was delivered by Ralfs Nemiro, Minister of Economics of Latvia.

“Demography and circularity in the Baltic Sea Region: interdependent or disconnected?” was the title of the third plenary that tackled the questions of aging population, migration and labour mobility and how circular economy could provide an answer to these challenges. The keynote was delivered by Kjell Nilsson, Director of Nordregio.

The final session of the Forum concluded that as EUSBSR turns 10 years, we have reached a state of maturity but we should not stop developing. Communicating the Strategy is more and more important, and particularly informing decision makers why proposed actions are worth doing. In these 10 years, we have succeeded in bringing citizens together and created a new way of cooperating. For the future, we need a good action plan and work on inclusiveness to keep up this work.

In addition to the plenaries, the Forum programme included diverse parallel seminars on circular economy and a networking village to meet EUSBSR stakeholders. In connection to the Forum, EUSBSR Horizontal Action Capacity organized a Participation Day on June 11 2019 for stakeholders interested in joining the EUSBSR. To increase youth participation, a Baltic Youth Camp was organized on June 8-10 where EUSBSR was an essential part of the discussions.

After the Forum, EUSBSR National Coordinators had a meeting, and as the Chairmanship rotates, Finland will take over the Chair from Denmark on the 1st of July.

889,Innovative paper products based on the principles of circular design,"The exhibition Papiro-logía / Circular Design and Interior Uses of Paper took place 11-16 June 2019 at City Hall in Ljubljana. The work of 12 master’s students from the industrial design programme was exhibited. The exhibited products show the possibilities for using paper in the interior based on the principles of circular design and effective solutions for the transition to a circular economy.

The students presented innovative paper products, including Hive – modular system of light from paper, which deliberately uses the presumption of a temporary product from a rapidly disposable material; Sensors cupola, which adapts to the needs of children with sensory integration disabilities and offers them the opportunity for quality learning, development and play; Zoobox – assembled toy, which encourages the development of motor skills, strengthens spatial orientation and stimulates imagination; Polygami – toy, which stimulates creativity, spatial perception, motor skills and enables children to explore and create their own imaginative space; Paper project + bioplastic, which is based on the discovery and generation of new, and so far unused, potential of non-recyclable paper; Chair – made out of newspaper, which shows that recycled newspaper is a construction and aesthetically suitable material for furniture; User and environmentally friendly electoral infrastructure, which gives an answer in the form of improved existing electoral equipment; Šiva – partition wall, which enables flexible modular construction of soundproof rooms, suitable primarily for solving the problem of loss of concentration in inadequately designed open spaces; Val/Wall, an integral system for sound control elements in open areas; Folding partition walls Senta and Sipha, ensuring more efficient work and greater employee satisfaction within open offices; Papertry, a device for easier quitting of smoking and Destructive game, enabling children to relax their inner tensions and recognize the limits of their own power and the transformative potential of aggression in an environmentally acceptable manner.

The entire process of designing these products was based on the established methods from the world’s leading circular economy foundation – the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. This foundation sees design as one of the most important building blocks for the transition to a circular economy.

The Regional Development Agency of the Ljubljana Urban Region (RRA LUR) is intensively directing its activities towards the creation of economically efficient and environmentally friendly development. They initiated the idea to organize this exhibition as they recognize circular design as one of the key foundations of a circular economy. The exhibited products prove that, through innovative design and cross-sectoral cooperation in the region, numerous green opportunities can be created. RRA LUR will continue to strive to upgrade and expand these opportunities at the regional and national level. The Ljubljana Urban Region is also one of the first regions to obtain guidelines and recommendations from the European Union for the transition from a linear to circular economy.

Assoc. Prof. Lucija Močnik Ramovš, MA, Dean of the Academy of Fine Arts and Design at the University of Ljubljana, is convinced that this exhibition is another excellent example of the dedication of students and professors at the Department of Industrial and Uniform Design to stimulate and establish sustainable operation in society. Their mission is also visible internationally since this year Slovenia will take part in the Milan Triennial, where the Republic will present itself with the concept “Thinking the conditions of our time” (»Misliti pogoje našega časa«), designed by the students.

At this link, you can find the publication, which is printed (as were all other exhibition materials) on paper made from non-native invasive plants (acacias and Fallopia japonica).

This paper was developed, produced and donated by the Pulp and Paper Institute (PPI). Within the framework of the partnership, PPI also provided professional support in product development for the involved students. Moreover, the leading European packaging company DS-Smith collaborated with them and provided knowledge and materials for the exhibited products.

The exhibition was created in cooperation with the Regional Development Agency of the Ljubljana Urban Region, the Academy of Fine Arts and Design of the University of Ljubljana, the Pulp and Paper Institute, the companies DS Smith and TAM-TAM and the Municipality of Ljubljana as part of the InnoRenew project.",European Union,2019.06

910,Suston Magazine | Footwear Recycling: Stepping into the Circular Economy,"Soft goods in the outdoor industry has already learned that recycling can be good for business. For footwear, this begins now.

The numbers at first seem overwhelming: over 20 billion pairs of shoes produced every year. That’s nearly three pairs per person on the planet per year. Yet only a tiny fraction, around 5%, of discarded shoes becoming recycled. What are the causes to so many shoes being produced and such dismal recycling rates?

Benjamin Marias, the Co-Director of AIR (Agence Innovation Responsable) Co-op and a consultant for sustainability in the outdoor and textile industry, is encouraged by the recent attention this issue is receiving:

“I think this is the first time we ask these kinds of questions. Previously, people would look at performance as the only indicator.”

As Benjamin sees things, there are three primary components to the shoe waste problem: the sheer volume, the increasing over-complexity of footwear and the difficulty in identifying and separating the different materials at the point of recycling. Each of these issues requires a shift from all actors involved, including consumers, businesses and designers.

When asked what the first group, the consumers, can do to mitigate the problem, Benjamin’s suggestion is simple.

“The first thing they can do is to keep their shoes as long as possible. For me, I’d prefer something that performs maybe a little bit less but lasts longer. If you run a lot, for example, after one year you can throw away your shoes. That’s a lot of shoes. Alternatively, I would want shoes I know I can do something with in the end.”

Recycling success stories like aluminum, PET, wool and paper have been premised on the availability of a homogenous material. In footwear, however, shoes constructed with a single material are a rarity. And herein lies the challenge.

For the average shoe, a recycling program would have to consider the textiles, often of mixed types, the foam for padding, the rubber for the soles and for more complex or technical shoes, there can be metals like aluminum. While consumers can influence the volume and the design, once these complex shoes are in circulation, only an equally complex and technical solution can solve the problem. This is where SOEX, its operational subsidiary I:Collect (I:CO), and their shoe recycling plant step in.

In 2013, SOEX brought together AIR and the English company In-Cycle to look at solutions for recycling complex footwear. One year later, the first prototype of a machine that could mechanically separate the different materials in shoes was built, able to sort through 100 kg of shoes every day. After five years of development and one million euros of investment, 2018 saw SOEX and I:CO launch the world’s first plant designed to recycle all types of footwear at an industrial scale. The facility, located in Wolfen, Germany (around 150 km southwest of Berlin), weighs in at 4.2 tons and has the capacity to sort through 1 to 2 tons (roughly equivalent to 2,000 pairs of shoes) of discarded footwear each day.

Shoes are collected at any one of a number of bins around Germany or through I:CO’s in-store take-back program that is run in conjunction with numerous retailers. Once the materials arrive at the plant, the first step in the process is for the shoes to be processed through a shredder, which cuts the products into smaller pieces. All the materials are then exposed to a metal separator that uses a magnet to pull out all metallic objects. The subsequent waste is then run through the delamination mill, which fractionates the composite materials, meaning that they get divided into smaller parts according to their composition. Next, the air separator divides each of the different categories – rubber, leather, foam, and more – into discrete collections. Finally, a grinder processes all the materials into standardized sizes.

The business of the plant is to sell the byproducts that are produced as a result of the recycling process. Axel Buchholz, CEO of I:CO and SOEX, explains:

“The three main applications for the recycled outsole material are new shoe soles, sports grounds and running tracks or playgrounds, and interior design objects like rugs and doormats. Applications for the recycled leather materials are currently under development.”

Yet ingenuity aside, SOEX and I:CO face other non-technical barriers to widespread adoption of footwear recycling. Buchholz mentions the problem of profitability as one of the primary factors. The process creates components (rubber, foam, leather and other materials) that are more expensive than if one were to buy these materials directly from the market. Here, he suggests a need for systemic change, with action necessary from politicians, businesses and consumers to create incentives for producers of recycled products.

With continued innovations, recycling has an increasingly important role to play, and actors like SOEX and I:CO are key to mitigating the impact of the 95% of shoe waste that ends up in landfills or incinerators. But asked where he thinks the state of recycled footwear will be in the years ahead, Benjamin is quick to recalibrate and focus on the main goal, extending the lifecycle of the product as it is:

“Recycling is at the end. It’s the choice of last resort in the circular economic model. So it shouldn’t be considered as the main goal, and that’s something that we forget sometimes.”

As with so many other numbers that document our collective impact on the planet, the amount of waste that is produced from footwear can seem overwhelming. But consumers can choose to keep and repair their old footwear. Companies and brands can design shoes that are both easier to repair and recycle. And finally, forerunners like AIR, SOEX, and I:CO can act as a backstop, recycling shoes at the end of what has hopefully been a very, very long life.",Sweden,2019.06
927,Young Suhit celebrates recovery with top EDGE prize –,"Suhit Amin of Salderson Media, pictured with Employment Minister Jamie Hepburn, was the competition’s youngest ever recipient

A teenager who founded his business while battling cancer was among 14 early stage companies which shared more than £1 million in this year’s Scottish EDGE competition.

Eighteen-year-old sixth year student, Suhit Amin, set up his now six-figure turnover influencer marketing agency, Saulderson Media whilst undergoing aggressive chemotherapy for Stage 2A Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, from which he has been in remission since September 2018.

He was among the entrepreneurs who pitched their business ideas live at Glasgow’s Technology and Innovation Centre and Edinburgh’s RBS Conference Centre last month to high-profile panels chaired by Margaret Gibson of EY Foundation and Simon Hannah of Filshill.

Addressing the finalists prior to the awards announcement, entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter said: “It’s fantastic to support Scottish EDGE; the businesses that come through EDGE grow faster with less risk because EDGE is not just about money, but the embedded support on offer.

“EDGE businesses are the lifeblood of the Scottish economy and we are delighted to support you as you grow and prosper – Scotland needs many more like you.”

The newly introduced Circular Economy EDGE Award, which is supported by Zero Waste Scotland to encourage and back entrepreneurs who are exploring circular ways of doing business, was won by Hamish Menzies of Rocio, a designer fashion brand which manufactures and sells premium wooden handbags worldwide using 100% sustainable wood and fair-trade manufacturing methods. Roccio has gained traction from celebrity influencers such as Kate Upton and Amelia Warner.

Commenting on Roccio’s win, Jill Farrell, chief operating officer at Zero Waste Scotland, said: “Right now, we are consuming huge quantities of finite resources only for them to go to waste. Rocio’s luxury wooden handbags are a fantastic example of the way products should be designed with the planet in mind. Their win should inspire fellow entrepreneurs with big ideas to change the way we live. The circular economy will be built by creative thinkers.”

The Higgs EDGE Special Award of £125,000 was awarded to Dr Peter Orrell, who set up MycoNourish as a means of harnessing the power of beneficial microbes to enhance crop production and add value for growers via customised fungi to suit the problem areas of specific crops.

As the UK’s largest business funding competition, Scottish EDGE has now awarded more than £14 million and is given as a 40% grant and a 60% loan, with a maximum award of up to £150,000. The loan is paid back to help fellow entrepreneurs on their pathway to success. Both the Young EDGE and Wild Card EDGE awards are grants of up to £15,000.

Scottish EDGE CEO, Evelyn McDonald, said: “Tonight’s ceremony offers great encouragement as a snapshot of the current state of entrepreneurship in Scotland. The vast array of exciting businesses that our panels have chosen to support, from celebrity endorsed sustainable handbags and ground-breaking cancer treatments to teenager founded marketing agencies and bagpiper illness preventers, Scotland really does offer the kind of outside-the-box entrepreneurial thinking needed to achieve recognition in a global market.

“Congratulations to the inspirational winners and also to our runners up who worked exceptionally hard to get this far. We welcome the entrepreneurs awarded tonight to our high achieving alumni of 350 previous winners who thus far have generated an additional £151 million in turnover, secured £124 million in additional investment and created 1,858 jobs.”

Gordon Merrylees, head of entrepreneurship for Royal Bank of Scotland, said: “We are both delighted and extremely proud as a bank to have been a founding supporter of Scottish EDGE since its inception in 2014 and a key funder for almost five years as part of our overall desire to help Scottish entrepreneurs start, scale and succeed.”

930,Will the Circular Economy take off in African countries?,"According to the World Bank, in 2016 the world’s cities generated 2.01 billion tonnes of solid waste, which equated roughly to 0.74 kilograms per person per day. This demonstrates a serious concern.

The UN has estimated that the global population will near 11.3 billion by 2060, with Africa expected to experience just as much exponential growth (2.5 billion by 2050), which will represent about 26% of the world’s total population.

However, it also alludes to a very serious challenge that threatens the future resilience and sustainability of cities, if we don’t change our attitudes to what we consider resources versus waste.

Globally, however, there has been strong intervention, to change both consumer attitudes as well as a practice – when it comes to waste.

Read more on: How to achieve low carbon service delivery

On 18 April 2019, Europe officially adopted the Circular Economy Package, which imposes new ambitious recycling and recovery targets on all 28 member countries. It’s remarkably the first time EU countries are required to follow a single and shared legal framework.

This Circular Economy Package looks at a number of areas to ensure there is strong reform that can be mapped across the globe – with the premise that it will become a fundamental ingredient for the implementation of a global policy in favour of the environment.

This framework mandates that by 2025, at least 55% of municipal waste will need to be recycled. The target will become 60% in 2030 and 65% in 2035. For packaging material, the target is a 65% recycling rate by 2025 and 70% by 2030. Similarly, individual targets have been set for specific packaging materials, such as paper and cardboard, plastic, glass, metal and wood.

Furthermore, another step in this framework is the uniformisation of the method for calculating performance, which allows for more coherent results where, for example, disposal in landfills will be limited to a maximum of 10% of municipal waste by 2035 and needs to be seen as the last resort.

So what about Africa – are we aligned, and why should we care?

The Circular Economy is a relatively new concept, however, in the African context it offers significant opportunities to truly deliver on more inclusive economic growth, which includes job opportunities and positive environmental practices that are direly needed for sustainable growth.

As a reformative system, the Circular Economy is a model that aims to strip out all unnecessary waste materials, energy losses and related carbon emissions across supply chains and – through integration and innovation – promotes closing these gaps to allow materials, energy and resources to be ‘fed’ back into the cycle.

The consensus is that a more sustainable eco-cycle can be achieved through long-term design and planning, maintenance, repair, reuse, remanufacturing, refurbishing, recycling, and upcycling.

While adoption of this thinking is still in its infancy in Africa, there are success stories that can be seen in pockets where, through innovation, we are also seeing new business streams and even new industries come to the fore supporting this type of thinking.

For example, the drive to divert waste from landfill has directly resulted in waste disposers or management companies merging into reprocessing industries, with significant focus being placed on reuse, recycle, repurpose. This is causing manufacturers to rethink how they design their products as well as the type of resources they use to make their goods and products of today, that will (re)become raw materials of tomorrow.

Additionally, in cases where recycling and reusing possible, we are seeing growth in safe destruction facilities as well as growth in the waste-to-energy space.

In fact, waste-to-energy plants offer a unique opportunity to tackle two critical challenges to lasting, sustainable development across Africa; power generation, and sustainably managing waste by reducing reliance on landfills.

Across industries, we are seeing a more concerted effort to find solutions that make active use of waste – building on the philosophy of reuse wherever possible. However, we need to instil a complete culture change and shift markets towards ‘giving back to the system’ in how we approach and treat resources versus waste, so as to avoid potential crises and ensure we build towards a resilient and sustainable future in Africa.

So, while there is no specific Circular Economy-related framework on the African continent, we are steering in the right direction. All that is needed now, is a mandate that all businesses follow suit – that it is not merely a means to monopolise businesses but rather, that it becomes a public and private sector priority.

942,How the circular economy holds the key to London's sustainable growth | Ethical Corporation,"Wayne Hubbard of London Waste and Recycling Board champions this week’s showcase of circularity in the capital and calls for longer-term collaborations and commitments

Our economy is based upon a “take, make, dispose” model. But we all know this approach is reaching its limit; there’s a growing realisation that it’s no longer working for businesses, people or the environment, particularly as the world’s middle class population is growing rapidly and expected to grow again from 4 billion to 5 billion between 2022 and 2028. We urgently need to develop and scale new ways of doing things to keep materials in use for longer and minimise negative environmental impacts.



 The customer demand for more sustainable approaches is clear. Nearly 90% of consumers strongly believe that society should be more resource-efficient, and the UK’s market for ethical products and services grew by more than £40bn between 2008 and 2017. In addition, almost half of those aged under 24 say they avoided a product or service in the last year due to its negative environmental impact. Ethical investment is on the rise too: in 2017, the top 100 socially responsible companies in the Standard & Poor’s index financially outperformed the rest by 7%.

A growing number of businesses, charities and social enterprises are responding to this need, with many pioneering organisations leading the way when it comes to circular business models. Wherever organisations are on their journey, collaborating and learning from each other is vital.

To help share and spread sustainable business practices, London Waste and Recycling Board launched the first ever Circular Economy Week last year, through our Circular London programme. As one of the most vibrant business hubs in the world, London is already home to fantastic sustainable innovators and entrepreneurs; so we wanted to bring together organisations of all shapes and sizes to help learn from each other and speed up the transition to a circular economy.

The inaugural week in 2018 was a great success, with a host of businesses, policymakers, entrepreneurs and actors in the resources industry coming together to explore more circular approaches to resource management, product design, manufacturing and retail. The second Circular Economy Week is now under way, with four times more events, workshops and collaboration opportunities taking place across the capital than last year. These events include sessions on how to make workspaces more sustainable, workshops on technology’s role in the circular economy, sessions on using food waste as a resource, sustainable fashion insights, and even a tour of circular businesses along the Circle Line.

Those taking part in Circular Economy Week range from Goldfinger Factory, the social enterprise that transforms reclaimed materials into furniture while teaching upcycling skills to disadvantaged young people, through to Dame, the first reusable tampon applicator, which has already saved 156 million pieces of single-use plastic from being thrown away.

Of course, Circular Economy Week is just the starting point for inspiring longer-term collaborations and commitments, helping to ensure that more organisations can thrive by adopting circular models. The transition to a circular economy could have hugely positive environmental impacts, potentially capable of preventing more than 60% of London’s waste. But it’s not just about environmental impacts – it also makes good commercial sense.

London’s population is predicted to reach over 11 million by 2050. Taking a flexible and circular approach to products, housing, office space and infrastructure is crucial to London’s ability to adapt and thrive. The circular economy provides a sustainable and profitable solution to the challenges of this dramatic growth. By 2036, the circular economy could provide London with £7bn every year in the sectors of built environment, food, textiles, electricals and plastics, as well as creating new jobs in the areas of re-use, remanufacturing and materials innovation. The circular economy can also create efficiencies and new revenue streams and product lines – all important in this time of economic uncertainty.

Cities are the engine room of the circular economy. For the first time ever, more than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas. It is the power of cities that will drive the global development of the circular economy. The past year has seen a rapidly growing appetite for action on the circular economy, and there is growing global interest. For example, New York recently hosted its own Circular City Week, and this autumn will see the first global Circular Cities Week.

London Waste and Recycling Board is committed to helping make London the place to be for innovators and circular economy entrepreneurs. Beyond Circular Economy Week, we’re also investors in the Greater London Investment Fund, recently launched by the Mayor of London to provide more than £100m worth of investment to small and diverse businesses, with at least £14m of venture capital targeted at circular economy start-ups.

We’re also supporting the best new circular economy start-up business innovations through our Circular London Accelerator, through which we’re currently providing access to our partner network as well as mentoring and business advice (in partnership with Carbon Trust) to our first cohort of innovators in the built environment sector.

Across London, we’re already building a strong community of organisations working together to deliver a more resilient, resource-efficient economy. We want many more organisations to join us: the prospect of building truly circular cities together is hugely exciting.

944,Towards a circular economy,"The European Commission adopted an ambitious Circular Economy Package in 2015 to boost global competitiveness, create jobs and generate sustainable growth. The adhesive and sealant industry continues to innovate to become more sustainable.

The package will contribute to ""closing the loop” of product lifecycles through greater recycling and re-use, and bring benefits for the environment, society and the economy. The plans will extract the maximum value and use from all raw materials, products and waste, fostering energy savings, materials efficiency and reducing Green House Gas emissions. In January 2018, it adopted a set of measures that included:

A Europe-wide ""EU Strategy for Plastics in the Circular Economy” and annex to transform the way plastics and plastics products are designed, produced, used and recycled. A communication on options to address the interface between chemical, product and waste legislation that assesses how the rules on waste, products and chemicals relate to each other.

A monitoring framework on progress towards a circular economy at EU and national level. The framework comprises a set of ten key indicators which cover the various phases such as production, consumption, waste management and secondary raw materials, economic aspects such as investments and jobs, and innovation. A report on ""Critical Raw Materials and the Circular Economy” that highlights the potential to make the use of 27 critical materials in our economy more circular.

The need for coherent policies

These EU measures highlight the importance of developing a coherent set of policies to help ensure products are manufactured, consumed and handled at the end of their lifespan in an efficient, cost-effective manner that maximises their contribution to a circular economy. To help achieve this, the European Commission ran a public consultation from 29 November 2018 – 24 January 2019 titled ""Towards an EU Product Policy Framework contributing to the Circular Economy”. Citizens, business and industries all take decisions related to products based on certain perceptions, under the influence of incentives and limitations set in (amongst others) EU policies. The Commission says: ""It is vital to obtain views from a wide range of stakeholders on these perceptions and incentives, in particular those relating to EU product policies. This will help identify in how far the current EU product policy framework is supportive to a circular economy and what potential there is for increasing this contribution.” FEICA provided input to the consultation and on 6 and 7 March 2019 participated in the Circular Economy Stakeholder Conference, organised by the European Commission and the European Economic and Social Committee, to follow and engage in the relevant Circular Economy exchanges.

To deliver the maximum sustainability benefit, it is necessary to adopt an approach that examines the entire lifespan of a product, from the raw materials and processes used to manufacture it, through the use phase, to the end-of-life processing (ease of disassembly, capability to re-use or recycle materials and components, etc.)

The adhesive and sealant industry has a long-standing commitment to sustainability and is an advocate of the lifecycle analysis approach. FEICA – the Association of the European Adhesives and Sealants Industry – has proactively engaged in discussions on the circular economy with relevant stakeholders. For example, it contributed to the development of the European Commission’s ecodesign requirements for electronic displays. This resulted in a solution for certain ecodesign requirements that will enhance the extent to which products can be dismantled without restricting product innovation and design, enabling liquid adhesives to be used if they support the design and dismantling requirements.

FEICA has produced a position paper on ""The circular economy: The role of adhesives and sealants”. FEICA believes there will be dismantling requirements for all types of bonding techniques. Adhesive producers will need to work with their customers to ensure that products can support recycle at end-of-life.

How adhesives and sealants can help achieve a circular economy

The circular economy concept creates a paradigm shift for many important sectors of European industry; successfully addressing the challenge of a circular economy is best secured if all of society is encouraged to contribute. The aims of reducing waste and ensuring full circularity of the economy go beyond what economic operators can achieve alone. It is indeed a societal challenge and FEICA members acknowledge this and are working to support such change.

The adhesives and sealants industry has been pioneering on sustainability for many years. Examples from various sectors are highlighted in the diagram above, covering the main areas of circularity and sustainable developments, showing the value improvement that adhesives and sealants deliver to a broad range of applications along different value chains:
• Energy saving: Adhesives and sealants enable solutions that save energy in the use phase of buildings and vehicles, for example for the fixation of insulation panels, the production of lightweight cars, etc.
• Material efficiency: Adhesives enable the optimised use of materials, for example composite materials for lightweight vehicles and for furniture parts, supporting the use of the renewable materials such as wood in construction
• Reparability: Adhesives enable the repair of many products, for example shoes, conveyor belts, etc., thereby extending their utility, use phase and service life
• Extending use phase: Adhesives and sealants extend the life span of products and components for example, conserving foodstuffs through re-closable packaging
• Recycling: Adhesives which do not impede/burden recycling, for example in paper recycling or the cleaning and reuse of returnable glass bottles, and which improve recycling efficiency through material efficiency because less material needs to be processed when the product is at its end-of-life

3,Europe's plastic waste sent home in toxic row | DW | 13.06.2019,"The Basel Convention amendment, endorsed only a few weeks ago, established a framework to stop the dumping of waste plastic on to developing countries. But some are worried that it is too little too late.

""Europe can no longer send its plastics problem elsewhere,"" the founder of Plasticity, Doug Woodring, says. Plasticity was founded in 2012 by Ocean Recovery Alliance, an NGO dedicated to improving the health of the oceans through what Woodring says is ""collaboration, not agitation.""

""A solution can be found, but it must be found soon. Success lies in vision and collaboration across the value chain to find circular economy solutions that work locally and wherever European products are consumed,"" he notes.

Woodring warns that the usual time required to implement Basel amendments is an invitation for what he calls ""unscrupulous dumping."" And then, when fully implemented and enforced, the very trade needed for global circular economies may be inhibited, he adds.

At the Basel Conference of the Parties from 29 April to 10 May 2019, governments amended the Basel Convention to include plastic waste in a legally binding framework intended to make global trade in plastic waste more transparent and better regulated.

The important consideration here, Woodring says, ""which many are not discussing, is that often government laws are reactionary and broad-brush in nature.""

If you all of a sudden close all borders to the shipment of commodities, then each country will have to handle its own waste management, he continues.

""This might sound easy, but for plastic, it is incredibly difficult and also hazardous, as many countries will end up burning or dumping it in order to remove it from their communities, as is done today in much of the nondeveloped world,"" he adds.

Plastic, wasteful and toxic, but enough about me

Many Asian countries, who for a decade and more were the recipients of the developed world's so-called recyclables, have now erected broad scale plastic defense mechanisms, essentially forming environmental trade barriers, Woodring says. 

 

 In addition to most of Asia's nations saying they will not take any more materials for recycling, the Philippines and Malaysia have recently started sending waste back to their shores of origin.

Countries that stand to lose heavily in the short term (until they greatly innovate their way to large-scale domestic capacity building) include Canada, the US, Spain, Britain, Australia and Japan, Woodring says.

""Germany incinerates and recycles well, so shouldn't be listed with the other countries that stand to lose heavily in the short term. ""Germany is, however on the list of countries that China has said it won't take waste from anymore, so it can expect some fallout, he adds.

These are resources, like wood, paper, glass, cloth, plastic and even food/organics, which are used again for another product, creating value from what would have been waste.

""This is the basis for which the goals of the 'circular economy' operate – whereby everything is designed for second or multiple uses, after its initial, first use as a product/package,"" Woodring says.

9,Circular economics could add sustainable billions to Dutch economy,"Shifting to a circular economy could create a plethora of new jobs in the Netherlands, while allowing the country to significantly reduce its material use intensity, according to studies by Rabobank and Oliver Wyman. As sustainability replaces globalisation as the key driver of the economy, a reversal from global to local supply chains is expected, something the Netherlands is well positioned to take advantage of.

Real concerns around the future the environment have been voiced for some time, particularly on the high-waste nature of consumer economics, with scientists warning of the impact of human activity on the environment. While such warnings have often incorrectly been taken by detractors as being an issue solely concerning other species, a UN report from last month found that human society is also in jeopardy from the accelerating decline of the Earth’s natural life-support systems.

The study painted a picture of a planet-wide tragedy, as a small range of cash crops and high-value livestock are steadily replacing forests and other nature-rich ecosystems, at a rate more in keeping with the needs of economic growth than with the actual needs of the world’s human population. The world’s leading scientists warned that, following the most thorough planetary health check ever undertaken, should human activity fail to change course, the consequences will be dire.

According to a growing number of business think-tanks, the solution to these woes is the adoption of circular economics. A circular economy (often referred to simply as ""circularity"") is an economic system aimed at minimising waste and making the most of resources. This regenerative approach is in contrast to the traditional linear economy, which has a 'take, make, dispose' model of production – and the idea is being championed by a growing cross-section of the world’s largest businesses and organisations, including the World Economic Forum and the European Union, which see it as a way of circumventing a climate catastrophe without having to shift away from growth-focused capitalism.

To that end, analysis from management consulting firm Oliver Wyman shows that a shift to circular economics would allow consumption to become “sustainable” – with fewer virgin resources required, limiting environmental harms, while creating a host of new industries to repair and repurpose goods. Not only that, the shift could actually improve the performance of the economy in the long-term.

The state of play would see humanity need the equivalent resources of approximately 1.7 earths to continue in this manner, while economic booms in the developing world mean a change in global consumption behaviour to more Western lifestyles will see natural resource exploitation increase three-fold by 2050. In the Netherlands, consumption has already reached this unsustainable level, and if this was replicated across the globe, it would take 3.4 earths to sustain.

However, exploring the possible benefits to the Dutch economy from a transition to a circular economic model, Oliver Wyman found that not only could the nation’s consumption become sustainable, it could create a number of (unforeseen) economic benefits. The negative impact of a shift from high-value first hand goods to a broader first and second-hand goods market, would be offset by increased spending in other parts of the economy as more money is made available for different types of goods and services. Meanwhile, GDP additions to the country’s economy would range between from €5.7 billion to €31 billion, while between 14,000 and 83,000 new jobs could be created.

The shift would also insulate the economy from commodity price shocks as demand for resources increases global resource scarcity – something which is expected to create a volatile commodity landscape. The study further found that the Dutch Government’s goal of €0.1 material intensity kg/GDP could be achieved by 2030 through an accelerated shift to circular economic models across the consumption spectrum.

Driving a shift to circular economic models will need a collaborative effort, requiring broad uptake from current market leaders, government and consumers. Financial institutions play a key role in unlocking various models with high initial investment costs, but long-term savings, as well as creating buffers against the risk of shifting to new business models are a key factor hampering SME innovation in the segment.

The authors conclude; “As sustainability replaces globalisation as the key driver of the economy, a reversal from global to local supply chains is expected. Given the Netherlands is well placed to be an early mover in this space, the accrued benefits of the circular economy would be amplified by exporting circular technology and processes.”

While the report illustrates the major potential which businesses see in the idea of circular economics, not everyone however is convinced. A 2017 study published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology concluded that circular economy activities can actually increase overall production, “partially or fully offset[ting] their benefits,” in that the circular economy seems to suffer from a similar rebound effect to energy-efficiency strategies. As more efficient coal plants sometimes lead to lower coal prices and therefore higher demand for coal, more efficient use of materials seems to lead to cheaper products, which are more appealing to a large number of consumers.

An article following up on the report by The Guardian meanwhile claimed that architect and thinker Walter Stahel had proposed a shift from taxing labour to taxing non-renewable resources, as a method of mitigating this rebound effect, while offering a solution to structural unemployment. However, as big business remains collectively hostile to new taxes and higher material costs, the approach has not been encouraged by the key advocates of the circular economy.

This led Smart CSOs Lab founder Micha Narberhaus and Innaxis Research Institute programme manager Joséphine von Mitschke-Collande to conclude that without a holistic framework of systemic change, and the production of “a less growth-dependent and more sustainable economic system”, circular economics would not “be worthy of the buzz it is generating.”",European Union,2019.06
11,No time to waste in the Baltic Sea | DW | 12.06.2019,"""Our big dream of freedom, 30 years ago this month, was to end communism. We have to dream big again,"" Elzbieta Bienkowska, Member of the European Commission responsible for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, said.

Speaking at the 10th Annual Forum of the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region in Gdansk on Wednesday, Bienkowska spoke of the need to start implementing some of the ideas the circular economy.

""This is not just a policy choice. It is inevitable. By 2050 we need to have had fundamental economic reform. None of us can do it alone. The Baltic Sea Strategy is a good example of this cooperation,"" Bienkowska said.

The strategy brings together eight EU member states around the Baltic Sea, representing 80 million inhabitants, or nearly 16% of the EU population: Estonia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden. The strategy also welcomes cooperation with non-EU countries from the region, Belarus, Iceland, Norway and Russia.

The European Council endorsed the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region (EUSBSR) in 2009. EU member states signed off on the Circular Economy Package (CEP) in 2018, a suite of new laws designed to create a more resource efficient Europe.

Heavy metals and chemicals poison Europe’s seas, with more than three-quarters of areas assessed in a recent report showing contamination. The worst affected was the Baltic, where 96% of the area covered in the research showed problematic levels of some harmful substances, according to the European Environment Agency.

The need for change was the key thread running through the first day of the conference. Adam Czerniak, an economist at Polityka Insight in Warsaw, for example, called for a new mindset.

""We talk a lot about growth in GDP and income. But this is unsustainable. There are limits to growth,"" Czerniak said.

He recalled what the famous economist Maynard Keynes once said that we are all dead in the long term, and added: ""That could come sooner than later. We might in fact all be dead due to the degradation of the environment.""

Circular economy business models fall into two main groups: those that propose reusing and extending service life through repair, remanufacture, upgrades and retrofits and those that turn old goods into as-new resources by recycling materials. ""Ownership gives way to stewardship; consumers become users and creators,"" says Swiss architect Walter Stahel, a leading advocate of the idea.

""We have just started the transition from a linear to a circular economy. This is about sustainable, efficient use of resources,"" Marcin Ociepa, Poland's Deputy Minister of Entrepreneurship and Technology, said, stressing the need to focus on 4 areas: sustainable production and consumption, the bio economy and new business models.

This is a market that is predicted to generate 1% to 4% growth over the next 10 years. A report from McKinsey has suggested that adopting circular economy principles could generate a net economic benefit of €1.8 trillion ($2 trillion) for Europe by 2030.

The International Labor Organization projects the net creation of 18 million green jobs by 2030, including 4 million in manufacturing and 9 million in renewables and construction, all areas that will be boosted by a shift to circular thinking.

The event allowed several companies in Poland to showcase their circular credentials.

Mevo, for example, will be the largest electric power system in Europe. Launched in the Gdansk-Gdynia-Sopot Metropolitan Area in March, it will overtake Madrid (over 2,000 electric bikes) and Barcelona (1,000 bikes) by the end of the year, company officials said.

The project is cofinanced by the European Regional Development Fund under the Regional Operational Program of the Pomeranian Province for 2014-2020.

""Despite the fact that we do not have a metropolitan law, and we are still working on a joint ticket, today thanks to Mevo the metropolis becomes a reality,"" said Aleksandra Dulkiewicz, the mayor of Gdansk.

Lotos Paliwa — one of the biggest firms in the Polish fuel market — unveiled plans for a network of Lotos Paliwa e-car filling stations in Poland.

12,Achieved Circular Economy Targets Will Leave 40 Million Tonnes Residual Waste Gap in 2035,"According to Cewep current Waste-to-Energy capacity is 90 million tonnes and the capacity for co-incineration is approximately 11 million tonnes. This leaves a gap of around 40 million tonnes.

“The transition towards a circular economy is only just beginning. Today, a quarter of the EU’s municipal waste is still landfilled. Less than half of municipal waste is recycled or composted. The new municipal waste recycling targets alone will not solve these issues. European Wasteto-Energy plants are running at full capacity. We will have a residual waste treatment crisis that will result in open fires, illegal shipments and dumping unless we act. I would like to invite the decisionmakers and all other stakeholders for a dialogue on this topic. We need to work together to find the most sustainable solution for this issue”, says Paul De Bruycker, the President of Cewep.

Cewep believes it is crucial to ensure the security of residual waste treatment in order to enable a clean circular economy. Waste-to-Energy contributes to decontamination of the cycle by treating this waste, including:
• sanitary waste items that need to be treated in a hygienic way;
• plastics and many other waste streams that contain substances of concern: phthalates, brominated flame retardants, other persistent organic pollutants, heavy metals;
• rejects from sorting and recycling facilities: parts of the waste that are of lower quality (for example degraded material that has already been recycled several times), dirty or mixed and therefore impossible to recycle;
• residual waste remaining after separate collection. These waste streams should not be returned to the resources cycle.

21,PAGE Uruguay Announces Winners of Inaugural Circular Economy Award | PAGE,"Uruguay, 5 June 2019 - Lanas Trinidad, NIDO, URUPLAC, Prendetec and Repapel were among the winners of the first-ever Uruguay Circular Economy Award, given out on World Environment Day this month. The Award was created by the PAGE Uruguay Programme to recognize initiatives and projects that are contributing to the country’s transition towards a circular economy. It is the first award of its kind in the Latin-America and Caribbean region.

The Award recognized winners in five categories: Large Companies, Cooperatives, MSMEs (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises), Educational Institutions and Communities.

Lanas Trinidad was the winner of the Large Companies category and received the prize from the Undersecretary of Industry, Energy and Mining, Olga Otegui. Lanas Trinidad was recognized for promoting environmental sustainability in the productive process and for circulating and valuing materials that would normally be treated as waste in a linear economy.

The prize in the Cooperatives category was taken by NIDO and was awarded by the National Director of Environment, Alejandro Nario. NIDO, a cooperative composed of eight women, works to promote conscious and responsible consumption with a focus on social inclusion.

URUPLAC was the winner of the MSMEs category, a prize awarded by the President of the Board of Directors of the National Development Agency, Martín Dibarboure. URUPLAC consists of two partners who have been working in recycling for more than 20 years. The company was born in 2012 as an effort by the partners to find a recycling alternative for potentially unprocessed products that are not processed in Uruguay due to lack of productive alternatives.

The prize for the Educational Institutions category, delivered by Manuel Albaladejo, the representative of the UNIDO Regional Office, was awarded to PRENDETEC of Ceibal. Ceibal has delivered almost two million devices in the Uruguayan public system, managing around 13 tons of waste and electronic devices on a monthly basis. PRENDETEC is an example of how collaboration between the education system and private companies can be used to build new assets.

Pablo Montes, the Coordinator of PAGE Uruguay, presented the award to Repapel in the Communities category. The Repapel community offers a solution to the problem of garbage throughout the country. In Uruguay, the average person generates 1.1 kg of garbage daily. At least 15% is paper or cardboard and more than 20% is plastic. Repapel promotes a system of classification and subsequent recycling of paper and PET plastic throughout the country. In doing so, Repapel generates recycled paper and plastic supplies for public schools that participate in the project and environmental education programs for all organizations.

Uruguay is one of the partner countries of PAGE (Partnership for Action on Green Economy), which seeks to contribute to the incorporation of the concept of green growth in public development policies, with the purpose of promoting the efficient use of resources and environmental sustainability. This successful first year of the Uruguay Circular Award is an important step in advancing the country's path towards sustainability.",France,2019.06

It is important to ensure appropriate waste management and prevent landfilling or incineration of valuable resources. Our goal is to ensure that reliable, harmonised standards promote preparation for reuse and material-efficient recycling. This way we can turn waste into a resource and close the loop in a sustainable way by, for example, using organic waste as fertiliser, sustainable treatment of WEEE and batteries, and recovery of critical raw materials.",Belgium,2019.06
25,"WCEF 2019: ""The circular economy in cities""","EIT Climate-KIC CEO Kirsten Dunlop emphasised the importance of systemic change as cities aim to go circular—that it will connect them to one another and scale positive climate impacts globally—during the World Circular Economy Forum (WCEF) session, ‘The circular economy in cities’, last week.

The session panel, ‘Cities leading the change,’ also featured Jan Vapaavuori, Mayor, City of Helsinki, Esther Agricola, Director and spatial development and sustainability, City of Amsterdam​, and Annerieke Douma, Director for cities and regions, Circle Economy, and explored the central role cities play as engines of the global economy and their potential to drive circularity.

Some 54 per cent of the world’s population lives in urban areas, and cities account for 85 per cent of global GDP generation. Cities are also aggregators of materials and nutrients, accounting for 75 per cent of natural resource consumption, 50 per cent of global waste production and 60 to 80 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

“The power of networks is about network effects. How do we design for the relationships between cities—between cities within the same regions or in different regions?” said Dunlop. “That leads me to the second major point, which is the principle of systems innovation. How do we create the kinds of changes we need? By orchestrating innovation in such a way that it intervenes deliberately, systematically, across boundaries… and that makes it possible to connect the cities that are learning-by-doing to one another.”

EIT Climate-KIC is uniquely positioned to leverage network effects to catalyse systemic change via its partner network of over 400 organisations, universities, startups and more—including both the City of Helsinki and the City of Amsterdam.

How can cities go fully circular?

“(Cities) can look at the relationships between innovation in energy, in mobility, in waste, in water, in food, in the design of logistics, in social innovation, economic systems—they can look at innovation across those boundaries and apply something like the circular design principle to them,” said Dunlop.

How can we enact systemic change across city borders?

Dunlop proposed using portfolio logic—thinking of the combined power of every city in Europe acting together as a massive portfolio. Every single city’s experiments in circularity, for example, could be considered in a way that allows accelerated learning from one another. EIT Climate-KIC uses an AI tool that maps the potential for these coalitions between its network members.

What is Helsinki’s vision for the future?

“I don’t think that we, Finland or Helsinki, are that good at visions. We are better at just doing things… We are good at having a holistic view, understanding that everything counts,” he replied. “Maybe the vision or programme or goal that is leading our policy the most is our aim to become carbon neutral by 2035. Of course, the circular economy plays a role in that.”

Dunlop expanded on this and described the role of cities as clients, containing the biggest concentrations of risk and of opportunity, emphasising they’re also the market makers.

“We see the city as a place and a community, instead of a bureaucracy. If you really dig deep into this way of thinking, I think that will help solve most of the problems,” concluded Vapaavuori.",Netherlands,2019.06
26,"Creating a circular economy: if you're a startup reducing waste, apply for the Green Alley Award now and win €25k! (Sponsored)","In 2018, around 380 million tonnes of plastic were produced globally. Only a small percentage of this is recycled, with most of flooding our oceans, poisoning marine life and seabirds, or going into landfills. Researchers estimate that there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish by weight by 2050, and meanwhile, villages in countries such as Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia are being ‘turned into dumpsites’. Most plastic waste that ends up in oceans or landfills comes from single-use items, such as packaging. The need for alternatives is clear, but few companies have been innovating in this space.

This is where the Green Alley Award, Europe’s first startup prize for the circular economy, comes in. The award’s mission is to nurture and promote promising business ideas that use new services, products and technologies to turn waste into a resource and battle our current plastics economy.

If your startup is innovating in the circular economy, this is your chance to take your sustainable business idea to the next level. The Green Alley Award 2019 is inviting startups to showcase their technology, service or product for the circular economy. Apply by June 25th 2019 for the chance to win €25,000, plus a crowdfunding opportunity and valuable business contacts.

The Green Alley Award targets European startups and young entrepreneurs who have developed a business model in the areas of digital circular economy, recycling and waste prevention. The award sponsors are looking for startups that are about to launch their products or services or are already in the growth phase, as well as startups who want to expand into other European markets. The sole condition is that the business idea must help reduce waste, turn waste into resources or offer a digital circular economy solution.

Last year winner, UK startup Aeropowder won the award with their unique idea for insulating material for packaging made from waste feathers. In 2017, the Finnish startup Sulapac presented a wooden, biodegradable alternative to plastic packaging.

28,"Ellen MacArthur calls on designers to ""help regenerate the planet"" by adopting circular design","Circular economy champion Ellen MacArthur has called on designers to help transform the global economy along sustainable lines.

The British former round-the-world sailor and founder of circular-economy charity Ellen MacArthur Foundation said she wanted architects and designers to join her fight to eradicate industrial waste and pollution.

""The design fraternity is absolutely a target for us, because designers build the world,"" MacArthur told Dezeen. ""So they're an absolutely vital fraternity in designing something that fits within the [circular] system.""

MacArthur, who gave up her record-breaking solo sailing career to launch her foundation, said it was vital to get designers and architects on board to ensure that products and buildings are designed to help regenerate the planet, rather than exploit it.

""I would encourage designers to think about how the creative process can build something much broader than their product, and how their product can fit in that much broader restorative system,"" she said.

""What happens when your product comes to the end of its use period? Can your product have many use periods? Can you design for the future, design for recovery, to deliver even more value in the future?""

She added: ""If you think about young people going through education today, if they want to be the designers of the future, what an amazing opportunity to be part of building a restorative, regenerative future; a future where we can recover materials and feed them back into the economy.""

MacArthur, 42, spoke exclusively to Dezeen ahead of her foundation's annual summit, which takes place in London on 13 June. The summit features a discussion about the role designers can play in encouraging the switch to a circular economy.

MacArthur explained how, after breaking the record for fastest solo circumnavigation of the world in 2005, she quit sailing in order to dedicate herself to proving the economic benefits of circularity.

""[Today's] linear economy is a straight line, no matter how efficient you make it,"" she explained. ""If you make a car with less material, if you make a car using less energy, you're still using stuff. You're still consuming materials.""

""Linear is worth less than circular""

Her foundation has set out to prove the financial benefits of a waste-free economy, producing a series of influential reports on different sectors including plastics, fashion and fast-moving consumer goods.

""Every single time we've produced a report, it's been overwhelmingly positive,"" she said. ""Linear is worth less than circular.""

Her landmark 2012 report Towards the Circular Economy was the first to set out the business and economic benefits of a sustainable economy, while the influential New Plastics Economy report of 2016 set out to rethink the way plastics are used.

It found that 95 per cent of plastic packaging, worth $80-120 billion, is wasted each year. Its claim that by 2050 there could be more plastic than fish in the sea generated headlines around the world.

""It makes you a bad designer if you make something that can't be recycled"" says Cupclub founder

Design-related initiatives by the foundation include a guide to circular design, launched last year in collaboration with design company IDEO, and a $1 million prize for new materials to replace plastic.

In 2017 MacArthur teamed up with fashion designer Stella McCartney to challenge the wastefulness of the fashion industry.

During the interview, MacArthur discussed the work of her foundation as well as her views on how to tackle ocean plastic and the wastefulness of the fashion industry.

Read on for an edited transcript of the interview:

Marcus Fairs: Tell me about your background.

Ellen MacArthur: My background was ocean racing. From the age of four, all I ever wanted to do was sail, and very quickly I decided that I wanted to sail around the world. So it was my whole life focus, from leaving school at 17, becoming a sailing instructor, trying to find a sponsor, to doing my first transatlantic when I was 21.

Then in 2001, when I was 24, I competed in the Vendée Globe, which was my first solo non-stop round the world race. Then four years later, I set out to try to be the fastest person ever to sail solo nonstop around the world in a 75-foot trimaran, which I achieved in February 2005.

Marcus Fairs: Why did you give up sailing to focus on the circular economy?

Ellen MacArthur: I never for a second thought I would settle outside sailing. I had no wish to. I'd not studied anything else. But when you're on a boat, you have finite resources. You take with you everything you need for your survival. In the Southern Ocean, you're 2,500 miles away from the nearest town. What you have is all you have.

And this sowed an unexpected seed. When I got off the boat at the end, I started to translate that understanding of what ""finite"" means for the global economy. I understand what ""finite"" is for me: when I run out, I run out. I restock at the end. But actually, [the world] can't.

It was completely contrary to everything I've ever done before. I've never reflected on global economics, or design, or material flows, or anything. But I just couldn't get this out of my head.

This was 2006. I was starting to try and understand how material flows work, how the global economy functions. I spoke to experts, scientists, economists, chief executives; not just challenging them on their business models, but trying to understand what their solutions were. How do we fix this?

I had no idea. I was just fascinated by the fact that the global economy can't work. It's not designed right; it can't run in the long term. It's linear: we take the material, we make something out of it, and ultimately it gets thrown away. And if your materials are finite, and you have a growing world population, that just can't add up.

I started to come across ideas like cradle-to-cradle design, industrial symbiosis, biomimicry, the sharing economy. I started to see that these ideas could come together to build a different economy that is designed to cycle; where not only are you cycling the materials that sit within that economy, but you are also keeping the product at the highest value. Suddenly you see the straight line turn into a circle.

Yet at that stage, I had no idea whatsoever of the economics behind it, whether it costs 10 times more to put into practice. But when I started talking to people about linear versus circular, something resonated: if linear can't work, maybe circular can.

So we created the foundation on the back of that, with a goal to accelerate the transition to a circular economy. The first thing we did was look at the economic rationale for it. What's it worth? Can it happen financially? And every single time we've produced a report, it's been overwhelmingly positive: linear is worth less than circular.

Marcus Fairs: What is the circular economy?

Ellen MacArthur: The linear economy is a straight line, no matter how efficient you make it. If you make a car with less material, if you make a car using less energy, you're still using stuff. You're still consuming materials.

Whereas within a circular model, from the outset you design in a way whereby that product comes back into the system: the components are recovered, the materials are recovered, the item itself is perhaps distributed in a different way, via providing mobility, rather than selling a car. And then you've created that circular system.

The first two elements of creating the circular economy are to design out waste and pollution; and to design so that you can keep products, materials and components at their highest value and utility at all times. This often requires a change in business model. So for example Philips would not be selling lighting, but actually providing lumens as a service. It's about the design of the business model as much as the product itself, so that it can fit within that [circular] system.

And then the third element is to regenerate natural systems; to look at biological materials such as compostable plastics, paper, cotton, human waste, or agricultural waste, and see how you can feed that back into natural systems to regenerate. For many years, we've talked about making an agricultural field last a bit longer, with fertilizer and pesticides. But actually, can you regenerate them, can you increase the value of the soil?

Marcus Fairs: What does it mean for designers?

Ellen MacArthur: When you begin to design a product, you have a design brief. It could be anything but let's take plastic packaging as an example. Is that design brief to keep that chicken fresh for as long as possible with clever design?

And more often than not today, the design brief is to be ultra clever to do this job. The brief is not for it to fit within a system. We're not designing for disassembly: either a chemical disassembly or recovering those materials. So it would be going back to the beginning of the design of a product, and designing it differently.

Marcus Fairs: You've worked with different sectors and produced a range of reports. Tell me about that.

Ellen MacArthur: In the early stages, we were looking at the economic value of a circular economy. The first report came out in January 2012. We took five products: cotton, a light commercial vehicle, a washing machine, a mobile phone and a smartphone. We didn’t know whether it would be economically viable for any of those to be circular. But in all five cases we found it was better economically to be circular than linear. The figure was $630 billion [in savings] per year - and that was only based on recycling less than 25 per cent of the components, materials and products. So actually, there’s a huge economic value in shifting from linear to circular.

Then we did a second one on fast-moving consumer goods, which was 700 billion US dollars [of savings], and a third one looking at global supply chains, which was over a trillion US dollars. We really began to prove that circular is an economic benefit.

Marcus Fairs: When did you start looking at plastic?

Ellen MacArthur: When you look at circular economy examples, heavy industry such as automotive or trains is actually relatively straightforward to do. When you look at high-volume, low-value plastic packaging, that's much more complex, because not even the biggest player in the world can fix it on their own. You need to change the whole industry. In order for that to be enabled, you need to change the system.

We looked at various different examples of material streams we could change, and the one we went for first was plastic packaging. We looked at these different reports, and we first of all wanted to understand the global flows of plastic packaging. Where does it come from, where does it go? It sounds like it should be straightforward, but it actually wasn't.

So we did analysis with McKinsey, and we produced the New Plastics Economy, our first report on plastic packaging, which came out at the World Economic Forum at Davos in 2016. It was, I think, the most picked-up report in the history of the World Economic Forum. It really did go big. And that was the report that said by 2050, there'll be more plastic in the ocean than fish if we continue on the current trajectory.

So that not only had a massive impact from a messaging perspective, but it was also the first time that we really saw the numbers. The fact that out of 78 million tons of plastic packaging, only 14 per cent globally gets collected for recycling, 32 per cent leaks into the environment, 14 per cent gets incinerated, over 40 per cent gets landfilled.

Of the 14 per cent that's recovered recycling, 4 per cent is lost in the sorting process, 8 per cent gets down-cycled to lesser quality materials. It's almost like one loop and it's out. And only 2 per cent of 78 million tons actually cycles into the material of the same quality. So whereas we felt we were quite good at recycling, actually there's the statistics.

Marcus Fairs: How is your message going down with big corporations that are big users of plastic? Do people like Unilever and PepsiCo understand? Do they want to change?

Ellen MacArthur: Yeah, absolutely. We work with PepsiCo, we work with Unilever. Through this whole plastics journey, we have always worked with the brands. And actually, it's not that often that Coke and Pepsi are in the same room talking about plastics. That's not traditionally been done.

I think what we've seen in the past was that these guys did care, and they were trying to do things, but everyone had their innovation and their own direction. Unilever is doing this, Coke's doing this, Pepsi's doing this, and everyone's trying to fix it, in inverted commas, but actually, the system has to change. That needs a concerted effort of everyone moving in the same direction, and that's what we set out to do with the New Plastics Economy.

Marcus Fairs: Has the foundation's work led to real change?

Ellen MacArthur: Yes, absolutely. As a result of the New Plastics Economy work, we've now got a significant group of countries, companies, organisations, who've signed the global commitment. I don't know, what's the latest number? 350 plus. It goes up weekly. The global commitment, absolutely committed to time-bound, changeable targets on plastic packaging, design, output, and feeding back into the system. Now we have over 20 per cent of the global market in plastic packaging signed up to our global commitment.

So this isn't just a report showing the numbers we need to change this; this is actually something that people are committing to. It's moving towards a tipping point where you have the biggest players in the world shifting their model to be recyclable, compostable, reusable, and making all their plastic have value.

Marcus Fairs: What about the oil companies? Are they on board with what you're doing?

Ellen MacArthur: We have many conversations with the chemical companies because they actually produce plastics. How they produce the plastics in the future is an ongoing conversation. Today, broadly, they're extractive and consumptive. But there is absolutely that question of conversation around the future of the plastics that they produce. Is it that virgin feedstock from oil? Or do they take in the materials that come from recycling facilities and make new plastics?

There is absolutely a conversation going on. Now we're seeing some huge shifts from some of the biggest plastic packaging producers in the world.

Marcus Fairs: Can you give an example?

Ellen MacArthur: Amcor was there right [with us] at the beginning. They're one of the biggest plastic producers. They're not going to make any single-use, non-recyclable plastic after 2025.

Marcus Fairs: So industry is signing up but what about governments and legislators?

Ellen MacArthur: You're shifting a system. And that makes it much easier for the legislators to change legislation because traditionally, legislation was lobbied against by business because it was going to challenge profits and employment and create challenges. But with the circular economy, we tend to see a parallel conversation between the companies that are producing the materials and the legislators. Companies want to be circular, and legislation can really help them.

Marcus Fairs: Where do you stand on the fossil-fuel plastics versus bioplastics issue? Is the solution to carry on pumping fossil fuels out of the ground, but make circular use of the plastics? Or is the solution to move to bioplastics?

Ellen MacArthur: Ultimately there's going to be a mixture of the two. I mean, oil is a really valuable resource. But you could say the same about steel. Steel comes out the ground, we're extracting iron ore out of the ground and making steel. Actually, steel recycling rates are quite high. But it's still something that we're extracting, we're taking it and we're feeding it into a system.

So do we use petrochemicals in that system? Yes, absolutely. But the petrochemicals need to be put into a renewable system, a recycling system. You have to design out the waste. Oil is an incredibly valuable resource; we can do so many different things with it. But when we make things from it, make sure that that product sits within the system.

And obviously bioplastics is part of that, compostable packaging is part of that, paper packaging, cellulose packaging, starch-based packaging, all of that. There will be many different solutions to enable the circular economy to happen. But what sits behind that is that the plastic packaging that's produced needs to be recyclable, compostable, or reusable.

Marcus Fairs: Plastic pollution of the oceans has become a huge issue. Is this something you became aware of when you were sailing?

Ellen MacArthur: When I went around the world I didn't go into the Pacific really. I did, but I was really far south around Antarctica.

Marcus Fairs: You must've seen plastic bottles bobbing around.

Ellen MacArthur: Not many really because I was in the Southern Ocean, where there were strong currents, where actually this stuff doesn't sit. If it's there, it just flows. Of course, I've seen stuff in the ocean, but generally around the coast of the UK, or France where I'm training, or the States where I'm racing too, or the Caribbean. Generally it's not out in the ocean. Not that it's not there; there's tons of it there. But that's not where I came to this from. I came to this from materials, from flows, and trying to understand the wider system.

Marcus Fairs: What can we do about plastic in the ocean? We wrote a story recently highlighting the difficulties The Ocean Cleanup is facing as it tries to remove floating plastic from the Pacific.

Ellen MacArthur: When it comes to ocean plastics, we can guess at what's out there. No one really knows. The oceans cover two thirds of the planet, and there's an awful lot of it out there. Not just the big stuff like the bottles and crisp packets and the earbud stalks that we see in our rivers from our sewage systems - and more so in the developing world than the developed world. But still you walk along the banks of the Thames, you find stuff everywhere. It's a big issue. Nobody really understands the scale of that issue, not just from the big plastics perspective, but also micro plastics and micro beads, which legislation is moving fairly swiftly on.

But micro plastics come from washing clothes, and we reckoned in the New Plastics Economy report that there was half a million tons of micro plastics washed into the oceans every year, which is the equivalent of 50 billion plastic bottles. We can't even see that. And those micro plastics are being found on every beach pretty much everywhere in the world. They've been found in the Arctic. It shouldn't really be there at all. But we don't really understand the implications.

So trying to get what we can out of the ocean is really important, because it shouldn't be there. And it's causing massive damage to wildlife; it's horrendous. What we do at the foundation is go to the beginning of the chain to try and stop it getting there in the first place. We're not an ocean cleanup organisation - that's been done by many phenomenal organisations with new technologies, and a lot of time and effort has been put into that. That absolutely has to happen, but you need to change the system because every year more and more is going into the oceans. And that's where we sit. It's the design side. It's the upstream design. So there's downstream collection, but you need to innovate upstream.

Marcus Fairs: To stop it getting in the ocean.

Ellen MacArthur: To make it have value actually. So if you make 100 per cent of your plastic recyclable, compostable or reusable, everything has value. From the outset whatever that piece of plastic is, it has value and it's designed to fit within the system. And when you look at plastic packaging today, a lot of the waste is these small-format sachets made of multilayer film. They're massively sold in emerging markets. They have shampoos and soaps, and they're very cheap, they're very sellable. They're a fast growing part of the fast-moving-consumer-goods market.

But actually, the fact is, they're never going to be recovered, they don't really have any value at all, they're not really recyclable. And even if they were, they blow away. So part of what we've worked on with the New Plastics Economy is that we need to be able to design plastic so it's recyclable, compostable, reusable.

We believe 50 per cent of all plastic packaging should be designed to be recyclable. So we still have plastic, but it has a value, it will fit very clearly within the system. 20 per cent of plastic packaging needs to be reusable, so it's recyclable but gets used many times. And then 30 per cent needs to be redesigned. It's that small-format sachet that we don't believe can be economically recycled.

Marcus Fairs: Redesigned to not exist any more you mean?

Ellen MacArthur: To be out of different material, or a different business model for distribution. So rather than buying a little plastic sachet of soap in an emerging market, we need sachets of a different material, different dispensers, just different ways of getting that product to those people without creating millions of tons of plastic waste, because that's all it will ever be if it's designed in that way.

Marcus Fairs: Tell me about the work you did in the fashion sector.

Ellen MacArthur: We felt that textiles was another huge topic. Over the last 15 years, we've doubled our production of textiles, yet we wear them 40 per cent less. We started to understand the landscape around textiles, and then we produced our second report on a systemic initiative, which was looking at the textiles industry globally - the size of it, what percentage is recycled, what happens to the fibres, the complexity of it - to try to do the same thing, to get consensus from the industry.

It's not just the fashion brands: it's the yarn suppliers, it's the chemical companies that provide the materials for the yarns, it's the recycling companies that provide the technology to recover their materials. You have to everybody in to change that system.

Like with plastic, we started to uncover the numbers around what level of textiles are recovered for recycling, which was staggeringly low. 75 per cent of clothing is thrown away. And only 1 per cent of clothing that is recovered actually gets recycled into new clothing.

Marcus Fairs: What happens to the rest of it?

Ellen MacArthur: Landfilled. 75 per cent gets landfilled or incinerated when it's thrown away. That's huge. So again, you have this massive industry. From a carbon-emissions perspective, the textile industry today is the equivalent to all international transport and shipping combined. It's huge, and it's growing.

Ellen MacArthur: Yeah, we spent a lot of time with her team. They worked on the initial report. They're very forward thinking when it comes to sourcing different materials. And Stella's very open minded when it comes to different business models as well. Some brands are very much against the growing market of secondhand sales or used goods. But actually that market's growing very, very quickly with new companies like The RealReal or Rent the Runway, they're now valued at a billion dollars. In the next three years, we reckon that whole industry will be valued at $41 billion.

So it's a very fast growing industry. And Stella's quite open to that different model.

I think what we're beginning to see in some of the very rapidly developing countries like China are small companies starting up from scratch, creating clothing opportunities for people that aren't about buying clothing, but having the provision of clothing.

And some of those statistics are huge. [Clothes-rental platform] YCloset in China has got millions of users, there's 125,000 clothing options, and they've come from nowhere to create that value. And that really works for people because they don't have time to shop, they don't have anywhere to store the stuff. They don't want to have loads of things. I mean, how many things do you need? You need what you're wearing every day and a few spares, and that's it.

Marcus Fairs: What is your message to architects and designers?

Ellen MacArthur: The top line, I would say, is does what you design fit within a system? When you design your product, what happens to those materials when it comes to the end of its use period? Or what it's next use period? Or can you recover the components from that item? Whether it's a phone, or a building, or a vehicle, is it designed for disassembly? Is it designed for recovering the materials, can you get them back out again? That would be one element, absolutely. Because if you can't, you're designing part of that linear system.

And the design fraternity is absolutely a target for us, because designers build the world. They build items, and buildings, and this is the future. They create what we see around us. So they're an absolutely vital fraternity in designing something that fits within the system.

If you're a designer of furniture, is the cotton covering of that furniture going to get used for something else? Could it be chopped up and turned into stuffing? Are the inks non toxic? Could you compost it? If the product is non toxic, but toxins are used to produce the materials, have you really designed for that system? It's going right back and looking. When you think of a chair, you think of designing a chair, that's a certain skill set it. But how do the materials that sit within that chair fit within the broader system?

Marcus Fairs: Where can designers go to find out about materials?

Ellen MacArthur: There's an organisation called Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute based in the US, and they have a huge database of products, chemicals, which are okay, so they're vetting thousands and thousands of products.

I would encourage designers to think about how that creative process can build something much broader than their product, and how their product can fit in that much broader restorative system. And what happens when your product comes to the end of its use period? Can your product have many use periods, to design for the future? To design for recovery, to deliver even more value in the future. If you can get what's in it out, all the components out, or keep it's highest value for longer. So think about not just the design of now, but the design of the future.

Marcus Fairs: You seem optimistic about the future.

Ellen MacArthur: Massively. It's an opportunity. And if you think about young people going through education today, if they want to be the designers of the future, what an amazing opportunity to be part of building a restorative regenerative future. A future where we can recover materials and feed them back into the economy.",United Kingdom,2019.06

36,What is a circular economy?,"Today marks the start of Circular Economy Week, a time where circular economy initiatives happening across the capital are launched into the spotlight.

From talks on London's cleantech industry, to compost and food waste demos, and workshops revealing how businesses can adapt to accommodate regulatory changes, there is much to see, hear and learn.

But this, of course, assumes Londoners are familiar with the workings of a circular economy, and at the very least, know what it is...

If you are scratching your head at the term, fear not! Here is a cheat sheet on what you need to know about a circular economy and Circular Economy Week.

It's an economic system formed on the principles of recycling and minimising waste.

In contrast to a linear economy (more on which below) a circular economy is based on the idea that what is made can be used, reused, recycled and remade for use once again. Production and use goes round in a circle, with as little waste as possible.

A linear economy is that which we currently operate in. It's where what is made, is used, then more often than not, thrown away (usually sent to landfill).

Circular economy campaigners want to change this.

What are the benefits of a circular economy?

Circular London - the programme established by London Waste and Recycling Board, who are leading Circular Economy Week – estimate that by 2036, a circular economy could deliver up to £7bn to London each year. This would be generated through such industries as built environment, food, textiles, electricals and plastics.

It is estimated a circular economy could also create as many as 40,000 new jobs.

How can we switch to a circular economy?

""We need to develop and scale new ways of doing things to keep materials in use for longer and minimise negative environmental impacts,"" a spokesperson for Circular London said.

""The transition to a circular economy could have hugely positive environmental impacts, with a potential reduction of more than 60 per cent in waste for London.""

It is for this reason that Circular Economy Week was conceived; to introduce decision makers – from business leaders to government personnel – to the benefits of the system.

What is the aim of Circular Economy Week (CEW)?

To help find the circular and sustainable approaches that could bring a circular economy to fruition. Businesses, government and NGOs from across London are set to take part in this, the second CEW, which runs from today until June 14.

Organisations involved include Winnow – a kitchen technology using AI to monitor food waste and formulate how to reduce it; DAME, the world's first reusable tampon applicator, made using medical grade materials and self-sanitising technology, and the Goldfinger Factory, which centres on upcycling homeware and teaching sustainable craftsmanship skills to disadvantaged young people.

38,Estée Lauder joins CE100 and develops reusable/refillable packs,"The CE100 is a global platform that brings together cross-industry corporations, governments, cities, academic institutions and emerging innovators from around the world to accelerate the transition to a circular economy. The network enables members to collaborate and unlock new opportunities that support the objective of building a framework for an economy that is restorative and regenerative by design. Through acceleration workshops, Co.Projects, an extensive portfolio of learning materials and an annual summit, members have access to a broad range of learning, networking and collaboration opportunities.

The CE100 membership is the latest collaborative initiative that supports the company’s sustainable packaging goals. Through this membership and those with the Sustainable Packaging Coalition (SPC) and the Sustainable Packaging Initiative for CosmEtics (SPICE), The Estée Lauder Companies will continue to learn, build capacity, and collaborate on sustainable packaging innovation.

As part of the drive, Estée Lauder’s team of packaging designers and material engineers will re-design the majority of its packaging portfolio, switching items currently made from fossil-fuel-based polymers with pulp or bio-based alternatives. Where this is not possible, recycled content will be used. The company has also vowed to develop reusable and refillable packaging.

Nancy Mahon, senior vice president, global corporate citizenship and sustainability, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., said: “As a global company, employer and corporate citizen, The Estée Lauder Companies is committed to taking positive actions to ensure a healthier planet for all. Driving circularity through sustainable packaging innovation is a priority for us and we believe a collaborative cross-industry approach is key to making meaningful progress. We are proud to be joining the Circular Economy 100 (CE100) programme, run by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and look forward to working with the Foundation and its members who are at the forefront of the transition to a circular economy.”

Estée Lauder, which owns brands such as MAC, Too Faced, SmashBox and Jo Malone London , said it is actively identifying opportunities to take advantage of advances in bio-sourced materials, substitute virgin content for recycled content, and use components from less carbon-intensive materials. It also has a range of packaging return schemes. The company has a number of key pledges and programmes in place, including:
• By the end of 2025, 75-100% of ELC brands’ packaging will be recyclable, refillable, reusable, recycled or recoverable; in achieving this goal, the Company will increase the amount of post-consumer recycled material in packaging by up to 50%
• ELC’s ambition is to use responsibly sourced paper products whenever possible with a goal to have 100% of its forest-based fibre cartons FSC certified by 2025
• To achieve these goals, ELC’s packaging designers and engineers are re-engineering the packaging portfolio, including low-impact sourcing, bio-sourcing, material substitution, weight elimination and integration of recycled content
• Aveda was the first beauty company to use 100% post-consumer recycled PET. As of today, more than 85% of its skin care and hair styling PET bottles and jars contain 100% post-consumer recycled materials
• Origins created the first cosmetic container recycling programme in the industry, ‘Return to Origins’, and M.A.C. also runs a packaging return scheme, ‘Back2MAC’
• ELC is on target to meet its 2020 goal to achieve net zero carbon for Scope 1 and 2 and to source 100% renewable electricity (RE100) across all global operations. The Company recently announced it would build upon this existing net zero commitment and set a science-based target covering Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2020

56,Plastic in our life - The Malta Independent,"The Environment and Resources Authority (ERA) is currently engaged in a public consultation regarding single use plastic. This contrasts with the more wide-ranging EU strategy which considers plastic in a wider, and more holistic, context.

The basic issue to be addressed is the need to entrench life-cycle thinking in our policy-making. This signifies, in particular, that in the manufacture and use of materials, the environmental impact at each stage of a product’s ‘life’ is considered and analysed at the drawing board. This is a process which runs from the very resources used in the production right up to the disposal or reuse of the product.

The current debate is concerned with the disposal of single use plastic which is the source of a waste stream that needs to be urgently addressed because it has increased exponentially over the years.

The public consultation document issued by the ERA is entitled: Single-Use plastic products Strategy for Malta. On the other hand, the EU strategy document is entitled A European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy.

The local debate is being channelled towards addressing the minimisation of waste in contrast to the EU debate which is more wide-ranging, focusing on the role of the circular economy. The contrast is significant and identifies the lack of depth in local policy-making.

The most obvious issue with plastic is the need to reduce its contribution to the waste stream. In this respect, the Maltese consultation document adequately addresses the need to reduce consumption as well as the improvement of the economics and quality of recycling. It identifies a number of items in daily use that are part of the problem. Essentially it focuses on the disposal society, with disposable cups, straws, cutlery, bottles and food containers topping the list.

We have to address our behaviour and opt more often to use non-disposables! It is an uphill struggle to avoid moving along the road on which we have been led for so long.

Ironically, among the policy options that the Maltese consultation document highlights are economic disincentives and fiscal measures. This might remind readers of the ‘eco-contribution’ which was introduced in a haphazard manner by the Lawrence Gonzi administration way back in 2005. This fiscal measure was brought about in order to address the waste generated by single-use plastics: primarily plastic water bottles.

The eco-contribution was scrapped by the current government. It would be interesting if we could have more information as to what fiscal measures are being contemplated as part of the implementation process of the local plastics strategy because through a perusal of the consultation document, we are none the wiser.

It would be pertinent to point out that one of the practical measures being contemplated to address head-on the recycling of plastic bottles is a plastic packaging deposit scheme. If implemented, this would go a long way to addressing the plastic waste stream. Way back in 2004/5 this same proposal was put forward by beverage producers in Malta as an alternative to the introduction of the eco-contribution. The proposal was unfortunately shot down by representatives of retailers as they did not want to deal with waste.

Less bickering in the past would have placed the country in a much better position to address plastic waste today. Fifteen years of productive work have been lost as the then government did not have the will to proceed.

The EU plastics strategy goes much further than addressing the plastic waste stream. We require a clear vision on the role of plastics in the circular economy, a point which is missed by the local strategy. Challenges must be transformed into opportunities through which the use of resources is maximised.

Take a look at nature. It does not waste anything. The leaves that a tree sheds are taken up by the soil as a source of nutrition and recycled. The basic idea of the circular economy is modelled on nature, which works in a cyclical manner.

This ought to be the way forward. We need a strategic vision not just on how to deal with plastic waste, but more on how the use of plastic could contribute to the circular economy.

57,Capture the power of waste heat from Europe’s towns and cities,"In an innovative circular economy move, an EU funded programme aims to capture the power of waste heat from Europe’s towns and cities.

The programme, Life4HeatRecovery project, is looking to use the wasted energy as an available resource to heat homes and supply hot water.

The average mid-sized supermarket in Europe produces enough waste heat from its refrigeration and air conditioning units in one year to be able to provide the thermal energy needs of 200 homes over the same period.

It’s not just supermarkets producing this kind of waste – there are data centres, factories, hospitals, offices and many other buildings and institutions in towns and cities all over Europe producing this energy as a by-product of their activities, all too often just wasted into the atmosphere.

Life4HeatRecovery is an EU LIFE programme funded project looking to use wasted energy recovered from different sources and apply it to district heating systems. To do this efficiently, the project is developing complete, pre-fabricated “skids”, which collect the waste energy using heat pumps.

Roberto Fedrizzi, of EURAC Research, who coordinates the Life4HeatRecovery project explains how this works: “The heat pumps are used in two ways. The low-temperature waste heat can be warmed to a level that is useful for district heating.

“This is done by connecting a heat pump to this waste source, which increases the temperature of the available heat from around 10-30ºC to 70-80ºC. This is then connected to the district heating system and the heat is made available for traditional district heating networks.”

He continues: “The other possibility, however, is for a new generation of district heating networks. These directly distribute the waste heat through the network: this heats the water in the network to around 10-20ºC and this low-temperature water is distributed to the door of the buildings on the network.

“Of course, this low-temperature water is not a useful supply of domestic hot water or heating, but it can be warmed up to a useful heat at the individual buildings using heat pumps. The value here is that the low-temperature water does not suffer heat losses along the network pipelines.”

There is an abundance of waste heat that can be used in this way, while recovering it from these sources using heat pumps is also a relatively cheap process. “We are studying different business cases for our technology,” explains Fedrizzi, who acknowledges that though this is a complicated, early market place, there are several reasons to be optimistic about future success.

At the moment, the project is working at four demo sites: a foundry in Italy, a hospital and a detergents factory in the Netherlands, and a solution in Germany where waste heat is being recovered from sewers from warm water that leaves people’s bathrooms.

Fedrizzi is confident that this work will deliver exciting results. As well as the energy savings to be made and the associated reduction in emissions and the use of fossil fuels, this type of waste recovery will also generate significant employment opportunities in the towns and cities where it is deployed.

“By using real-life examples of waste heat recovery in action, companies will be making decisions at the local level that impact on their local area directly – reducing CO , creating jobs, reducing heat islands and providing heat and hot water to homes,” concludes Fedrizzi.

58,Coke to spend Sh3.8bn on recycling,"Beverages manufacturer Coca Cola will spend Sh3.8 billion to activate a collection and recycling value chain for plastic bottles across Eastern and Southern Africa.

Saying the three year exercise was part of its efforts towards achievement of a global ‘World Without Waste’ vision, Coca Cola said the investment will see a value chain created to recover every empty bottle of its products and facilitate recycling.

“What makes Africa different when it comes to recycling is that every bottle we collect in Africa is recycled in Africa,” said Coca-Cola Southern and East Africa President Bruno Pietracci in a statement last week.

He said several companies using plastic bottles to package their products had united to activate the chain creating jobs and thereby giving birth to a circular economy where PET packaging has value and life beyond its initial use.

Since January, Coca Cola and its partners had injected Sh517 million ($5.125 million) to boost recycling industries in Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.",United Kingdom,2019.06
67,Closing the Circle on Plastic Recycling,"Four young professionals behind the Denmark-based startup BlueBenu, which aims to tackle the issue of plastic waste, have been in Budapest as part of the Design Terminal mentoring program.

Unlike other methods on the market, BlueBenu’s solution is able to turn unsorted, unclean plastic waste into new plastic product while also producing eco-fuel along the way. The Budapest Business Journal talked with COO Sarah Lasso and CTO Albert Kravos.

BBJ: Right at the top of the list of recommendations to reduce plastic waste is cutting the use of single-use plastic bags. What role do you think recycling has here?

Albert Kravos: Single-use plastic bags have their downsides but the biggest problem is that people don’t throw them in the trash or separate them appropriately. Consumers are responsible for the first separation and proper sorting before plastic enters the recycling bins. Governments should be responsible for providing local recycling stations instead of shipping waste overseas to places where policies are not applied vigorously, are poorly supervised, or not enforced at all by the authorities. Our plans extend to tackle the waste of poor communities, in order to address the source of plastic pollution and give waste plastics a means for recycling.

Sarah Lasso: Sometimes communities are environmentally aware but have no waste management practices; they have no other choice but burning or throwing it away in improper locations such as the open environment. We want to give them an option to not only recycle, but also to use the potential of the plastic as a resource.

BBJ: In what way does your solution differ from similar ones already on the market?

AK: There are many ways to recycle plastic but they mainly need the waste to be sorted and cleaned. Our method is much more flexible as it can handle plastic that is contaminated or mixed with organic matter. This conversion process itself is not new. We have, however, adapted it from exclusively treating biomass to a more versatile use and to tackle plastic feedstock that cannot be traditionally recycled or is tricky to work with. The technology is called hydrothermal liquefaction, where we basically pressure cook the plastic with water in order to bring the material back to its original petroleum form.

As an output, we have different product streams, one is eco-fuel. The fuel produced depends on the feedstock: in the beginning it would resemble light sweet crude oil, which needs to be refined to be used in cars. It could also be directly used in ships and heavy-fuel oil engines. In the long run, we aim to produce jet fuel, it being difficult to replace otherwise. Our ultimate purpose, however, is not to produce fuel but rather new virgin plastics and high value petrochemicals to close the circular economy of plastics and considerably reduce emissions.

SL: In the beginning, the idea was to fully focus on maritime as ships use very low-quality fuel. Also, there have been many new legislations that they have to comply with. We moved away from the maritime fuel idea to focus on a fully circular economy process of reintegration of waste in the system as high value products. These new propositions have the potential to generate bigger socio-economic value for communities around the globe.

BBJ: Where are you at with development?

SL: Right now we are at the prototype stage, but we are a bit slow due to lack of funding and also because we are trying to develop it together with the market so as to comply with pre-existing standards for specific industrial uses. It is a very complex and expensive project and we want to ensure a perfect product/market fit.

AK: The product is a small container-sized reactor which was designed in the first place to convert biomass into biodiesel. We are redesigning the reactor so that it can also accept mixed plastics and run continually.

BBJ: Are you already in touch with companies?

SL: We have partnered with Spike Renewables, an equipment manufacturer based in Florence. We have established contacts with municipalities and public bodies in Myanmar and Denmark. Municipalities are responsible for implementing waste collection systems and either end up sending the plastic fraction to incineration or landfill. Here we want to open new solutions. And we are still in contact with the Danish maritime industry and associations for treating marine litter brought to shore by vessels and fisherman.

BBJ: Why did you choose to come to Hungary and participate here in a mentoring program?

SL: We are based in Denmark so we are familiar with the Scandinavian market. We wanted to open up a bit; looking for new partnerships, seeing how other markets operate. At Design Terminal’s mentoring program we participate in training, mentoring and meetings with corporate partners. This is also a community of committed startups that will be a promising network for the future. Moreover, we are experiencing personal growth and also sharpen our expertise in many different sectors.

AK: During the power camp, we made contacts with some local refineries, which helps us to better understand their limitations in terms of infrastructure, so we got a clear idea of what fuels they will or will not accept. As a result, we can streamline our product development. We have also learnt more about market analysis in this way. We are looking for funding opportunities, although, we may still be early for angel investment as we are dealing with expensive hardware; we are not sure if dilution would be beneficial at this stage. We are currently applying for soft funds from the [Danish] government and the EU.",Hungary,2019.06

76,Let’s not reinvent the wheel in pursuit of a circular economy | Ethical Corporation,"Sustainability consultant Amita Vaux says in the debate over deposit return schemes it should be noted that Wales, with no deposit return scheme, ranks among the four highest recycling countries in the world

Mid-May was the deadline for public responses to Defra/HM Treasury consultations on waste and resource reforms. On the table were proposals to make kerbside recycling more consistent; a deposit return scheme (DRS); and a tax/responsibility system for plastic packaging manufacturers. This short article shares some of my observations in reviewing the consultation papers on behalf of Business in the Community (BITC), in order to engage private and public sector organisations in and submit a consolidated response to the government. What follows is neither the voice of BITC or its members.

The DRS and a tax on plastic packaging manufacturers, mooted at 20%, have been championed by both Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Chancellor Philip Hammond. And many would say rightly so. They represent tried and tested systems that have transformed recycling rates in OECD countries around the world.

But is it worth pausing to ask, are we over-thinking, over-engineering and over-pricing something we already have, albeit in a less than optimal form? In short, are we reinventing the wheel on existing circular economy infrastructure?

During the BITC debates and through my own research, I became increasingly convinced that consistency in household and business recycling, while not sexy or smart, is the bedrock of all other reforms. Improving existing kerbside collections may not even require us to look to Germany, Sweden or South Korea for inspiration – Wales ranks among the four highest recycling countries in the world, with no DRS, no producer tax and no overly complex producer responsibility system.

It met its 64% 2020 recycling target back in 2016 simply by setting statutory targets for local authorities, policed with fines. For cash-strapped councils, this forced action, with some passing on fines of up to £100 to residents who consistently fail to recycle. Wales is now working towards zero waste by 2050, with an intermediary milestone of 70% recycling by 2025.

Creative marketing could help residents see the value of their waste. (Credit: photographyfirm/Shutterstock)

We might also look at precedents set by top-performing local authorities in England. Last year, East Riding of Yorkshire topped the leaderboard at 64.5% recycling rate, closely followed by Rochford and South Oxfordshire District Councils (both at 63%). Before Defra and HM Treasury move to the next phase of consulting, would it be worthwhile finding out exactly how high rates were achieved and what barriers hindered lowest-performing councils? If this has already been carried out, it was not evident in the public domain during this research.

With some evidence of the council “stick” forcing positive behaviour change, I found virtually no large-scale evidence around how Brits overall (let alone different demographic groups) actually behave when it comes to recycling at home and on the go. It begs the £7.2bn question (the estimated total cost of the all-in DRS model): if DRS vending machines were introduced, would people actually use them?

Recent emotive public sentiment around climate change and plastic would indicate that people do care (again, scaled evidence is lacking) but that they are confused about how/what to recycle. In WRAP’s 2018 Recycling Tracker Survey around 34% of householders cited confusion over what can be recycled as the reason for inaction. I, for one, am unable to remember the last time my council sent a flyer or email to list what’s “in” and what’s “out” when it comes to bins.

With more funding, perhaps local authorities could invest in creative marketing campaigns that connect residents with the value in their own waste – for example by illustrating how food waste is composting local parks or how plastic cartons are powering low-income homes. The ultimate message would be to link household recycling with council-tax savings (enabled via local authority recyclate income).

My point is this: without a magic money tree and in an environment where the new “normal” is economic uncertainty, let’s bring UK corporations, small businesses, NGOs and consumer groups together in the next phase of these consultations to examine precedents and hard consumer research data; and to properly model cost/benefit calculations for the entire lifecycle of (at least a few key) materials.

If we can then set those findings against trajectories that extend beyond 15 years or more (akin to the UK’s industrial strategy and the National Infrastructure Audit Committee’s objectives), committing hard cash for local authorities to enable real behaviour changes, then we might start setting the wheel in motion for a smart, circular UK economy – without reinventing it.",Ireland,2019.06
77,Estée Lauder to develop refillable packaging as part of circular economy drive,"Estée Lauder to develop refillable packaging as part of circular economy drive

US-based cosmetics giant Estée Lauder has vowed to develop reusable and refillable packaging by 2025, as part of a sweeping new set of resource efficiency commitments.

The company, which owns brands such as MAC, Too Faced, SmashBox and Jo Malone London, this week joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s CE100 initiative – a cross-industry collaboration aimed at accelerating the transition to a circular economy.

Companies which join CE100 are given the chance to collaborate with competitors, governments, local authorities, academics and innovators to accelerate the transition to an economy that is “restorative and regenerative by design” through a series of workshops and events. They are also granted access to a digital portfolio of learning materials on circular economy principles.

As a CE100 member, Estée Lauder has pledged to make sure that at least 75% of its packaging portfolio is recyclable, refillable, reusable, recycled or recoverable by the end of 2025.

To meet this ambition, its team of packaging designers and material engineers will re-design the majority of its packaging portfolio, switching items currently made from fossil-fuel-based polymers with pulp or bio-based alternatives.

Where this is not possible, recycled content will be used, with Estée Lauder having set an additional target for increasing post-consumer recycled (PCR) content across its plastics portfolio by up to 50% by the end of 2025.

The company already PCR content in its Aveda skincare range and to make bottles and jars across the Aveda hairstyling portfolio. Of these lines, more than 85% contain 100% PCR material.

Estée Lauder is already a member of two cross-industry partnerships for more circular packaging, namely the Sustainable Packaging Coalition (SPC) and the Sustainable Packaging Initiative for CosmEtics (SPICE). The firm’s senior vice president for global corporate citizenship and sustainability Nancy Mahon said that by joining CE100, the company will have a broader opportunity to collaborate in a pre-competitive manner of sustainable packaging innovation.

“As a global company, employer and corporate citizen, The Estée Lauder Companies is committed to taking positive actions to ensure a healthier planet for all,” Mahon said.

“Driving circularity through sustainable packaging innovation is a priority for us and we believe a collaborative cross-industry approach is key to making meaningful progress.”

The global cosmetics and toiletries sector has been estimated to produce 120 billion units of plastic packaging every year by think tanks, with many of these items either classed as “non-recyclable” in kerbside collections in developed nations or sold in the developing regions where recycling infrastructure is either sparse or non-existent.

Estée Lauder is therefore just one of several companies in the sector to have bolstered its commitments around circular packaging in recent times, with many of these firms now turning to refill and reuse amid increased concerns around the ethics and environmental credentials of the global recycling industry from policymakers and the public alike.

In January, 24 consumer goods and food and drinks firms revealed that they would support TerraCycle's ""Loop"" platform, for example, whereby businesses will provide product refills while retaining ownership of their reusable packaging. Early supporters of the platform's initial launch in New York and Paris include Unilever, Procter & Gamble (P&G) and Colgate Palmolive, with Tesco set to spearhead a UK launch this autumn.

Away from Loop, P&G has also started offering refillable products through its Olay brand, which this week confirmed it will trial refillable pods for its Regenerist Whip moisturiser across its UK and US markets in October. Once the three-month trial is complete, P&G is hoping to replicate the model across other products in its brand portfolios.",Ireland,2019.06
82,"More investment needed in US chemical recycling technology to achieve circular economy, finds Wood Mackenzie","A recent push for more investment in chemical recycling in the US would allow recycled material to return to the value chain at the same level form which it started.

However, according to Wood Mackenzie Chemicals, there needs to be multi-pronged investment efforts to improve comprehensive collection, sorting, and recycle process technology in order to achieve a circular economy.

Shruthi Vangipuram, Wood Mackenzie Chemicals research analyst, said: “The circular economy is now a buzzword driving public policy agendas and corporate strategy groups.”

“With increased consumer awareness and the reality of more stringent political regulation around the corner, manufacturers, brands, and retailers are all pushing for innovation in recycled plastics.”

“A number of large corporates have already made public commitments to diversify away from single-use plastics in the coming years. Additionally, Styrofoam bans have been gaining increasing media attention over the past couple of years as states, cities, and municipalities are making it a key component of their sustainability and environmental policy.”

According to Wood Mackenzie Chemicals, the polystyrene industry is relatively small, at approximately 15 million tonnes of consumption, compared to other polymers such as polypropylene, at 75 million tonnes, and polyethylene, at 100 million tonnes.

Unlike polystyrene, polyethylene and polypropylene markets show robust growth rates of three to four per cent per annum.

Vangipuram said: “While opting to ban a material does propel manufacturers and consumers to actively think of alternatives, simply banning polystyrene will have minimal impact.”

“This is due to its small market share and also because the substitute product may, in fact, be worse for the environment.”

“Take for example a paper cup. While paper is recyclable, the paper cup is coated on the inside with low-density polyethylene. As such, combining paper with plastic does improve its functional properties, however it does make it incredibly difficult to recycle.”

“With this in mind, bans and polymer substitutions aren’t the ideal solution to achieve circular economy targets on the zero-waste goal.”

“Historically, the issue with recycled products has been the fact that they, more often than not, come back at a lower value than their original use, which has significant implications for applications such as food packaging.”

“While chemical recycling has been suggested as a way to combat this issue, accessibility of such chemical technology is extremely limited and is still in its early stages.”",United Kingdom,2019.06

• With growing consumer demand for more sustainable products and services, organisations of all shapes and sizes are set to get involved with London’s Circular Economy Week from 10-14 June
• 25 and counting events are already confirmed during the week
• The UK’s market for ethical products grew by more than £40bn between 2008 – 2017, and the circular economy could provide London with net benefits of £7bn every year

Businesses, government and NGOs from across the capital and beyond are taking part in the second annual Circular Economy Week from 10 – 14 June, to help drive a resource-efficient and sustainable economy.

The week, led by the London Waste and Recycling Board’s Circular London programme, will involve events, workshops, tours and a whole range of collaboration opportunities to explore more sustainable approaches to resource management, product design, manufacturing and retail. Events listed so far include:
• A UK cities roundtable hosted by LWARB and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation;
• Events on sustainable packaging and plastics alternatives, hosted by Future Planet and UCL;
• A clothes ‘swap shop’ and film screening from sustainable fashion campaign #LoveNotLandfill;
• Business in the Community webinar on the circular office and how to make working spaces more sustainable;
• TechWest event on low carbon innovation and technology’s role in circular economy;
• A tour of Premier Sustain’s re-manufactured furniture facility, The Renew Centre; and
• A tour of circular businesses along the Circle Line, run by Circle Economy Club London.

The past year has seen a rapidly growing appetite for action on the circular economy, and this year’s events will build on the success of the first ever Circular Economy Week last year. More than 85 companies have signed up to support the UK Plastics Pact in the past year, a collaboration bringing together businesses to help change the way we manage plastics. There is also growing global interest in the topic, with New York having recently hosted its own Circular City Week.

The transition to a circular economy could have hugely positive environmental impacts, with London potentially achieving a 60% reduction in its waste. and London is home to some of the most exciting developments in the circular economy, which is much more efficient than the traditional linear model in which we make, use and dispose of resources.

By 2036, the circular economy could provide London with net benefits of £7bn every year in the sectors of built environment, food, textiles, electricals and plastics, as well as creating 40,000 new jobs in re-use, remanufacturing and materials innovation.

Wayne Hubbard, Chief Executive at London Waste and Recycling Board (LWARB), said:

“Not only does the circular economy benefit the environment, it also offers real commercial advantages by allowing organisations to respond to consumer demand for more sustainable products and services. The circular economy can also create efficiencies as well as new revenue streams, markets and product lines – all increasingly important in this time of economic uncertainty.”

“London is a great global city, and one of the most vibrant business hubs in the world, so our Circular Economy Week is the perfect forum to collaborate, celebrate progress and share learning amongst organisations of all shapes and sizes. Cities are the engine room of the circular economy, and the capital is leading the way.”

With growing consumer demand for more sustainable products, Circular London is calling on businesses, public sector and other organisations to ensure they don’t get left behind. Nearly 90% of consumers strongly believe that society should be more resource-efficient, and the UK’s market for ethical products and services grew by more than £40bn between 2008-2017.

86,Five for Friday: World Circular Economy Forum,"With the current usage of plastics, by 2050 the world’s oceans will contain more plastic than fish. Hence, circularity and sustainable solutions cannot go overlooked if we humans don’t want to end up swimming in deep water in the near future.

In 2017, the Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra hosted the first World Circular Economy Forum. This year, when the forum returned to Helsinki, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland and our very own Finnfacts and invited journalists from Southeast Asia to attend and learn how Finnish companies and organisations are keeping the world spinning in the right direction.

According to Sitra’s Ernesto Hartikainen, circular economy and sustainable solutions should not be seen only as means to save the planet but also as business cases that can help Finns gain competitive edge in untapped markets.

Here are some Finnish solutions that tackle the challenges.

With the mission of saving the world from plastic waste, the people at Sulapac have created a patented, biodegradable and microplastic-free material that has all the benefits of conventional plastic without taking a toll on the environment.

“There are 500 million plastic straws used in America every single day and the number for Europe combined with Russia is 800 million,” said CTO Panu Hendolin.

The latest innovation from Sulapac is a marine-degradable, mass-producible straw that helps keep fish swimming. The straw has been created in collaboration with fellow Finns Stora Enso and is set to be released during the second quarter of 2019.

This company is definitely not going out of fashion with its technology that threads the needle for sustainable cotton, allowing the textile to be used again and again while preserving 100 per cent of its quality.

According to CEO Petri Alava, the time for action is now: “Fashion is the second-most polluting industry globally and getting worse. We have a solution brands love and a world-class team that get it done.”

Infinited Fiber is a young startup with a mature core and over 100 years of combined experience in the global fibre industry. The forever youthful company has already worked alongside world-renowned big guns in fashion such as Adidas, H&M, Tommy Hilfiger and Wrangler.

Cleaning up cities with smart solutions. The team at Smart & Clean Foundation has taken on the responsibility to orchestrate and facilitate coalitions that together can create and develop permanent sustainable solutions for society.

The new governmental policy programme and Finland’s ambitious pledge to become carbon neutral by 2035 are not making the foundation’s lips tremble. In fact, it is welcoming them with open arms.

“Our goal is to become the window for global climate solutions by 2021,” asserted CEO Tiina Kähö.

One of the foundation’s latest initiatives involves creating a closed circle for plastics in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area and Lahti. All Smart & Clean partners have already committed to the project.

The world’s third-most sustainable company and the highest-ranked energy company on the Global 100 list is the leading producer of 100 per cent renewable diesel. The renewable fuels produced by Neste in 2018 reduced carbon emissions by 7.9 million tonnes, which equals removing three million cars from the roads for a full year.

Petri Lehmus, vice president of R&D, outlined the company’s ambition to help its customers reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 million tonnes every year by 2030: “We believe that climate change defines the future of the energy sector and that circular economy is the vehicle for sustainable growth, which is why we are committed to creating a healthier planet for our children by delivering cleaner fuels to the roads.”

Food waste or unutilised resources? The people working at Restaurant Loop are producing delicious meals from locally sourced excess ingredients, which they receive from local merchants and producers.

With its operations, the Helsinki-based non-profit wants to help reduce carbon emissions caused by the food industry.

“If food waste was a country, it would be the third-largest nation in the world. We at Loop feel like we must make sure, not only through education, but also through concrete actions, that the food waste nation diminishes,” Mirka Korkia-aho, operational manager, outlined.

94,New asphalt which uses recycled waste tyres launched,"Construction solutions firm Tarmac has developed new asphalt technology that enables recycling end-of-life tyres (ELTs) and uses them to build roads.

With 40 million waste tyres produced annually in the UK, the company has created this innovative asphalt mix using granulated rubber.

Tarmac has said it estimates that it will be possible to recycle and reuse up to 750 waste tyres for every kilometre of highway surfaced with the new material, depending on the thickness of the road.

The Recycling Event will have a dedicated Design for Lifecycle Theatre, with speakers including TerraCycle, WRAP, Waitrose & more. Find out about this vital event now: https://www.therecyclingevent.com/

This would help to reduce the 120,000 tonnes of rubber waste exported from the UK each year, said the firm.

The initiative is part of Tarmac’s commitment to the circular economy, with the business recycling 8.7 million tonnes of waste from other sectors every year, and also builds on the company’s reuse of waste tyres to power its cement kilns.

Tarmac technical director Brian Kent said: “While plastic recycling has attracted media headlines, used tyres remain a significant and overlooked waste stream and our new innovative rubber modified asphalts offer a more sustainable option for our industry and the environment.

“Rubber is used in asphalt across the USA, but in the UK there is a lack of the necessary industrial infrastructure required to allow manufacture of this type of material. Against the backdrop of major investment in the strategic road network there is now an opportunity to leverage this technology and unlock the benefits of this circular economic approach.”

As part of recent trials of the new material, Tarmac supplied asphalt with rubber in Coventry.

Coventry City Council highways technical senior engineer Rob Little said: “Coventry City Council is delighted with the rubberised asphalt trial. We hope we can use more of the product across the city in the future to help divert waste tyres from landfill and incineration to reduce the carbon footprint for road construction projects in Coventry. We are proud to be leading with our partners, Balfour Beatty and Tarmac in providing road surfaces which are providing significant environmental benefits for our communities.”

There is also significant scope to recycle and reduce the UK’s dependence on the export of ELT’s to other destinations.

Tyre Recovery Association secretary general Peter Taylor said: “While there has been significant progress in reusing and recycling waste tyres in the UK, there is still an over reliance on the export of used tyres to countries such as China, India and Pakistan, who are importing fewer tyres as they become self-sufficient. The UK needs a second disposal route for used tyres.

103,How the circular economy could save our planet | Lombard Odier,"We need to devote more than one day

5 June is World Environment Day. Some will think that our (only) planet deserves better than this one day of the year that we devote to it. They're not wrong: the scientific world is constantly alerting us to the worrying state of our shared home. Pollution affects all environments and contaminates soil, air and water. Plastic is now so omnipresent that it not only pollutes our beaches and forests, but also penetrates the entire food chain. It can be found in every corner of the planet and even in the deepest part of our oceans, as sadly discovered by members of a recent expedition who, for the first time, went 11,000 metres below sea level. Man has even begun to pollute space, leaving a vast quantity of waste in orbit that cannot be disposed of.

Man has even begun to pollute space, leaving a vast quantity of waste in orbit that cannot be disposed of.

Biodiversity isn’t faring well either. Virtually all wildlife species have seen their populations decline massively (on average 40%) over the past 20 years, a frighteningly short time. None of the massive extinction phases that the earth has experienced to date have been accompanied by such rapid and widespread destruction of life. Today, humans and the livestock they raise for their own needs represent 96% of all land animals. Wildlife has been reduced to just 4% of living beings, and these populations are also suffering from a dramatic decrease in their habitats, breeding grounds and food sources.

None of the massive extinction phases that the Earth has experienced to date have accompanied by such rapid and widespread destruction of life.

Ultimately, climate change exacerbates all these problems and further disrupts the fragile balance that is already under enormous pressure. And despite COP21 and the Paris agreements, this trend has not yet been reversed. To make things worse, global CO2 emissions picked up again in 2018.

Human beings, who are largely responsible for this situation, are finally beginning to understand that they are also victims. This is not just about saving polar bears or orang-utans. The damage to our environment is such that it now directly threatens our health, food security, economic development and, consequently, the very stability of our political systems.

So how can we reverse this trend at a time when global demographics and the economy continue to grow? A simple calculation shows that 3% global growth per year, which is more or less the trajectory we have been on since 2000, implies a doubling of our production in 25 years. How can we produce twice as much when we are already consuming far more resources than the planet is able to regenerate in one year?

How can we produce twice as much when we are already consuming far more resources than the planet is able to regenerate in one year?

For some, negative growth may seem to be the only rational way forward. It will undoubtedly be part of the solution. Sooner or later, we will have to break free from the ultra-consumerist model in which we have locked ourselves and relearn the virtues of being relatively frugal. And replace ""more is better"" with ""less is better"".

But there is another path that is more appealing than negative growth, a path that encourages innovation rather than recession. A path that involves completely rethinking our production model to decouple it completely (or as far as possible) from the extraction of new resources and production of waste. This model is well-known in the academic world and is already successfully practised today by pioneering companies that have shown that it is possible to rethink everything and produce differently.

This is known as the circular economy.

Behind this somewhat theoretical concept lies in fact a very concrete and profound transformation not only of our productive base, but also of the rationale of industrial production.

Sooner or later, we will have to break free from the ultra-consumerist model in which we have locked ourselves and relearn the virtues of being relatively frugal.

Indeed, the consumer society that has emerged over the past century has been built around an entirely linear principle: extract-manufacture-dispose. Then repeat. Waste – and the pollution it causes – is an inseparable by-product of this form of production.

Each European citizen uses 15 tonnes of materials each year and generates 4.5 tonnes of waste. Worldwide, 322 million tonnes of plastic, 240 million tonnes of paper and 59 million tonnes of aluminium is produced every year, the vast majority of which is not recycled and ends up in landfills or in nature. Overall, more than 65 billion tonnes of materials were produced in 2010, a figure that is expected to rise to 80 billion in 2020. This is much more than the planet can sustainably provide and absorb in return.





 Worldwide, 322 million tonnes of plastic, 240 million tonnes of paper and 59 million tonnes of aluminium is produced every year, the vast majority of which is not recycled and ends up in landfills or in nature.

The circular economy is based on a different logic: it aims to ensure that the natural resources used for the manufacturing of every product are fully recovered and re-injected into the economy without having to be extracted again. This involves several major changes:
• The notion of waste does not exist in the circular economy. Once the consumer good has reached the end of its life, the materials it contains are reused to build the same (or another) product again. Like nature, in which organic ""waste"" is actually the food that produces the next harvest.
• The circular economy is not just a question of recycling. It involves rethinking the design of the products themselves so that they can be dismantled and the different materials simply extracted once they reach the end of their life. Such ""eco-design"" currently generates a great deal of innovation and allows many companies to make substantial savings by reducing the number of components and assembly phases required. Adidas has created a sports shoe, the Parley, which is made of a single block of moulded plastic, that’s recast and remoulded to produce a new shoe.
• The circular economy also requires a rethinking of ownership models. The company must be made accountable for its product throughout its use cycle, thus it is responsible for collecting and recycling the products it has manufactured. The best way to do this is for the company to remain the owner of the property it sells us. The shoe you buy does not belong to you: you rent it for a given period of time. This system, which may seem surprising, actually has enormous benefits for the consumer and the planet. First, it helps establish an efficient recycling process, as the company has an economic interest in recovering the products it sells. It also guarantees quality and ensures there is no planned obsolescence. The company that sells you a dishwasher, for example, has every interest in making it work for as long as possible because in the event of a breakdown, it’s not you who will buy a new one, but the company that must replace it.

[The circular economy] aims to ensure that the natural resources used for the manufacturing of every product are fully recovered and re-injected into the economy without having to be extracted again.

In the end, this new type of economy represents a huge economic opportunity for most industrial companies at a time when security of supply and the cost of raw materials are weighing on their results and prospects. The economic value of metals contained in electronic waste, for example, is USD 55 billion per year. In Europe alone, the potential savings associated with circularity range from USD 380 billion to USD 630 billion per year, depending on the scenarios.

[…] this new type of economy represents a huge economic opportunity for most industrial companies at a time when security of supply and the cost of raw materials are weighing on their results and prospects

Of course, the circular economy will not solve everything. It is never possible to recover and reuse 100% of materials. Nor does the circular economy fully resolve the issue of energy consumption, even if it eliminates a large part of the needs upstream of the production chain. But it holds the very concrete promise of a significant decoupling of production from the exploitation of natural resources. It means a world can be envisaged where 10 billion people can continue to eat, travel, live, support themselves, work and play without their development being at the expense of the environment on which we all depend so intimately.

[The circular economy] holds the very concrete promise of a significant decoupling of production from the exploitation of natural resources.

Nature is the best example of a circular economy. The wisdom of millions of years of evolution shows us the way forward. It's time we listened to it.

105,Circular economy could boost London's economy by £7bn a year,"Businesses, government and NGOs from across London will take part in the second annual Circular Economy Week from 10 – 14 June, to help drive a resource-efficient and sustainable practices which organisers say could boost the capital’s economy by £7bn a year.

The week, led by the London Waste and Recycling Board’s Circular London programme, will involve events, workshops, tours and a range of collaboration opportunities to explore more sustainable approaches to resource management, product design, manufacturing and retail.

Events listed so far include a UK cities roundtable hosted by LWARB and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation; a clothes ‘swap shop’ and film screening from sustainable fashion campaign #LoveNotLandfill and a tour of circular businesses along the Circle Line, run by Circle Economy Club London.

Wayne Hubbard, chief executive at London Waste and Recycling Board (LWARB), said: ‘Not only does the circular economy benefit the environment, but it also offers real commercial advantages by allowing organisations to respond to consumer demand for more sustainable products and services.

‘The circular economy can also create efficiencies as well as new revenue streams, markets and product lines – all increasingly important in this time of economic uncertainty.’

Organisers say the transition to a circular economy could have hugely positive environmental impacts for the capital. By 2036, the circular economy could provide London with net benefits of £7bn every year in the sectors of the built environment, food, textiles, electricals and plastics, they claim, as well as creating 40,000 new jobs in re-use, remanufacturing and materials innovation.

Shirley Rodrigues, London’s Deputy Mayor for Environment and Energy, said: ‘Our economy is currently geared towards using resources in a way that is inefficient and unsustainable.

‘The Mayor wants to accelerate London’s transition to a low-carbon circular economy by planning for materials to be kept in use for as long as possible and promoting business models which support this.

‘Circular Economy Week will help raise the profile of this important issue and encourage people across London to support the transition to a circular economy.’

106,WCEF2019 speakers: The EU needs to show global leadership on the circular economy,"The World Circular Economy Forum 2019 took place in Helsinki on 3-5 June, and seemingly presented “the most advanced circular economy solutions” for governments, industries, businesses and citizens – and “put pressure on the EU to strengthen [its] lead.” There is a need to fix our unsustainable economic system, speakers explained. Governments should collaborate and create predictable policies for business to able to transform to a circular model.

The third annual Forum brought together over 2200 business leaders, policymakers, researchers and innovators. Its goal was to move the circular economy into the next era and transform a “best kept secret” into something with global impact.

“The science is screaming at us: our current growth pattern is unsustainable,” said Laura Tuck, Vice President for Sustainable Development at the World Bank. “We need to change our policies which gives incentives for the overuse of resources. We must also value our natural capital such as air, land and water. The cost of depleting our natural capital must be properly accounted for.”

We are undergoing a climate crisis, but we have a solution in the circular economy, the event suggested. However, cooperation and global leadership is needed in order for it to be realised.

“For most countries their economies are too small to be self-sufficient in circularity. In order to have full circularity there’s a need for co-operation across borders,” said Elliot Harris, UN Assistant Secretary General and Chief Economist. “For that to happen, there needs to be global consensus and understanding that we want to create the circular economy with each other, not separate from each other.”

Perspective on Finland’s forthcoming EU Presidency period

 Eight European countries recently called for the European Union to spend a quarter of its budget on tackling climate change. This gives a sense of how serious the EU takes the issue, said a WCEF press release. The EU shows global leadership on the circular economy by implementing policies and ensuring funds to develop and scale up solutions. Finland will assume the Presidency of the EU Council on 1 July 2019.

“Europe wants to lead, and there is strong public support from EU citizens,” said Karmenu Vella, European Commissioner for the Environment, Fisheries and Maritime Affairs.

In recent years there has been a movement towards isolationism and renewed trade barriers. This is anathema to the openness and cooperation needed to advance circular solutions to combat climate change.

Europe shows global leadership on the circular economy by ensuring its top-level importance in governance and financial resourcing in the European Commission. Furthermore, the circular economy is an opportunity for greater fairness.

“The full transition to the circular economy will require large-scale investments, especially in the developing regions around the world,” said Mikko Kosonen, President of Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra.

Finland set out “the world’s most climate-ambitious government programme”

 Finland’s new government programme – with its focus on climate action, fighting inequality and moving towards the circular economy – was released during the event. The ambitious agenda was said to be an example of a predictable policy framework that makes it easier for business to adapt.

What was described as the world’s first national road map to a circular economy was published in 2016 under guidance from Sitra, the Finnish innovation fund, said the organisers.

The WCEF is the global initiative of the Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra. The WCEF2019 was hosted by Sitra and co-organised with selected international partners. Next year WCEF2020 will be held in Canada.

“We all know we have too much waste – it’s piling up in landfills, and ending up in our environment,” said Catherine McKenna, Canada’s Minister of Environment and Climate Change. “Canada is looking forward to welcoming WCEF 2020 delegates to North America, to expand circular economy networks, partnerships and opportunities. By working together we can find ways to recycle and reuse our resources and create great jobs. Let’s work together and turn that trash to cash.”

“We want to leave a strong economy and a clean environment for our children. Canadian companies are at the forefront of clean technology globally and many of our homegrown innovations involve zero waste. Cleantech and zero waste are the next wave of innovation, supporting our economy and creating good jobs, while protecting our environment,” said Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development.

114,TOMRA offers a circular solution to the world’s plastic problem,"In recent years, there has been a huge shift in attitudes towards waste and recycling, with new regulations and targets being set by policymakers and governments alike. At the heart of these discussions is the need to create a circular economy – one that ensures countries handle resources in a sustainable and effective way. This is particularly true of plastic, which, despite being the workhorse of the global economy, is often produced and disposed of unsustainably.

The sheer amount of plastic used around the world each year is staggering: since plastic production entered the mainstream in the 1950s, more than 8.3 billion tonnes have been produced, 6.3 billion tonnes of which is now regarded as plastic waste. According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, only 14 percent of plastic is recycled globally. By comparison, the global recycling rate for paper is 58 percent, while 70 to 90 percent of iron and steel is reprocessed. Clearly, plastic is by far the most problematic material in circulation; if the current trend continues, there will be 12 billion tonnes of plastic waste in our landfills and ecosystems by 2050.

A load of rubbish

 The past 40 years have seen our unsustainable linear economic model – take, make, dispose – accelerate at an alarming rate, with approximately one million plastic bottles now bought every minute. To put this into context, more than 800,000 of these will be incinerated, disposed of in landfills or lost into the natural environment. In other words, plastic packaging has become a key driver of our waste crisis.

Today, the battle against plastic waste is taking place on a global scale, with new regulations demanding that governments and policymakers reassess their approach to handling refuse. Recent import bans in China, Malaysia and Thailand, for example, have left waste-exporting countries sitting on a lot of plastic. As a result, these states are now being forced to look at their own recycling infrastructures in order to find sustainable solutions to their domestic waste management problems.

By adopting a circular model, it will become possible for such countries to collect and recycle plastics on a large scale and to a high standard, creating a closed loop that has positive environmental impacts, such as reducing carbon emissions and limiting the production of virgin materials. Fortunately, policymakers, industry leaders and technology providers are beginning to wake up to this fact.

Finding value in waste

 There isn’t just one simple solution to creating a truly circular economy. Instead, a number of factors need to work in harmony to ensure the idea of reducing plastic waste is promoted effectively and efficiently. To achieve this, consumers, brand owners and manufacturers must all play their part.

At TOMRA, we believe the implementation of a deposit return scheme (DRS) is an effective way of encouraging consumers to recycle their plastic drinks containers and keep materials within the closed loop. These schemes see consumers pay a fixed deposit that is refunded when a bottle has been returned for recycling. As well as motivating consumers to take the plastic container back to be recycled, the financial incentive helps to communicate the message that plastic has value and should be treated as a resource, rather than a disposable piece of waste.

What’s more, a DRS makes it easier to collect high-quality plastics through a reverse vending machine, which separates the contents to reduce the risk of contamination – an important consideration when maintaining food-grade standards. Many industries have been working hard to develop this holistic process in a bid to remove plastic from mixed-waste streams, reduce our reliance on downcycling and replace virgin plastics. Globally, around 40 markets have adopted DRS to date, experiencing return rates of up to 98 percent.

Tackling plastic refuse at the waste and recycling-plant stage is also a key step to accomplishing a circular economy. Thanks to a number of technological developments, sorting machines within waste/recycling plants can detect and recover plastics that have been incorrectly disposed of. This ensures more plastic is kept in the circular economy and out of the environment. Sensor-based sorting machines, for example, present an efficient, economically viable and reliable way of recovering a valuable resource and allowing it to be reused for other purposes.

The range of everyday plastic products that can become mixed up with general waste is huge, so being able to detect, recover and recycle them is a sustainable step towards achieving a closed loop. Brand owners must also start advocating the use of recycled goods and be willing to purchase recycled plastics. This, in turn, will showcase to manufacturers that there is a demand for recyclable goods.

Today, 11 leading brands, retailers and packaging companies are aiming to provide 100 percent reusable, recyclable or compostable packaging by 2025. If successful, this would mean a move away from downcycling plastics, as well as the creation of a high-quality material that meets all necessary regulations.

Closing the loop

 The facts surrounding waste do not lie – we need to take action on a global scale to improve how we manage plastic. Progressive schemes should be set up to allow consumers, policymakers and brand owners to adopt the mindset that plastic is not disposable, but is instead a valuable resource. Through instilling and promoting this ideology, a circular economy for plastics can be developed, ensuring products and packaging are recycled in a sustainable, energy-efficient and cost-effective manner.

If we are to take meaningful strides towards achieving global sustainability targets, we must consider the benefits of a circular economy and increase the use of post-consumer plastics within product manufacturing and packaging. We’ve already witnessed improvements in the fast-moving consumer goods market, but debates around quality, cost and cleanliness rumble on. Clearly, more work needs to be done.

At TOMRA, our vision is to lead the resource revolution. We are dedicated to improving the recycling rates of plastic and many other materials, and have been developing solutions since 1972 to support the circular economy. This year, we will build on this commitment through our Circular Economy Unit, a team devoted to supporting the circular economy, protecting the environment and encouraging sustainable practices in relation to resource productivity. By working together, we can solve our planet’s waste crisis.",United Kingdom,2019.06
115,"CONFERENCE: “Plastics are the Future, but Not Plastic Waste…”","Opening the TOMRA Leads conference on plastic waste in Sofia, Bulgaria this morning, Tom Eng, TOMRA Senior Vice President and Head of TOMRA Sorting Solutions, Recycling told delegates that “Plastics are the Future, but Not Plastic Waste”.

Explaining the need for a shift towards a more circular economy for plastics, he went on to quote George Bernard Shaw: “progress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything”.

Coinciding with World Environment Day, the event will look at all aspects of the plastics value chain, as well as the pros and cons of various collection systems, deposit return schemes and manufacturer initiatives.

Later in the morning, making his keynote speech, Dr Volker Rehrmann, Head of Business Area Sorting Solutions, noted a seachange in attitudes to plastics and the need to create a much more circular value chain. Spurred on by initiatives such as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s New Plastics Economy, many major brands across the value chain are starting to come together.

“No one would ever have believed that our EU government could come up with quite such impressive targets, together with a new way of measuring them… Now is the time to do it, but we need to take a holistic approach,” he said. “But we need to collaborate, we need to do it together.

“Design for recyclability is so important,” Rehrmann told delegates. “Design has never been high on the agenda. Design for cost and design for aesthetics, yes. But not for recyclability, and this is how we’ve ended up with a lot of problems - but it’s changing.”

He also urged more thought to be given to reuse for plastics to be tackled. “Sometimes it doesn’t make sense from a CO2 perspective, but sometimes it makes a lot of sense. We have to have it on the agenda, plastics are very durable materials…”

The Inconvenient Truth

 Using some approximated numbers to update a 2013 Ellen MacArthur foundation diagram on material flows for plastic packaging, Rehrmann highlighted the fact that around 30 million tonnes of plastic waste are still leaking into the environment, 40 million tonnes being landfilled, 14 million tonnes incinerated – only 14 million tonnes are collected for recycling.

Moreover, of the 14 million tonnes collected, 4 million tonnes are lost in the recycling process and 8.5 million tonnes are ‘downcycled’. That leaves just 2.5 million tonnes being recycled in a closed loop.

“Think about it,” he urged. “After 20 years of effort we have all put into this - it’s an inconvenient truth. But how are we going to change that? First of all we need to collect more plastics and bring it into the recycling stream…. A big problem is leakage, and really most of that comes from South East Asia and Africa. We need to focus on those areas where there is no proper collection system. We can achieve a lot there.”

“In the west, we could put some sorting equipment in front of landfill and incineration,” he continued. “We have some projects now where we’re working with a number of incineration plants. It takes a change of mindset – there will always be some residual waste, but we can recover much more – there is no technical innovation needed.”

“Take this message with you,” said Rehrmann. “It is not a problem to recover plastics from waste that is going to landfill. It can be done. But you need to bring it to a quality where it can replace virgin material, otherwise it is not helping create a circular economy for plastics.”

“We need a new mindset in the recycling industry – quality quality quality. If we don’t achieve that we will fail. If recycled material keeps a reputation for inferior quality we will fail,” he concluded.

116,The circular economy: Four million business models and counting | ESCP,"While many ideas for the design of business models for the circular economy have been put forward, providing a comprehensive overview of them always proves to be difficult because of the sheer volume of case studies and theories out there.

This is what Prof. Dr. Florian Lüdeke-Freund and his colleagues aimed to solve with their research where they explored the variety of circular economy business models in an April 2018 article in the Journal of Industrial Ecology (freely available through 2019) and found 26 major business model types, including for example “remanufacturing”, “waste exchange”, and “product-as-a-service”. These business model types reveal a lot about the numerous design options for the development of circular economy business models.

Researchers and supply chain managers, business and product developers, innovation managers, and other practitioners working to make their businesses more sustainable can benefit from this research. An astonishing variety of design options were found, including numerous value propositions, customer relationships, or supply chain approaches to close material and energy flows. Theoretically speaking, this variety allows for the development of more than 4 million different business model designs for the circular economy... news article continued here on ""The Conversation"".",European Union,2019.06
118,Closing speech of Mari Pantsar from in the World Circular Economy Forum 2019,"Mari Pantsar, the Director of Sitra, held the closing speech in the World Circular Economy Forum on 4 June 2019 in Finlandia hall.

What an incredible two days it has been!

My warmest thank you – our distinguished key-partners, our forum partners, our speakers and participants and our facilitators.

And, of course, the amazing Sitra team that once again made this all happen.

During the last two days we have had the chance to see old friends, meet new people and discuss the best ways to advance the circular economy globally. These encounters have been extremely valuable and critically important due to the great challenge we are facing.

This great challenge is that our world is encountering a deep, global sustainability crisis including three dimensions:

In order to solve the climate crisis, global carbon dioxide emissions must be halved in 10 years. After 30 years, we must have achieved negative carbon dioxide emissions to keep global warming below the critical 1.5 degrees.

With the biodiversity crisis we have even less time to act.

Our economic model today is deeply dependant on unsustainable use of natural resources.

According to the United Nations the extraction and processing of natural resources causes half of global air emissions, and 80 to 90 percent of biodiversity loss. Still only 9 percent of materials remain in circulation.

To counter this, the circular economy is the most powerful solution. We simply must make better use of materials that already exist in our societies instead of extracting more and more natural resources – which in turn causes more and more air emissions and kills off more and more species.

We must be better in adopting the circular economy tools and technologies to solve this challenge. They do already exist.

There are many good things happening around the world as we have heard during the Forum, but we are running against the clock. If we don’t run faster, we will lose the race.

We must reinvent our understanding of well-being and learn to appreciate nature once again.

Dear Friends, before humans used to see nature as a partner, and many indigenous peoples still do. Now we see nature as a resource that can be infinitely exploited and discarded after use.

Mankind is playing a kind of Jenga-game with nature. In Jenga the players take turns removing one block at a time from a tower constructed of wooden blocks. The game ends when the whole tower falls.

We, people, are continually taking blocks from nature and being pleased that the structure did not collapse during our turn.

But at some point, the final block will eventually be removed and the whole structure will fall.

We cannot let this happen.

This needs to change.

Every time we make a decision, we should evaluate what it means for nature and future generations. According to the “Great Law of Peace” constitution of the Iroquois people of North America, the effects of decisions must be evaluated for the next seven generations.

If a decision is made to use a river for fishing, what about the seventh generation of the community? What does the decision mean in terms of fish for them?

We should learn from the Iroquois people. Ensuring that the next seven generations will live on a planet that is not several degrees hotter and tormented by wildfires, hurricanes and droughts, means we must make the correct decisions today.

And we all have a role to play. We can adjust the way we get from one place to another, what kind of houses we live in and what we eat. We can ensure our governments have the long-term perspective in mind and elect responsible and ambitious leaders. And we can support businesses that offer circular solutions by buying their products and services creating employment and sources of income for the next seven generations.

Together we have the power to scale up the circular economy globally. And this gives us hope!

I am confident we can win this race.

I am most confident because of all of you, who have been working hard to make circular economy a reality all around the world.

We are about to close our event in Helsinki, but as was announced, the WCEF story continues and the fourth World Circular Economy Forum will be organized across the Oceans in Canada. I sincerely hope we will meet there next year.

Thank you very much!",Finland,2019.06
119,Canada will host the World Circular Economy Forum 2020,"Next year the WCEF is going to Canada, where participants will learn how Canada’s unique circular solutions are making a global impact.

“WCEF is going to Canada because of the strong commitment from the government of Canada and leading enterprises for the circular economy,” says Mari Pantsar, Sitra’s Director for the Carbon-neutral economy. “Sitra has been working closely with the Circular Economy Leadership Coalition since it was established. WCEF has been held twice in Europe and once in Asia, so going to North America is a natural next step.”

Canada is a large and diverse country, including major urban centres, isolated villages and indigenous communities. Organisers have a circular economy vision that is just, inclusive and works for everyone.

“The circular economy has momentum in Canada,” says Leah Canning, Senior Policy Advisor at the Environment and Climate Change ministry. “We are excited to showcase Canadian innovations as well as learn from our partners.”

Environment and Climate Change Canada is the host organisation within the Government of Canada for WCEF 2020, working with partners such as Sitra and the Circular Economy Leadership Coalition.

Canada has a highly educated, skilled and creative workforce who are increasingly concerned with protecting the environment. This is fertile ground for great circular initiatives to develop.

“It is an exciting time for the circular economy in Canada,” says Heather Schoemaker, Director of the National Zero Waste Council Secretariat, an initiative of Metro Vancouver. “We see accelerated action across the economy from a variety of stakeholders. There is strong leadership and a network of champions, as well as many pioneer projects that will offer insights to others just getting started.”

Every region has its own unique challenges in transitioning to a circular economy. For example, the Canadian federal system gives the provinces and territories jurisdiction over a range of issues.

“This means that policy making is a system of collaboration and engagement,” explains Canning. “We rarely have a policy which is implemented solely top-down. Instead, we use cooperation.”

These co-creation efforts also work on the small, local level. Canning points to a partnership between the City of Guelph and Wellington County, Ontario, who together won a smart city prize for their plan to build a technology-enabled Circular Food Economy.

Canadian businesses and cities have developed a number of good circular solutions. These range from small, local initiatives to nationwide endeavours.

“We have zero waste grocery stores popping up around the country, such as NADA in Vancouver,” Schoemaker says. “There is a growth of local repair, reuse and sharing models and initiatives, like the Metro Vancouver Share, Repair Reuse network and Toronto Tool Library, which expanded to become Canada’s first Library of Things. Large corporations like Walmart Canada and Ikea are making bold commitments on zero plastic waste and the circular economy. Many new businesses are making new products out of what was once waste materials, like ChopValue, a company collecting chopsticks and transforming them into new durable furniture and installations.”

Canada has also led the way in major global initiatives. When Canada held the presidency of the G7 group of nations they introduced the ocean plastics charter which addresses the threat of marine litter and is already implementing it domestically.

Participants at WCEF 2020 will have an opportunity to share their own solutions as well as learn about Canada’s unique skills and approach to the circular economy.

“Canada has strengths in particular industries, such as minerals and metals. For example, we have a company which developed a process to recover critical materials from lithium batteries,” Canning says. “This is one of the sectors which we hope to highlight next year.”

“While we face great planetary risks, the circular economy provides a bold vision and framework for action, and if we can harness our collective ingenuity, innovation and creativity, the possibilities for positive change are very real and tangible,” Schoemaker concludes. “We commend Sitra for providing the global platform through the WCEF and invite everyone to continue the conversation on 30-31 October in Vancouver, Canada at the Zero Waste Conference in advance of the 2020 WCEF in Canada.”",Finland,2019.06
120,More efficient recycling with the circular economy model,"More efficient recycling with the circular economy model

The appropriate sorting and recycling of waste is a natural part of Empower’s operations. For instance, all sites of Connectivity business collect construction waste generated on their construction sites and ensure, on behalf of our customer Telia, that waste is processed appropriately. The waste is delivered to Kuusakoski for recycling. Kuusakoski unloads the waste and waste volumes are reported by category to Empower and Telia.

The purpose of sorting is to increase waste recovery and reduce the negative environmental and health effects that would result if waste was disposed of inappropriately. Waste collected from the field and delivered to Kuusakoski includes waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), metals, wood materials, construction and cable waste and industrial batteries.

External and internal waste management requirements serve as a guideline in recycling.

– The key waste management requirements originate from the Waste Act and the Government Decree on Waste. In addition to them, Empower’s own instructions and our partners’ quality management systems control the realization of sustainability. A key principle for Empower is that waste will no longer be delivered to a landfill; instead, the aim is to recycle all waste generated by our operations, says Hannu Jaakkola, Account Manager at Empower.",European Union,2019.06
121,London’s circular economy week,"Businesses, government and NGOs from across the capital and beyond are taking part in the second annual Circular Economy Week from 10 June 2019, to help drive a resource-efficient and sustainable economy.

The week, led by the London Waste and Recycling Board’s Circular London programme, will involve events, workshops, tours and a whole range of collaboration opportunities to explore more sustainable approaches to resource management, product design, manufacturing and retail.
• A UK cities roundtable hosted by LWARB and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation;
• Events on sustainable packaging and plastics alternatives, hosted by Future Planet and UCL;
• A clothes ‘swap shop’ and film screening from sustainable fashion campaign #LoveNotLandfill;
• Business in the Community webinar on the circular office and how to make working spaces more sustainable;
• TechWest event on low carbon innovation and technology’s role in circular economy;
• A tour of Premier Sustain’s re-manufactured furniture facility, The Renew Centre; and
• A tour of circular businesses along the Circle Line, run by Circle Economy Club London.

The past year has seen a rapidly growing appetite for action on the circular economy, and this year’s events will build on the success of the first ever Circular Economy Week last year.

More than 85 companies have signed up to support the UK Plastics Pact in the past year, a collaboration bringing together businesses to help change the way we manage plastics. There is also growing global interest in the topic, with New York having recently hosted its own Circular City Week.

The transition to a circular economy could have hugely positive environmental impacts, with London potentially achieving a 60 percent reduction in its waste.

London is home to some of the most exciting developments in the circular economy, which is much more efficient than the traditional linear model in which we make, use and dispose of resources.

By 2036, the circular economy could provide London with net benefits of £7bn every year in the sectors of built environment, food, textiles, electricals and plastics, as well as creating 40,000 new jobs in re-use, remanufacturing and materials innovation.

Wayne Hubbard, chief executive at London Waste and Recycling Board (LWARB), said: “Not only does the circular economy benefit the environment, it also offers real commercial advantages by allowing organisations to respond to consumer demand for more sustainable products and services.

""The circular economy can also create efficiencies as well as new revenue streams, markets and product lines – all increasingly important in this time of economic uncertainty.”

“London is a great global city, and one of the most vibrant business hubs in the world, so our Circular Economy Week is the perfect forum to collaborate, celebrate progress and share learning amongst organisations of all shapes and sizes. Cities are the engine room of the circular economy, and the capital is leading the way.”

With growing consumer demand for more sustainable products, Circular London is calling on businesses, public sector and other organisations to ensure they don’t get left behind. Nearly 90 percent of consumers strongly believe that society should be more resource-efficient and the UK’s market for ethical products and services grew by more than £40bn between 2008-2017.

Almost half of those aged under 24 have avoided a product or service in the last year due to its negative environmental impact.

Shirley Rodrigues, London’s Deputy Mayor for Environment and Energy, said: “Our economy is currently geared towards using resources in a way that is inefficient and unsustainable.

""The Mayor wants to accelerate London’s transition to a low-carbon circular economy by planning for materials to be kept in use for as long as possible and promoting business models which support this.

""Circular Economy Week will help raise the profile of this important issue and encourage people across London to support the transition to a circular economy.”

124,Zero Waste Scotland launch new circular economy website,"A new website by Zero Waste Scotland (ZWS) has launched that will outline ways the country’s businesses can maximise opportunities in the circular economy and respond to the climate emergency.

The Circular Economy Accelerator will support the further development and introduction of circular economy business models across the country, providing an opportunity to open new income streams, reduce money spent on materials, and decrease the impact of businesses on the world.

This new website will provide tools that include advice manuals and access to support and funding, providing organisations with everything they require to identify where they can take a circular approach.

A report produced by ZWS found that adopting circular economy principles could help the Scottish economy by up to £3 billion.

ZWS chief executive Iain Gulland said: “As the growing climate emergency forces us all to reconsider our approaches to everyday living, Zero Waste Scotland has worked quickly to develop a hub that presents great opportunities and support for businesses to change the mindset on how they operate. This can reduce costs and generate new income streams, while attempting to address what is a global problem.

“There are a wide number of ways this can be achieved, such as creating new products from previously wasted materials or moving to leasing models where manufacturers can take back and refurbish existing products. Innovative methods can also design out waste from manufacturing processes. This is a way of operating that is going to grow in the years ahead and Scotland has the opportunity to be a leader on the international stage.”

Firms that are already making a success of the circular approach to business include Elite Contract Furniture and EGG Lighting.

Elite Contract Furniture provide a tailored furnishing service and is examining the design of its mattresses and the ways they can be recycled, as well as looking at building in an end-of-life use for its furniture that would prevent it from going to landfill.

EGG Lighting produce sensor-led intelligent lighting solutions and provide a circular design model where customers pay EGG for a smart, energy-saving light service. When a light needs to be repaired, instead of disposing it with the entire unit, EGG restocks the required part, and then takes the broken items away for repair.",United Kingdom,2019.06

126,Nordic coalition to accelerate the transition to a Circular Economy,"The coalition aims to establish a new platform that will increase knowledge sharing about circular economy business models between the Nordic markets, while exploring the opportunities for specific circular economy projects in the Nordics. The coalition is modelled from the best practices from Holland Circular Hotspot. Stakeholders and actors interested in joining the coalition are encouraged to get in touch.

According to Leidar the coalition will align goals and targets for the circular economy in the Nordics, building on existing efforts from each market and experience from similar companies in different sectors. The coalition will invite governments, cities and regions, companies and knowledge institutions to collaborate closely to explore practical and scalable solutions, applicable for SMEs and core industry, as well as exploring necessary policy incentives.

“The consumption in the Nordic countries continue to increase at an unsustainable rate. Each of the Nordic countries are small, but together it’s the 11th largest economy in the world. Collaborating for development of education exchange and information is the Nordic model. A Nordic Circular Hotspot initiative can speed up the necessary transition to a circular economy,” says Cathrine Barth, founder of Circular Norway and one of the initiators of Nordic Circular Hotspot.

“Today there is limited collaboration between the Nordic countries when it comes to concrete actions for a circular economy transition. We believe that collaboration between the Nordic countries is crucial for breaking out of the linear economy infrastructure in the region and moving towards a circular economy,” says Marthe Haugland at Nordic Innovation. Nordic Innovation are financing the pre-project for a Nordic Circular Hotspot.

“The trend towards circular material flows must move faster. The Business sector is often ahead of politics. Now, new financial incentives are needed to support new business models. Nordic cooperation is particularly important for pushing for circular economy reforms at EU level”, says Anders Wijkman, Chairman of Circular Sweden. “Most important will be to introduce criteria for circular design.”

Initiators of the coalition include Lifestyle and Design Cluster/National Circular Hub from Denmark; Cradlenet and RISE from Sweden; Business Finland from Finland and Circular Norway from Norway. Among other interested parties are; Sitra, The Association of the Swedish Recycling Industries and Circular Sweden.

“The Circular economy increases green innovation, export and employment, reduces resource use and limits different kinds of pollution, including CO2 emissions. The Nordic cooperation will help exchange ideas and focus on this important new way of doing business and address global common opportunities. It is of great importance that we keep pushing the boundaries with the aim to be in the top of the class of green and circular innovation,” says Betina Simonsen, Lifestyle & Design Cluster, in Denmark.

Circular Hotspots are public private platforms in which companies, knowledge institutes and authorities can collaborate with the aim of exchanging knowledge and stimulating entrepreneurship in the field of circular economy.

REGISTER FOR WEBCAST (CPD accredited)

BNP Paribas Asset Management has cross-listed the BNP Paribas Easy ECPI Circular Economy Leaders UCITS ETF on Deutsche Börse Xetra.

The fund, which first launched on Euronext Paris at the end of May, invests in companies that ascribe to the so-called ‘circular economy’ business model.

A circular economy aims to keep resources in use for as long as possible, extracting the maximum value from them whilst in use, before recovering and regenerating products and materials at the end of each service life.

The system contrasts to the traditional linear economy where resources and products are disposed of once they have been used.

This difference in approach is often characterized by proponents as “Reduce-Reuse-Recycle” versus “Take-Make-Dispose”.

The fund is linked to the ECPI Circular Economy Leaders Equity Index, an index created by Milan-headquartered ESG indexing and research group ECPI.

The index selects constituents from the universe of global developed market stocks with market capitalizations greater than €500 million and average daily traded values of at least €5m. Companies involved in armaments or tobacco production are removed.

The index selection process screens the remaining universe according to ECPI’s proprietary ranking methodology which considers key ESG issues faced by firms relative to their industry. Companies that do not receive a positive rating are eliminated. The universe is further screened to include only those firms that ECPI has determined operate with a circular economy business model, typically fitting into one of the following five themes: circular supplies; resource recovery; product life extension; sharing platforms; and product as a service.

The 50 largest stocks are selected to form the final index while accounting for sector constraints to limit deviations relative to the universe. The index is equally weighted and rebalanced semi-annually in January and July.

Over half (55.3%) of the index is exposed to stocks listed in the US with the next largest country exposures being Japan (15.1%), France (13.0%) and The Netherlands (4.5%). Index weights are fairly evenly distributed between the information technology (23.1%), consumer discretionary (21.9%), consumer staples (19.7%), and industrials (19.1%) sectors.

132,New Report on Circular Procurement in public construction projects shows how targeted action can drive system-level impact,"New Report on Circular Procurement in public construction projects shows how targeted action can drive system-level impact

Public procurement affects a substantial share of world trade, amounting to more than €1.3 trillion per year. In the EU, the public purchase of goods and services has been estimated to be worth 16% of GDP. This makes public procurement an ideal tool to create more opportunities for low-CO2, circular products, and cities have here a key role to play.

The new Circular Cities report was published today on the occasion of the World Circular Economy Forum taking place in Helsinki, a city that has pledged to integrate sustainability in 100% of its procurement processes by 2020. The White Paper recognises the important role that public authorities play in the transition to a circular economy and points that circular procurement specific focusing on construction project can be the instrument to address the increasing challenge that cities face regarding their resources.

“The public sector in general is uniquely positioned to take the required long-term perspective when setting ambitious goals and driving positive change for local economies, with city officials and policy makers positioned as key actors” explains Peter Vangsbo, Circular Cities Lead and Nordic Business Developer at the EIT Climate-KIC.

The European Commission acknowledges green and circular public procurement as a driver of the transition towards a circular economy and sustainable development. In particular, the EU Action Plan for a Circular Economy sets an agenda for action to integrate the principles of circularity within Member States and at local level, notably through circular procurement. As the report points out, this is an incentive for public buyers to take a more holistic approach to sustainability: enabling them to drive the decarbonation of entire economic sectors and large purchase areas rather than smaller, point-based greening efforts.

Finally, the report also analyses the potential for an economic domino effect: if cities increase their demand for circular solutions, it becomes more attractive for designers and producers to offer circular products and services.",Netherlands,2019.06
134,The circular economy — A pillar of EU economic policy,"The circular economy has quickly become a central element of European economic policy. The aim of politicians and businesses is to reduce the use of fossil raw materials through recycling and reuse, and to replace them with renewable alternatives.

The European Commission is currently preparing legislation that aims to step up the recycling of oil-based plastics.

“We are collaborating closely with industry; the Plastics Alliance we have brought together includes representatives from the whole value chain. Their task is to solve the problem of how to increase the recovery, recycling and reuse of plastics in Europe,” explains European Commission Vice-President Jyrki Katainen.

The EU Plastics Strategy is one of the Commission’s initiatives to further the circular economy. According to Katainen, the logic of a functional circular economy is based on market economics; the circular economy will succeed and create growth only when it results in economic gains all along the value chain.

“Through economic incentives and new legislation, we aim to encourage companies to shift their linear business models towards a circular economy. Currently, less than a third of all plastic is collected for recycling, but I believe that the market will change drastically in the near future,” says Katainen.

“The Commission’s goal is to quadruple the capacity for plastic recycling by the year 2030, at which point all plastic packaging entering the EU market will be recyclable or reusable,” he adds.

To date, the EU’s Horizon 2020 research programme has distributed over EUR 250 million in funding for research and development in the various segments of the Plastics Strategy. A further EUR 100 million will be available up to the end of 2020.

The EU follows closely the progress of circular economy

The forest industry also has a central role to play as a contributor to the circular economy. “We want to make the bioeconomy an even more integral component of the circular economy. We can replace fossil raw materials with raw materials derived from biomass, which additionally supports the EU’s climate goals,” Katainen says.

The functionality of the circular economy varies in different EU countries. “We’re monitoring the implementation of the circular economy in the EU with the help of ten indicators. Monitoring is based on data produced by Eurostat. The member countries also have their own indicators. Data collection is important not only for our ability to monitor the enforcement of legislation, but also to determine whether additional legislation is needed.”

Katainen points out that many areas of the policy are new and haven’t yet come into effect. According to legislation passed by the EU, by 2035, no more than 10 percent of household waste can end up in landfills.

“For implementation to be efficient on a national level, we need at least a Europe-wide market for recycled plastic.”

The EU also aims to create an international market for circular economy products, and the topic has been central to trade negotiations with countries such as China and Japan.

China placed significant restrictions on the import of recyclable raw materials in 2017. As a result, the world market for recyclable materials collapsed. Europe exported only 5.1 million tonnes of plastic waste to China last year — about half of the previous year’s exports.

Katainen understands China’s decision, as the country is facing a major waste problem. The reduction in exports has worsened Europe’s plastic problem, but at the same time, it serves as encouragement for the recycling and reuse of plastics in Europe.

“Hopefully plastic waste won’t be exported to other Asian countries where environmental standards are weaker,” Katainen adds.

The polluting of the oceans has changed the way people think about plastics.

“A large proportion of the rubbish that ends up in the oceans is plastic, and that applies to rubbish from the EU, as well. This creates serious problems for the environment — and human health is affected by microplastics too. Citizens and politicians strongly support changes in legislation, so we have to take advantage of the situation,” he points out.

“The circular economy is also an important component of climate policy. When the legislation is successfully implemented, the EU will function better than before. Replacing fossil raw materials with new materials doesn’t need to mean increasing costs and a lower quality of life – the circular economy can also function as a strong foundation for economic growth.”

148,Your crash course in... the circular economy,"A breakdown of the opportunities and challenges for businesses heading towards the circular economy.

NEXT WEEK, ABOUT 2,000 finance and sustainability experts will descend upon Helsinki to discuss the circular economy at the third annual World Circular Economy Forum.

More than an EU buzzword, the circular economy has been gathering momentum, particularly with the ‘green wave’ during the recent European Parliamentary elections.

In 2015, the European Commission brought in a series of legislative and non-legislative actions as part of the ‘Circular Economy Package’. It set out targets covering production, consumption and waste management with a view to ‘closing the loop’ in the next few years.

This not only effects individual member states, but will bring changes to how businesses are required to operate in future, with targets on recycling and product design.

What is the circular economy?

In a linear economy – the more common model – products are bought, used, and discarded. In a circular economy, the products are refurbished or upgraded so they can keep being used.

According to Neil Walker, Ibec’s head of Infrastructure, Energy and Environment, it’s not just about increased efficiency.

“It’s designing things so that they keep their value longer, they can be reused at the end of their life, that they’re easily recyclable and that taking things to bits doesn’t expose you to toxic ingredients or components.”

The idea is to maximise value in both products and finite raw materials, like elemental metals which are used in a lot of hardware – like in smartphones and tablets.

In the next few weeks, Ibec will be publishing a report on how well businesses in different sectors understand the concept, the package and their obligations – and “more importantly, whether they see it as an opportunity”, said Walker.

How are businesses tackling it?

Earlier this year furniture giant IKEA announced plans to trial a furniture leasing scheme – with options to return for refurbishment and resale – in some countries.

Per Stoltz, resource and waste manager with IKEA, said the company has been moving towards a more sustainable business model for years. That’s accelerated recently because of customers’ changing view of ownership and consumption.

“We are having issues around climate and resource scarcity, and listening to customers, we can clearly see that they want to be part of the solution. They ask us, as a big company, to show them how,” he told Fora.

“We are still a company that wants to grow. The idea around the circular economy is to not have a one-to-one link to growth and resource use,” he said.

Larger companies such as IKEA are getting a better understanding of the model, while smaller ones are moving with the times too.

Aisling Byrne, co-founder and CEO of The Nu Wardrobe, told Fora the company just raised £215,000 in a pre-seed round led by Sustainable Ventures, on top of previous investment from Bethnal Green.

The company is a platform for sharing clothing – inspired by the founders’ love for fashion leasing giant Rent The Runway, which recently announced plans for a tech hub in Galway creating 150 jobs.

In the next few months, The Nu Wardrobe is planning to test out a new membership-based business model which it hopes to launch in September.

What are the challenges?

One of the biggest challenge of the circular economy is creating demand for secondary raw materials and upgraded products. Another challenge is our attachment to packaging, which can be difficult to recycle.

Fast fashion – of lower grade materials – sold badly in earlier incarnations of The Nu Wardrobe, said Byrne, so the emphasis for the new phase is on quality.

“If people don’t borrow it, we’re not going to reduce the impact, and people are going to go and buy something new,” she said.

Items which contain potentially toxic materials – like fire retardants – also can’t be reused in just anything, like a child’s toy, so businesses have to become more creative in how products are designed in the first place.

Electronic waste is one of the largest streams of waste in the world – producing about 50 million tonnes a year – according to Wisetek CEO Seán Sheehan.

One of the concerns around a circular model is a reduction in turnover due to fewer goods being sold, but the businesses who have moved towards it have argued that it creates new jobs in maintenance, repair and leasing.

Wisetek specialises in processing e-waste into reusable materials – and has processed about 100,000 tonnes of material so far, and $1 billion in components recovered for client internal use.

How is Ireland doing?

The Government will shortly publish and start implementing the ‘All of Government Climate Plan’, which will include actions across all sectors to cut greenhouse gases and manage resources more efficiently.

A spokesperson for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment said that “the government is fully committed to the EU’s Circular Economy legislative package and is on track to meet and indeed exceed the targets contained therein.”

As a country, we have already beaten EU packaging targets for wood, ferrous materials, glass and paper for 2025 – and on track for 2030 – but have some way to go on plastics.

Byrne, the founder of Nu Wardrobe, recently moved to London, where she believes the opportunities are greater for companies wanting to work towards a circular economy – she thinks Ireland is still behind on circular thinking.

“I didn’t want to move away, but I had to because everywhere I went people didn’t want to hear about it. When I was pitching, they would just tell me not to talk about the environmental impact,” she said.

1.5 million visitors will be celebrating Berlin’s four-day multicultural carnival in the streets of Kreuzberg this June. The open-air festival offers a range of performances, festivals and parties from different people in the community - one that makes Berlin so wonderfully diverse. Karneval der Kulturen champions having a returnable system at the event’s food and drink stands to avoid any single-use plastic and unnecessary waste. We’ve all walked away from festivals and witnessed a newly formed carpet of crushed plastic, so we admire their commitment to deter festival goers from buying throwaway plastic cups from other vendors.

The annual event ‘Art Basel’ will once again be bringing the international world of art together in the Swiss cultural capital, to celebrate the works of over 4,000 artists. Enjoy a plethora of paintings, drawings, sculpture, prints, photography, installations, digital art and video to immerse yourself in Modern and Contemporary art. The event will host a series of events, exhibitions and insightful talks from art world experts that will invite you to reflect on topics that concern the art scene across the world. We’ve picked out a couple of talks we think will provoke an interesting discussion about Art’s environmental impact.

Artworld Talk / The Carbon Footprint of Contemporary Art - the environmental impact of the art exhibition movement - Are art organisations becoming more ecologically responsible?

‘Artworld Talk / Let’s Talk About the Weather’ - Can artists have an effective and positive impact on our relationship with nature?

Men’s Fashion Week is on in Milan, London, New York and Paris this June, but we’re interested to see how environmentally conscious Paris is this year, in light of its new environmental plan. In February of this year, Paris announced that by 2024 it aims to be the world’s most sustainable fashion capital. The ‘Paris Good Fashion Plan’ will focus on improving traceability and sourcing, creating a circular economy and making sure that energy used is more sustainable, according to WWD. In June, we are to expect a more detailed project outline of recycled fashion campaigns and conferences that will be held to discuss sustainability. With Paris’ commitment to this initiative in mind, we’re excited to see how industry players are beginning to implement these eco-conscious practices.

151,A bug’s life – How industrious insects are recycling food waste for farmers,"A bug’s life – How industrious insects are recycling food waste for farmers

Two Fenland firms have found an inventive solution to food waste by recycling rotting fruit back into farmland as a non-toxic bug repellent – with the help of some industrious insects.

Waste fruit crops are being fed to insect larvae to generate a valuable by-product for farmers - and it is all thanks to a mutually-beneficial partnership within East Anglia's ""circular economy"".

Food waste has become a growing consumer concern, with a recent study by campaign group Feedback estimating that as many as four million UK people could be fed their ""five a day"" from fruit and vegetables that are currently rejected for cosmetic reasons such as colour, shape and size.

One company which has found novel ways to address this problem is AMT Fruit, part of the Munoz Group, based in Chatteris near Ely - one of the UK's largest citrus specialists, working with over 250 growers to supply Tesco with about 140 million nets of fruit each year.

Between 2015 and 2018, the firm says it has reduced its operational waste by 30pc by broadening retail product specifications, introducing new ""over-sized"" product lines, improving delivery strategies to extend shelf life, and donating one million portions of fruit via food charities.

But despite these efforts the organisation still generates more than 2,000 tonnes of waste each year from its UK operation - prompting an inventive partnership with a fellow Fenland firm.

AgriGrub, based in nearby Soham, feeds the waste vegetables and fruit to the ravenous larvae of black soldier flies which are branded as Calci worms and sold as a form of live pet food for reptiles.

Their by-product is called frass - a sustainable source of plant nutrients, and a bio-repellent for crop protection.

Naomi Pendleton, head of technical at AMT Fruit, said: ""Our citrus waste is too wet and acidic and full of rots and moulds which makes it unpalatable for animal feed. We were having to send all our waste to AD [anaerobic digestion] plants. At the start of 2018 we were introduced to Joe Halstead from AgriGrub, who was looking for locally sourced viable waste products on which to grow his black soldier fly larvae.""

""This is a great example of a circular economy created through a mutually beneficial relationship.""

Joe Halstead, managing director of Agrigrub, said the active component in frass is called chitosan, which is already well-documented as an efficient biopesticide - but for many years the cost of extracting it was considered too great, as the process involved boiling crustacean shells in sulphuric acid.

Frass from insects, however, needs little processing and represents an economically viable source of chitosan for agriculture, he said.

""We are focusing our attention at the moment on higher margin crops which have few treatment options for pests and diseases as this is likely to give us the best return in the least time,"" said Mr Halstead.

""However, longer-term I hope and expect frass to have broad-acre application, especially where neonicotinoids [pesticides now banned by the EU] are being phased out. Our first frass trials, on brassicas, showed a 94pc reduction in aphid numbers on frass-treated plants versus controls.

""It is in the field where routine synthetic pesticide usage is most damaging to our environment, so ideally we'd like to see frass and its bio-repellent qualities used in the field to repel insects rather than killing them. This spares non-pest species and allows beneficial insects to persist in the local environment.""

Naomi Pendleton will discuss the project at an Agri-Tech East event in Norwich next week, named Closing the Loop on the Circular Economy.

Dr Belinda Clarke, director of Agri-Tech East, said: ""Food waste is a major issue and the work AMT Fruit is doing with AgriGrub is one of a number of inspirational approaches that use waste from one process as input to another. The event will also look at novel uses for coffee waste and ways of producing fertiliser from greenhouse gas.""

Other speakers at the event include Gareth Roberts of Cambond, Peter Hammond of CCm Technologies, Steve Taylor of Celbius and Dr Claudio Avignone Rossa, reader in systems microbiology at the University of Surrey. It will be chaired by Meredith Lloyd Evans, chief executive of BioBridge.

165,Paper Presents: innovative and circular solutions for consumers,"On September 4th, CEPI, FEFCO, ACE, and FEPE organised an interactive exhibition called Paper Presents (see the video here) to introduce the paper and board industry to the new members of the European Parliament. Along with several national paper associations that took part in the event as well, the paper and board industry was able to highlight the endless possibilities of paper products, the innovation they bring, and the circularity at the core of their industry.

“There are themes that CEPI and the co-organising partners have in common. Renewability, recyclability and the ability to mitigate climate change is what we have, we are proud of and we share with society,” said Jori Ringman, CEPI Director General.

One of the most interesting parts for the members of the Parliament was certainly the exhibition, which brought paper and board innovations to one place and showcased a large selection of ingenuous and sustainable inventions all created with paper and forest-fibre products. The Tree- Shirt is a great example. Based on Tencel Lyocell fibres made from sustainable wood sources, textiles can be made and thus, clothing. The fibres are produced in an environmentally responsible closed loop process, which transforms wood pulp into cellulosic fibres with high resource efficiency and low ecological impact.

Innovations in packaging were also on display, including Landbox Straw which, using organic, recyclable and hygienic materials, insulates products with shock absorption qualities during transit. Stretching Inner part, a bio-based and recyclable packaging material that protects fragile goods in transit, was also on exhibit.

There were also paper and board innovations meant for the food and drink industry. Wetclar paper straws was one example. These straws are made of virgin fibres produced specifically for food contact and certified by FSC, PEFC and ECOLABEL. They are also treated against humidity and guarantee hydrophobicity. All in all, the straws are a great alternative to single-use plastic ones. Other products, such as beverage cartons, are also constantly innovating to improve functionality while offering a low carbon footprint. Participants could taste water in beverage carton which is a new segment driven by the consumers demand for environmentally friendly products.

What is very important about the paper and board industry—and the products made with these materials—is that it is circular. Recycling rates for these materials are the highest in Europe.

The paper and board products are closing the loop and championing the circular economy, which is so important for Europe’s future.

“Our material is circular by nature. It can be 100% recycled and what distinguishes it from other materials is that it promises recyclability and it is also effectively recycled all over Europe,” said Angelika Christ, FEFCO’s Secretary General.

It is part of the industry’s belief in making sound environmental choices and enabling a good future for Europe and Europeans. Lisa Kretschmann, the Managing Director of FEPE, representing companies in the paper envelope manufacturing sector, explained: “Envelopes and mail are not just the only way to reach citizens in all corners of the #EU. For 60-80% of them, they are also the preferred means to receive important information.”

The paper and board industry is committed to supporting forest growth in Europe. Annick Carpentier, ACE Director General, announced that for every guest who attended the Paper Presents event, one tree will be planted. “This is one more reason to say thank you to everyone who joined us tonight.” You can follow CEPI Paper, FEFCO, ACE and FEPE on social media or online news for updates on this.

Every consumer must make a choice about the kind of products he or she wants to buy. The paper and board products are the ideal choice because they are the perfect example of the circular economy. This industry reflects a responsible future for Europe. The innovations within the sector continue to meet the increasing consumer demand for sustainable products.

We will continue to communicate about the sustainability of the paper products and new developments to the members of the European Parliament. We are committed to being a responsible and active partner in the circular economy.

CEPI – The Confederation of European Paper Industries is a Brussels-based non-profit making organisation regrouping the European pulp and paper industry and championing this industry’s achievements and the benefits of its products. Its mission is to promote the members’ business sector by taking specific actions notably, by monitoring and analysing activities and initiatives in the areas of industry, environment, energy, forestry, recycling, fiscal policies and competitiveness in general. Through CEPI, the paper industry increases its visibility and acts on emerging issues, making expert and constructive contributions on behalf of the industry.

FEFCO – European Federation of Corrugated Board Manufacturers represents the interests of the European Corrugated Board Manufacturers. Headquartered in Brussels, FEFCO has 17 association members, all European national corrugated packaging organisations. The role of the Federation is to investigate economic, financial, technical and marketing issues of interest to the corrugated packaging industry, analyse all factors which may influence the industry, and promote and develop its image.

FEPE – The European Federation of Envelope Manufacturers is an international association representing more than 100 companies who are directly or indirectly involved in the paper envelope manufacturing sector in Europe. These comprise envelope manufacturing companies and suppliers.

ACE – The Alliance for Beverage Cartons and the Environment provides a European platform for beverage carton manufacturers Tetra Pak, SIG Combibloc and Elopak and their paperboard suppliers in Europem, Stora Enso and BillerudKorsnäs, to benchmark and profile cartons as renewable, recyclable and low carbon packaging solutions.

169,Policy enablers to accelerate the circular economy,"Over the past couple of years, as companies start to understand the opportunities that lie under the concept of circular economy, the conversation has gained significant momentum. At the same time, governments at the national and regional level are developing frameworks and regulations to promote the circular economy.

Effective policymaking is crucial in accelerating and scaling up circular actions in the economy. They support businesses in overcoming hurdles by stimulating innovative projects and long-term investments in circularity, facilitating collaboration and partnerships, and producing tangible results.

Learning from successful policies can help inform future policies to promote wider actions in other sectors and regions over time.

By highlighting some representative pioneers in circular economy policy, exploring key enablers from these policies, describing how other regions could replicate these enablers and providing recommendations, this publication aims to provide insights from the policy perspective and to feed into the ongoing development of other initiatives and policies related to the circular economy globally.",Netherlands,2019.09
172,What is a circular economy?,"No-one likes waste, but it becomes even more frustrating and worrying when that waste is linked to Planet Earth. We are running out of resources and the world is and not even slowly dying. Climate change is on most people's radar now and with good reason. If we don't change our ways soon, future generations will be lucky if they end up living in a Mad Max-style environment. It's an incredibly sorry state of affairs when that's the best we can hope for. Up until recently, people the world over have enjoyed a want-it-now, super-disposable existence. A life of convenience and speed has satisfied historic needs, but it has come at a price; one future generations will be paying ad infinitum. Our seasons are changing, our wildlife is dying, and our sea levels are rising at worrying rates. While we can't undo what's already happened, there are things that can be done to minimise future damage. One of these is the concept known as a circular economy. What is a circular economy and how does it work? A linear economy goes only in one direction. From the creation of a product, through to its use and then to its end of life and ultimate disposal. It's resource intensive and wasteful, plus incredibly short sighted.

The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, and many others, dub this ""take-make-waste."" ""The linear economy has to change,"" the foundation states. ""We must transform all the elements of the take-make-waste system: how we manage resources, how we make and use products, and what we do with the materials afterwards. Only then can we create a thriving economy that can benefit everyone within the limits of our planet."" A circular economy looks at the bigger picture. The idea is to reduce waste through an entire product's lifecycle, from its inception and creation through to how it can be reused or recycled at the stage it would, historically, simply have been thrown away. The majority (around 80%) of the environmental impact made by a product stems from the design phase. As such, a circular economy looks at sustainability as a design inclusion rather than an afterthought. In doing so, manufacturers can ensure they are minimising waste from the offset, creating products that can be used for as long as possible and then creating new use cases so that a product continues to be of value rather than becoming obsolete as would be the case in a linear economy. What are the benefits of a circular economy? There are many benefits to a circular economy, some obvious and immediate and some not so clear-cut or short-term. The ability to reduce the amount of stress and suffering on the environment is a no brainer, but there are myriad other benefits, too. One positive side effect for businesses aside from doing the right thing is the ability to increase profitability. On the face of it, creating fewer ""new"" things may seem a barrier to increased financial health, but making better use of resources can offer a win for organisations. Indeed, McKinsey carried out a major study with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation a few years ago that found the efficient reuse of natural capital could give Europe a 3% boost in resource productivity come 2030, while at the same time generating savings of 600 billion a year and 1.8 trillion more in the form of other economic benefits.

""The circular economy is your biggest challenge and your biggest opportunity. Celebrated as a catalyst for disruptive innovation, it can still result in nothing more imaginative than recycling initiatives... A clear example of this happens in the steel industry, which recently described itself as the Permanent Material in the Circular Economy'. Why knock down a building to melt a girder to make a girder, when the original girder was robust?"" said Nick Liddell, visiting fellow at Cranfield University and director of strategy at The Clearing. ""Amazing things happen as a result of collaboration; entirely new ways to unlock value at different levels of the economy emerge. The circular economy is a great way to get people asking interesting questions they wouldn't otherwise consider. ""Tomorrow's leaders won't be the businesses that most effectively stamp on their competitors. The future belongs to those who can balance the art of competition with the art of collaboration. And the question of what have we got that we can share' is worth spending time on,"" he added. In many respects, the UK is actually doing quite well in terms of focusing on sustainability at all levels. The government launched a 25-year environmental plan in 2018 in a bid to outline what the country could do and is doing in respect of helping to deliver on wider CSR goals. ""Our strategy sets out how we will go further and faster, to reduce, reuse, and recycle. We will cut our reliance on single-use plastics, end confusion over household recycling, tackle the problem of packaging by making polluters pay, and end the economic, environmental and moral scandal that is food waste,"" Michael Gove, Environment Secretary, said at the time. All UN member states have committed to sustainable development goals (SDGs), which aim to make the world a better place by reducing poverty, eradicating hunger, ensuring clean water and sanitation, tackling climate change, and more. The aim is to meet the SDGs by 2030. There are 17 core goals in total and number 12 is responsible consumption and production, which fits squarely into the aims of a circular economy. ""Everyone is needed to reach these ambitious targets,"" according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). ""The creativity, knowhow, technology and financial resources from all of society is necessary to achieve the SDGs in every context."" With bold aims set at an organisational, governmental and geographical level to reach, fairly soon, net zero, there is much to be done to achieve them. A report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, published in September 2019, suggested archiving this net zero aim would never be possible without a circular economy approach being actively embraced. ""Switching to renewable energy plays a vital role in addressing climate change, but this alone will not be enough. In order to achieve targets on climate, it is critical that we transform how we design, make, and use products, and food. Completing the picture through a transition to a circular economy can enable us to meet the needs of a growing global population, while creating a prosperous and resilient economy that can run in the long term,"" said Dame Ellen MacArthur, founder of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. ""This paper [Completing the Picture: How the Circular Economy Tackles Climate Change] shows that transitioning to a circular economy is not only an opportunity to tackle emissions across sectors, but to design an economy that is restorative and regenerative, creating benefits for society, businesses, and the environment.""

176,5 of our favourite thought provoking sustainability podcasts | Living,"Podcasts have really taken off over the last few years as many people's media of choice. Easily accessible, they are a saviour for commuters as these short audio pieces can be downloaded to listen on the go. Not just that, but they are an easy way to let experts enlighten you about all kinds of interesting subjects. Pick something, plug in, and you can almost forget that you are shoulder to shoulder with pushy businessmen on the early morning intercity express.

Here at Euronews Living, we are definitely converts. With over half a million podcasts currently being made, there's bound to be something to pique everyone's interest in this ever evolving format. This seemingly endless choice can be pretty overwhelming, though, and the wrong choice could put a bad spin on the rest of your day.

To help you out we've put together a by no means exhaustive list of some things we think you should listen to. Unsurprisingly, our go to morning listening is often about sustainability so here's a list of some of our best podcasts if you want to stay informed about environmentalism.

Each week, Ol and Dave, two supposed experts in environmentalism tackle pressing issues in a humorous way. This podcast styles itself as ""for and by the confused"" as the hosts try ""to be cheery in the face of impending ecological disaster"". Sustainababble is packed with dry, British humour to cut through the doom and gloom of trying to keep up with the ongoing climate crisis.

Both hosts work for environmental charities so you can expect in depth knowledge on climate issues despite the comic approach. They hope that by breaking things down in a simple way that their sustainability message will be a bit more accessible. With over 100 episodes there's enough to keep you entertained and educated on your morning commute.

For a taste of Ol and Dave's distinctive hosting style check out episode 97 with activist George Monbiot which opens with them calling him ""a bit of a misery guts"".

Clare Press is Vogue Australia's Sustainability Editor-at-large and Wardrobe Crisis is her podcast where she quizzes experts about all your fashion concerns. As you'd imagine with Press's impressive history in journalism, she has extensive knowledge of the industry that she uses to get the best out of her guests on their expert subjects.

Expect subjects from cultural appropriation to the circular economy; it's definitely not a podcast that merely dips its toes in the water of positive fashion choices. Episodes will leave you keen to start googling and incensed at the injustices of the garment industry.

Press's ability to find herself sat down in front of a microphone with leading innovators, like this episode with Ellen MacArthur Foundation's Francois Souchet, reliably makes for some interesting, though provoking listening.

Husband and wife team, Ella and Matt Mills, are behind wellness brand Deliciously Ella. As well as running a deli, creating delicious plant-based foods, writing recipe books and looking after a growing social media community (phew!) the pair also host a podcast.

With a featured guest, they cover everything from physical health and well-being to nutrition to sustainability issues. One of our favourite episodes features a discussion with 'green carpet' movement founder and UN leader for change Livia Firth. The pair sit down with this ""queen of sustainable fashion"" to talk about everything from looking good while doing good to how responsible purchases can help the people who make our clothes.

Other subjects the Mills' have covered include achieving a balanced vegan diet, food waste and climate change, and how to have a healthy gut.

Kamea Chayne hosts this podcast that looks towards intersectional sustainability through conversations with thought leaders. Green Dreamer hopes to help listeners ""learn what it means to thrive, in every sense of the word"". Linking her audience with resources to help them make sure that they address environmental issues alongside social injustice, Chayne features a wide variety of guests.

In episode 172, Chayne speaks to Fashionista's Associate Editor, Whitney Bauck, about the psychology of consumerism. Touching on the influence of social media as well as the desire to buy things to make ourselves feel better. The podcast uses an approachable back to basics method to explain fast fashion to even the uninitiated.

Green Dreamer doesn't just explore fashion, Chayne also examines complex topics like gene-editing and economics. If you like variety this could be the listen for you.

Looking into the impact of our fashion choices, Conscious Chatter sees Kestrel Jenkins chat with guests that range from owners of eco-friendly startups to internationally renowned writers. Jenkins started out at sustainable brand, People Tree, which inspired her to want to do something more to engage people in conscious fashion.

It doesn't skim the surface of sustainability, however, and a chat with Elizabeth Paton, New York Times Style writer, delves into the potential exploitation of cheap clothing manufacture. This episode is particularly enlightening as Jenkins asks about positive fashion's use of prison labour and whether or not this can ever be ethical. Paton talks about how, perhaps unexpectedly, luxury brands are using this form of labour to make their clothes and debates whether this can ever be beneficial to inmates. Its a very interesting listen if you feel like diving into some of the more complex issues in the industry.",France,2019.09
177,We can hand on the natural environment in a better state than we found it,"We can hand on the natural environment in a better state than we found it

Brexit gives us a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; a chance that no environment secretary has had for decades. When we leave the EU we will have the chance to take back control – control of our fisheries, our farming, and our rules on protection of animal welfare and the environment. That would enable us to drive forward the goal we have set ourselves to be the first generation to hand on the natural environment in a better state than we found it.

I want our farmers to be released from the unnecessary complexity and rigidity of the Common Agricultural Policy. We will implement a new system of support which rewards farmers for environmental stewardship and improving the health and welfare of animals, and which helps them become more productive, more successful and more sustainable.

This will be based on the principle of public money for public goods; it will be designed for our domestic needs; and it will be underpinned by a reformed and proportionate approach to regulation and enforcement.

As well as securing vital goals for our environment and animal welfare, one of my core aims is to provide a stable platform for our farming, food and drink sectors to thrive and seize the opportunities provided by Brexit to sell our high-quality food into new markets all around the world.

In Parliament, I look forward to bringing forward key pieces of legalisation. The Environment Bill will embed environmental ambition and accountability at the heart of government; our Agriculture Bill will reward farmers for tackling the causes and effects of climate change and enhancing the natural environment; and our Fisheries Bill will enable us to manage stocks more sustainably and set us on a path to a fairer deal for our fishing communities.

Our country is at a crossroads and we have to act now. So this Conservative Government is driving forward a global agenda to tackle plastics pollution in our oceans. We were the first major economy in the world to make a commitment to net zero emissions by 2050, and we are taking action to accelerate progress on securing cleaner water in our rivers and lakes, and cleaner air to breathe.

A key goal of our new Environment Bill will be to improve air quality so that our children live longer, healthier lives. It will help restore habitats and increase biodiversity across the UK. It will create the conditions for a move towards a more circular economy, where manufacturers, consumers and local councils share responsibility for reducing waste and increasing recycling and reuse. And it will ensure that we can better manage our precious water resources in a changing climate

I will also champion the food and drink industry around the cabinet table. This is the biggest manufacturing sector in the UK, with exports worth £22.5bn. Our produce is renowned for its quality. As we leave the European Union we will be working to ensure that Brexit works for this industry and that we open up new markets for them around the world.

The coming months will provide big challenges for the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs. For over 40 years, the great majority of the work of the department has been implementing policies and decisions made in Brussels. All that will change as we press ahead with leaving the EU.

I am working to ensure we are ready for that huge transition and ready to deliver the ambitious environmental agenda that the prime minister has set us on matters such as protecting biodiversity and habitats, enabling nature recovery, and harnessing nature-based solutions to meet our commitment to becoming a net zero carbon economy.

These issues are regularly raised with me by children and young people. They have shot up the political agenda, and this Conservative Government is determined to rise to the challenge which these young people have set us.

181,Developing critical raw materials in Europe,"Director-General for the European Commission’s JRC, Vladimír Šucha, explains the role the European Innovation Partnership on Raw Materials plays in the development of critical raw materials in Europe.

The Joint Research Centre (JRC) is the European Commission’s science and knowledge service which employs scientists to carry out research in order to provide independent scientific advice and support to EU policy. In accordance to this, the European Innovation Partnership on Raw Materials (EIP RM) is a stakeholder platform that brings together representatives from industry, public services, academia and NGOs. Its mission is to provide high-level guidance to the European Commission, Members States and private actors on innovative approaches to the challenges related to raw materials.

SciTech Europa Quarterly speaks with Vladimír Šucha, Director-General of the JRC, about the importance of the partnership between the JRC and the RMIS, and the current trends in raw materials.

What is the work and role of the JRC?

The JRC is there to put science at the heart of EU policy making. We produce and manage scientific evidence, data and information for decision makers at all levels from policy officers to Commissioners, but also Members of the European Parliament and Member State authorities.

Our scientific support covers a wide range of policy areas, whilst also understanding the policy needs, we diversified into areas such as agriculture, transport, climate change and Earth observation. Now, while we continue doing our best in those areas, we are also focusing on the major European and global challenges, such as artificial intelligence and digital economy, cyber-security, food security, migration, mobility or low-carbon society. What we offer in all of these policy areas is not merely research, but relevant context, scientifically sound insights, and knowledge management to help shape better policies and strategies. The policies for raw materials are one of those areas where EU Member States are fully in the driving seat, and we are responsible for proposing strategies, initiatives and action plans for harmonising the measures taken by Member States and representing them in global projects.

We are on the High-Level Steering Group, bringing in the science-evidence perspective, and we are also involved in many operational and working groups. Moreover, our knowledge management expertise plays a key role in improving the EU Raw Materials Knowledge Base, particularly in developing the Raw Materials Information System (RMIS). The RMIS is the European Commission’s knowledge platform on abiotic and biotic raw materials along their entire supply chains. It includes, among others, raw materials profiles, country profiles and trade, environmental and social aspects of raw material markets. It is also the depository of results of current Horizon 2020 projects on Raw Materials and circular economy calls.

Can you tell us about the European Innovation Partnership on Raw Materials?

The EIP RM was established in 2012 to reinforce the objectives of the Raw Materials Initiative: the fair and sustainable supply of raw materials from global markets for the EU, ensuring resource efficiency. It also aims to raise awareness about the security of supply of raw materials. Moreover, the EIP RM has been instrumental in securing Research and Innovation funding for the industrial sectors related to raw materials supply chains, with important contributions to investments through the FP7 and Horizon 2020 EU Research Programmes.

The EIP RM Strategic Implementation Plan was approved in 2013, setting out the objectives, targets and actions for EU raw materials policy by 2020. Among others, they focused on the coordination of research and innovation, the development of technologies for raw materials production and the substitution of raw materials, waste management, and improving the skills and knowledge base and better positioning the EU as a global actor.

What are the biggest trends in raw materials?

The Commission’s 2018 EU Raw materials Scoreboard, produced by the JRC and the RMIS, offer some illustrative examples. The global supply and demand for raw materials has increased considerably over the last 40 years. Now, the ongoing energy transition is also bringing about a shift towards the more intensive use of certain minerals and critical raw materials. Global material extraction has grown 14-fold, from six billion tonnes in 1900 to around 84 billion tonnes in 2015. The biggest increase was observed for non-metallic minerals with a 45-fold increase, followed by a 39-fold increase for metallic minerals, a 15-fold increase for fossil fuels and a more than 5-fold increase for biomass.

In the last 20 years, the global production of nickel and copper doubled, whilst the production of iron and aluminium more than doubled. With respect to battery raw materials, the production of cobalt and lithium increased four and 2.8 times. Finally, rare earths production grew by 1.5 times. In line with global economic trends, the consumption of raw materials in Asia (primarily in China) has increased exponentially in the last decades, surpassing the rest of the world back in 2006. Resource use is expected to grow at similarly high rates unless we become more efficient and innovative in using them. In fast developing regions, up to three billion people will move from low to middle class patterns of consumption by 2030. As a result, by 2050, global metals extraction and biomass production could increase by at least 50 % and non-metallic minerals production by at least 100%.

Looking at the EU, our roadmap for electrification of road transport estimates an increase in the number of electric vehicles by more than 15 million by 2025. High quantities of critical and non-critical raw materials will be needed to sustain this growth in electro-mobility. For electric traction motors, we will need more neodymium, praseodymium and dysprosium. Whereas for the batteries we will need more cobalt, graphite and lithium, whilst building more lightweight body structures will require more niobium.

The same growth is also observed in global trade with raw materials, which increased considerably more than the global trade in all commodities. Iron and copper world trade in volume terms increased 2.5 times since 2000, whereas for nickel it grew more than five-fold. The trade in zinc, lead and aluminum went up by half in less than 20 years. With the increased global concentration in the production of critical raw materials, supply risks increased, and price volatility reached unprecedented heights. The use of non-tariff trade barriers surged affecting all markets, as well as the use of tariffs since 2018 – fueled by the US-China trade war.

What are the main limitations/challenges when it comes to EIP RM?

EIP RM has been very successful in setting actions and implementing them. The main challenge comes from societal and economic dynamics and the way the EU and its Member States design their policies. The EIP RM was created seven years ago and its targets were set for 2020. In the meantime, the EU and its international position changed, and new challenges emerged. We must now go beyond achieving earlier goals and completing our action plans, and we must make EU materials policy a cross-cutting field that influences many other policy areas.

The developments of the last few years point in the right direction with new strategic documents dedicated sections on raw materials include:

The challenge is to bring raw materials actions in line with all the other goals and actions proposed for these other priority areas.

What next for the JRC? How do you see the EIP RM developing in the future?

We have already seen a growing interest in the RM community and industry to move from the linear economic model towards a circular model with focus on the supply chains of raw materials and their security, or on value chains for strategic products that are essential for the competitiveness of the EU economy.

Now there is a clear need to decide on a revision of the EIP RM setting-up a similar follow-up structure in the area of raw materials in Europe. Such a new European project will have to cover the entire value chain of raw materials, by involving sectors in the EU economy with larger shares in value added and jobs and with high innovative potential. We will have to demonstrate how the sustainability and security of raw materials promotes tackling global challenges such as sustainable development, energy transition, biodiversity protection and social responsibility.

The JRC will continue to support the process with its research and knowledge management work. We are involved in the Strategic Action Plan for Batteries; we work on dual-use material. We are evaluating market trends and risks for primary and secondary raw materials, as well as for strategic products containing CRMs. We are also developing further the RMIS as a tool for knowledge management; we work on linking its content to the platforms of various other European projects and organisations and allowing their knowledge to propagate through our platform. We will also use the RMIS to promote new policy ideas and to inform the public about the latest scientific research in the field; we strongly believe that providing an overview on raw material flows in our economy is a great best way to support European manufacturing and enhance its competitiveness and to accelerate innovation.",European Union,2019.09

196,3rd Organizational Creativity and Sustainability International Conference - Sciencesconf.org,"Collective Creativity for a Circular Economy: Connecting Approaches of Education Science, Social and Organizational Change with Playfulness and Digital Technologies

Description: Discussing sustainable development with regard to economic, ecological and social aspects, the complexity and comprehensiveness of perspectives and interdependencies need to be taken into account. With regard to a circular economy this means, natural resources, production, producers, use, users, after-use, waste management, re-use or environment may be considered (Schmidt et al. 2018). The different steps and people within the economy represent various stakeholders and perspectives, more or less independent from each other. Furthermore perspectives of (political and economic) decision makers are independent from workers, users and social as well as environmental systems affected.

Current discussions such as political, economic or academic summits as well as social movements (e.g. Friday for future) show the disconnectedness of perspectives. Furthermore, it looks like creative attempts to solving such issues, are facing challenges, including different agendas and concerns from other stakeholder groups, often do not comply with sustainable development principles. Whereas, dealing with problems of sustainable development requires comprehensive solution finding and applying through new creative ideas (Shrivastava et al. 2016).

Often stakeholders have only limited and selected perspectives to understanding and appreciating sustainable development. These perspectives are influenced by their local and cultural backgrounds, education and professional backgrounds or work and life contexts (Schulz et al. 2018). As a result, these perspectives usually lead to giving different directions to what would be a priority due to constraints or interests. Consequently, supposed sustainable effects for one stakeholder group may have a negative impact on others. For instance, recycled textiles are reused after long distance transportation and compete on their second use with the emergence of local manufacturing businesses. Or, the use of electric vehicles reduces local emission but exploits specific natural resources and demands high production effort. Hence, to bring about sustainable development in terms of a circular economy, the following stages of action can be concluded:
• First, it is essential to draw a comprehensive picture of economic chains, which represent the coherence between all steps, constraints and framework conditions.
• Second, to create a basis for exchange, discussion and development, shared understandings of the comprehensive picture have to be developed among stakeholders.
• Third, based on the shared understanding, new ideas can emerge through revealing stakeholders’ creative potential.

Intensive research has been carried out on the topics of analysing value chains and developing a circular economy (Geissdoerfer et al. 2016), of the characteristics and emerging of shared understandings among different stakeholders (Schulz 2008) and of collective creativity in interdisciplinary teams (Mnisri & Nagati 2012; Sannino & Ellis 2013). However, the dimension and complexity outlined here, is ranging further. Stakeholder groups represent not only cultural diversity, but also different professional and educational levels, generations, various social conditions as well as different influence and power. Furthermore, stakeholders’ local contexts are remote and therefore represent different social conditions, experiences, wealth and living constraints. Nevertheless, all of these stakeholder groups can contribute to sustainable development, even further: they are needed to bring about sustainable development. They are affected by the current economy, albeit in different ways.

Consequently, there is a need to find ways to address this diversity of stakeholders and to make them understand each other, to enable them to discuss the complexity and develop the topic of a circular economy in an adequate way.

This track discussion aims to address this demand from a conceptual and interdisciplinary perspective. The question is mainly methodological, however closely related to the complex demand of discussing economic process chains.

The methodological aspect shall research the question how shared understandings and creative idea development can be achieved among the stakeholder groups and framework described above. Particularly when taking into account a “democratizing” effect of stakeholders, which requires the integration of diverse levels of education, backgrounds and understandings, ways of communicating on an equally accessible level have to be found (e.g. Feldman et al. 2009). Outcomes of current and past research indicate that traditional approaches only addressing cognitive aspects of communication and perception do not lead to satisfying success (e.g. Sköldberg et al. 2015). Alternatively, there exist approaches, which proved convincing results in other contexts. Hence, the following approaches shall be discussed with regard to developing economic cycles towards circular ones:

Furthermore, question arises what role education plays in bringing about understandings of sustainable development. This question is also closely connected to methodology, since children naturally experience their world in collective processes of playing and creative interaction using materials and situations at hand (Potter 2006). Hence, the relation of education with developing shared understanding of economic cycles is a topic to be researched.

Additionally, the asynchronism of time and space due to the distance of stakeholders within economic cycles demands ways of communication and collaboration, which go beyond face to face meetings in small groups. Hence a further question to be considered will be the integration and use of digital technologies in “democratic” approaches of intervention, sharing and idea development (e.g. Riedel et al. 2001; Anthes et al. 2016).

The track will be organized in round table discussion about:
• Experiencing and discussing methodological approaches of intervention and change with the aim to develop a collectively shared understanding and to reveal creative potential to develop new solutions. Particularly to be considered:
• The role of education to understanding and developing circular economy
• Integration of digital technologies to bring about new paths of creativity and to overcome asynchronism in time and space.

Any contribution to this discursive process is welcome.

200,Teaching circular economics,"Education is our most effective tool when it comes to shaping our future. Take schools during the industrial revolution, they gave children approximately standardised skills in reading, writing and arithmetic that would help to drive a rapidly growing economy and ultimately raise living standards.

The challenges we face today are not simply supplying an industrialising economy with labour, they are environmental - climate change, biodiversity collapse, plastic pollution.

There have been a number of recent calls to introduce the teaching of climate change into the mainstream curriculum. Currently only secondary geography and chemistry touch upon the issue, but campaigners would like to see it become a core subject, possibly even constituting part of the primary curriculum.

Children care about what is happening to our planet. Earlier this year, the YouthStrike4Climate protests saw over 15,000 children march in more than 60 towns and cities across the UK.

But just like climate change has caught the attention of children, so has plastic pollution. Schools up and down the country have engaged in the issues by writing letters to politicians and business urging them to take action.

The images from David Attenborough’s Blue Planet series made the whole world sit up and take notice, but the biggest impact has been on young people. Children feel strongly about this issue and we should help them to tackle this problem.

However, taking on the issue of plastic pollution in schools should not merely be limited to extolling the virtues of recycling. We need to be more dynamic, and this is where circular economics comes in.

A circular economy is one that seeks to establish a system of consumption where materials continuously flow, being used and then reused, with as little waste and negative environmental impact as possible. Biological materials are returned to the environment and technological materials are utilised in a ‘make – use – repair/upgrade’ cycle.

Circular economics is seen as a breakaway from our current linear economic system, whereby resources are used in a ‘make-consume-dispose’ model, with high waste and significant negative environmental impact. It seeks to make our societies less wasteful and more resourceful.

So, how would this theory be used in the curriculum? The teaching would begin by looking at our current linear system of consumption, and dealing with the first objective of circular economics, making us less wasteful.

This is not as complicated as it first sounds: it means giving children an understanding of the true cost of making things. For example, the typical pair of jeans requires over 15,000 liters of water in their manufacturing process; plastic bottles take at least 450 years to biodegrade; and, many multi-material objects, such as coffee cups (which are made of both cardboard and plastic) are never recycled.

Properly understanding the impact our consumption has upon the world will help our young people make more sustainable choices when they are older.

Secondly, the teaching would look at how circular economics can help us to be more resourceful. Children would be taught how to better recycle things they have used themselves, or to upcycle things for others to use.

An interesting example of this came earlier this year: the North London Waste Authority has held a series of ‘Repair Cafes’, where people took along worn and damaged items, such as clothes and bikes, and had them repaired by trained specialists.

The participants were then given tutorials on how to undertake future repairs themselves. If we could transfer workshops such as these into schools, children could learn valuable skills whilst doing their bit for the environment.

Teaching circular economics in schools could encompass projects that would lend themselves to the design curriculum. For instance, in Scotland circular economics research and advocacy body, Ostrero, has been running the ‘Making Circles’ initiative, which has sought to get children thinking about reusing waste materials.

The project saw children taking part in a ‘Circular Economy Design Challenge’, where participants submitted designs for items made from disposed objects.

Last year a large number of schools in the Netherlands took part in the Clean2Antarctica project, which saw children collecting and sorting plastics that would be used to make a vehicle that will eventually travel to the South Pole.

What’s more, projects such as these also develop children’s creative and collaborative skills – two of the 4Cs of twenty-first xentury learning (areas identified as being essential to the future of education).

The potential impact that circular economic thinking could have on our education system is profound. It could help us to nurture future generations with more sustainable mindsets, and the tools with which to help our planet. But its potential will not be unlocked unless we want it to be.

We should not omit key world challenges from our curriculum, and merely hope that some children find a vocation in tackling them sometime later in their life. We should actively engage young people in the problems our planet faces.

Children care greatly about the problems facing our environment, as we have seen this year with the schoolchildren’s climate protests across the UK and Europe, and with their thousands and thousands of letters campaigning against plastic pollution.

They want to do something; they certainly have the passion; and, they undoubtedly have the potential to make a real difference.

As teachers it is our job to empower them to take on the great challenges of their day.

201,Professions in fashion created by social issues and the circular economy,"Is sustainability and a circular economy the future of the fashion industry? As the ‘Big Four Fashion Weeks’ from New York to Paris wrap up, the hottest topics on the runways this season has become eco-fashion, climate concerns and animal rights. In the midst of the Global Climate Strike and the Climate March led by 16-year-old Greta Thunberg, Kering announced its commitment to full carbon neutrality with LVMH following suit shortly after. Meanwhile, companies such as H&M boycotted Brazilian leather as a result of the Amazon fires. With social and environmental issues now at the forefront of the fashion industry, FashionUnited asked four professionals at the helm of sustainability and social impact what their job entails and how they use their power to affect change.

What exactly does a Sustainability Expert do?

A Sustainability Expert challenges what we do today and asks is there a better way, an approach which achieves the same outcome but at less cost to people and the environment. In the fashion world that requires experience and a full understanding of how to design, source and manufacture a product. The continuous obstacle is how to deliver against your sustainability promise whilst still making profit and giving the customer what they want.

What do you love about your job?

When I hear people playing back my words, then I know they have really connected with sustainability. My job as a sustainability expert is to help them by identifying what people really care about, what affects them day-to-day and how even the smallest changes can positively affect their lifestyle and environment, to drive momentum and action change.

Q&A with the Sustainability Expert of Alvanon, Jackie Lewis

What are your responsibilities as the Chief Giving Officer at Toms?

It’s a unique job without a rulebook. While it’s extremely rewarding because I’m passionate about the impact we make, it's challenging too. After all, it's such a critical role within Toms. My job is to strategize and oversee our giving work, making sure that we are making the most impact possible, whether that’s through our shoe and water giving or through our new project-based work that supports local needs. My role entails everything from the ordering to manufacturing, to how the shoes will be stored, to how they will be distributed, to the feedback loop with partners, and analysis of what we can do better. I’m also looking into new projects and local partners, and identifying where we can make a positive impact in the future based on what is needed most.

What does a typical working day look like for you?

My days are long but truly never the same, which I love. I manage our network of around 90 giving partners and our giving programs. My team and I also work on developing the best strategies for our giving, using feedback from our current partners in the field. We feel a strong obligation to give shoes, sight, and water in the most responsible way possible. For example, we now make shoes in a number of different silhouettes to match the climate of the region and activities kids are engaging in. These additions to the product line are a direct result of our giving partner’s feedback. We also make sure to give them shoes, water and sight as part of larger health and education programs, which we’ve found has a greater impact.

The C-suite title of the future? Q&A with Amy Smith, Chief Giving Officer at Toms

Magdalena Schaffrin, Sustainability Agent and the Creative Director of Neonyt (Sustainable) Trade Fair

At the moment, the current discussion about microplastics and plastics in general in the oceans, which of course also affects the textile industry, is attracting a great deal of media attention. In addition, broader alliances have formed up to UN level, which has put the topic of fashion on the agenda for 2019.

If you had all the power for one day, what three problems in the fashion industry would you solve?

First of all, I would improve the working conditions of all people in the textile supply chains. Then I would ban all harmful chemicals and ingredients. Third, I would eliminate excessive consumption so that we all have more time again for the important questions in life and do not spend our time buying new things, managing them and getting rid of them again.

How can one do luxury better?

The crucial point is quality. For me, sustainable aspects such as high-quality materials are a given. I am convinced that it is not possible to speak of good quality when harmful ingredients are used or when people working in the supply chain suffer. The new concept of quality, as I understand it, includes sustainability aspects.

How did you start the company?

I was working as a fashion innovation consultant, researching for lots of big clients such as L’Oréal, Stella McCartney and Adidas, helping them to design products around their customers’ needs. Working with these huge brands showed me that I was much more interested in the way things are made rather than how to sell things.

At first, we thought we’d be more of a marketplace, helping to match brands and factories. We spent two years in India, living in Mumbai, visiting over 200 factories and asking them questions, as we knew the problems we were seeing didn’t exist only for brands. Nobody really asks the factories ‘hey, how are you, guys? If you could improve the process, what would you do?’. So, we went about building relationships with factories which were open-minded and aligned with our values. We specifically looked for factories with between 15-500 employees. Initially, we were just an agent, without a platform, but then we raised investment and built a platform and that’s how we are where we are today: we’re a marketplace production automation tool. But we’re only three years in, so we’re not everything we want to be yet.

What would you say is the thing you’re most proud of?

Transitioning brands which aren’t interested in sustainability to working with organic fabrics and recycled packaging materials because it actually made more sense and it ended up being cheaper than what they were producing.

202,Moving towards a ‘circular economy’,"Cornwall could be at the cutting edge of a transition towards a “circular economy”.

The concept of a circular economy aims to eliminate waste by using and reusing resources rather than throwing them away.

This drastically new form of economy claims benefits for both people and the planet.

At a summit on Wednesday (Sept 25), organised by the Tevi programme, dozens of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as policymakers and academics, discussed how to make Cornwall’s economy more circular and environmentally sustainable.

This work builds on existing regional development approaches focusing on more innovation, resilience and value creation on the local level.

Invited speakers included Professor Peter Hopkinson and Professor Steffen Boehm from the University of Exeter’s Centre for Circular Economy as well as Dr Reg Butterfield, founder of the international consultancy Management Resource Centre based in Austria, and Simone Gager, who runs the design programme for the Amsterdam-based social enterprise Circle Economy.

Tevi (Cornish for “grow”) is an EU-funded project, led by the University of Exeter, to create both economic and environmental growth in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly.

The programme is delivered in partnership with Cornwall Wildlife Trust, Cornwall Council and Cornwall Development Company.

“Ultimately we are trying to delete the concept of waste,” said Tevi project manager Dr Dan Bloomfield.

“Any reasonable assessment of circular economy tells us that Cornwall is in the early stages – a truly circular economy is radically different from how things are now.

“However, compared to other rural areas, we are ahead of the game because we have a dedicated network in Tevi.

“We have the enthusiasm from Cornish businesses, coupled with the academic input, to bring about the circular economy in Cornwall.”

The summit heard from a range of experts from Cornwall and beyond, and participants broke into groups to discuss specific issues and opportunities.

SMEs received practical advice about moving their businesses from the conventional linear to a more circular economy business model.

One recurring theme was the need for a hub or exchange where businesses could list their waste products, to find out if any other business or organisation could make use of them.

In this context, a data-driven approach to both mapping and environmental intelligence lies at the heart of Tevi’s offerings.

“Mapping Cornwall in this way is a really interesting idea,” said investor Chris Gaskell, speaking at the event at Nancarrow Farm near Truro.

“It would really help to get the circular economy going.”

Mike Hooper, of Miscanthus Nursery Ltd, said Tevi was playing a vital role by bringing people together.

“My main drive in life is to create a can-do attitude,” he said.

“You need to get people together to get things done.”

Tracey Dockree, who upcycles unwanted clothes and is developing yarn made from nettles, added: “Cornwall has a really good shot at making something like this work.”",United Kingdom,2019.09
203,Op-ed: Considerations on clean energy,"The apparent abundance and efficiency of fossil fuels revolutionized our energy systems. Research had yet to confirm environmental, health and economic risks, and even when it had, communication was poor. This lack of foresight has led us to the current, established system that resists change despite confirmed harm — sacrificial zones, energy poverty, ecological catastrophe, global warming and climate crisis. Fossil fuels catalyzed the Second Industrial Revolution at the expense of countless communities and regions around the world.

Unsurprisingly, it was the threat of scarcity rather than environmental and ethical issues that started pushing us away from fossil fuels. Research into alternative energy accelerated, with solar as one of the most attractive candidates due to abundant solar irradiance, though this can be limited as there are only so many hours in a day. Moreover, the process of fabricating a solar cell is incredibly material and energy intensive, and there are limited resources on Earth. What do we do once we’ve extracted it all? What do we do when we’re left with nonfunctional solar cells? Experts predict that we would generate 78 million metric tons of photovoltaic waste by 2050 under our current system. It is critical that we consider the full lifetime of a solar cell — from the harvesting of raw materials to methods of waste management. There are limited natural resources on Earth. Confronting this unsettling reality demands the development of more efficient and widely applicable methods to repurpose, remanufacture and recycle materials necessary to renewable energy sources. Namely, a circular economy of energy.

The circular economy model first became popular in the 1970s and has since been championed by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a UK-based charity that promotes and funds circular economy advancements. The current global economy runs in a linear fashion: production, use, waste. A linear economy depletes Earth's raw resources and generates massive waste, a model that is no longer sustainable. In contrast, a circular economy keeps all raw materials within the economy through repair, refurbishment, remanufacture and recycling. Consider a cell phone in a circular economy: Repair would constitute customer care such as replacing the battery; refurbishment would require the manufacturer to replace parts like the screen or camera; remanufacture would take the phone apart to install new hardware; recycling would take the phone apart completely to extract individual materials, such as precious metals, wiring and plastics. Our current economy does not significantly include any of these pathways except recycling. But taking apart products completely is wasteful, needless and energy intensive. Furthermore, recycling in the U.S. is declining since exporting waste is no longer an option and no cost-effective domestic alternatives exist. Radical action is needed to establish a true circular economy. It’s the only way to sustainably minimize waste.

These same principles must be applied to energy systems. Currently, silicon solar cells dominate 90 percent of the solar cell industry. Yet, while silicon is the second most abundant element on Earth, it remains a limited and problematic candidate for solar cell materials. Modern solar cell advancements rely on new materials with better electronic properties but potentially more hazardous materials. Perovskite solar cells, for example, have skyrocketed in efficiencies but often contain lead and other potentially hazardous materials. These hazardous materials demand multiple extractions, refinement and a lengthy period of transportation. These processes elevate the initial carbon footprint of producing solar cells. Furthermore, relying on trace materials has the potential to make us vulnerable to scarcity. Regardless of what material is used for our solar cells, circular economy principles will be key to designing a system that lasts.

Fossil fuels are an empire built on unethical, unsustainable practices that become impossible to correct as the empire grows. Thus, it is critical to investigate sourcing and waste management before committing to a new system. Our desperation to escape disastrous climate change by ditching fossil fuels has the potential to make us reckless and vulnerable. We must hold our industries, scientists, policymakers and energy companies accountable for answering the following questions: How are we mitigating exploitation, emissions and waste? Where will the energy be produced and maintained? How will it affect and support all communities? These are not trivial questions that are far we can ignore while consuming seemingly limitless, cheap, consequence-free energy.

Solar irradiance may be infinite, but the raw materials needed to capture it are not. We cannot continue down a linear economy model, consuming raw materials and producing solar cell waste. There is no future in a linear economy. We must confront resource scarcity and waste generation by demanding a circular economy. Solar cells could make up a sustainable energy system, but they could also become the next fossil fuel disaster. No energy system under a linear economy can succeed.

208,Boost to circular economy as 130 banks with $47 trillion in assets commit to sustainable investment,"Earlier this week, around 200 delegates gathered at the UN General Assembly in New York, which marked the official launch of the Principles for Responsible Banking, and the beginning of a major partnership between the global banking industry and the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI).

At the event, a total of 130 banks - representing more than $47 trillion in assets - signed the Principles for Responsible Banking, a commitment to take a crucial role in helping to achieve a sustainable future.

The principles were developed in recognition of the urgent need for sustainability, and were a joint effort by the UNEP FI and banks including Nordea Bank.

Frank Vang-Jensen, president and group CEO of Nordea, said: “By creating the Principles for Responsible Banking, Nordea and the other founding banks have accomplished a comprehensive framework for banks to collectively address the global sustainability challenges and work towards the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals.

“I am very proud that Nordea has been able to play such an active part in creating the principles and opportunities for a better society. Together we are on a journey towards a sustainable future.”

By signing the Principles for Responsible Banking, the banks are committing to “using our products, services and relationships to support and accelerate the fundamental changes in our economies and lifestyles necessary to achieve shared prosperity for both current and future generations”.

Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary-General, said: “The UN Principles for Responsible Banking are a guide for the global banking industry to respond to, drive and benefit from a sustainable development economy. They create the accountability that can realise responsibility, and the ambition that can drive action”.

The importance of sustainability will be considered at every level of a company from the financing, to investment and advice.

The continuous development of service offerings for consumers to make sustainable choices is considered vital, and includes green mortgages for energy-efficient buildings, green bonds, green corporate loans, and green car loans for electric vehicles.

The six Principles for Responsible Banking are:
• Alignment: Aligning business strategy to contribute to society’s goals, as expressed in the Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Climate Agreement and relevant national and regional frameworks.
• Impact: Continuously increasing the positive impacts on, and managing the risks to, people and the environment resulting from activities, products and services.
• Customers: Working with customers to encourage sustainable practices and enable economic activities.
• Stakeholders: Consulting, engaging and partnering with stakeholders to achieve society’s goals.
• Governance: Effective governance and responsible banking, demonstrating ambition and accountability by setting impactful public targets.
• Accountability: Reviewing the implementation of these Principles and being accountable for the impacts.

The commitment provides a significant boost for the circular economy, which promises to be a global force for good that also creates a new international market worth trillions of dollars.

The circular economy provides a vision of a more sustainable future as companies move away from the historic business model of ‘take-make-waste’ to a new business cycle, where the life of assets is extended through greater utilisation, reuse and recycling.

There is growing momentum for change, amid warnings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that the world must act immediately to avoid an environmental crisis.

For businesses, this means significant change in the coming years, as many countries move towards a zero-carbon economy, where there is less reliance on fossil fuels and a greater focus on sustainable ways of doing business.

Earlier this year, Jaguar Land Rover revealed its investment in a closed loop strategy for its vehicle production to maximise recycling of materials into its next generation models.

The REALITY project will recover aluminium from existing Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles and is being tested on early, pre-production prototypes of the Jaguar I-Pace electric vehicle.

In February, BNP Paribas Leasing Solutions and 3 Step IT announced a European strategic alliance to offer technology leasing solutions and lifecycle management, which will support the circular economy.

The partners will combine their expertise to provide organisations with a complete management service for technology equipment, including consultation, funding, in-life tracking, equipment monitoring and end-of-life management, ranging from data destruction and refurbishment to resale of returned equipment.

The alliance will be effective in the 20 European countries where each of the partners operates, under the name BNP Paribas 3 Step IT.

Swedish furniture giant Ikea has also piloted a leasing service for kitchens and furniture as part of its focus on eliminating waste.

The pilot project in Switzerland is looking at ways for customers to ‘buy, care for and pass on products’ as part of its aim to become a fully circular business by 2030.

A new whitepaper from leading IT services and software company Tieto looks at the role of asset finance companies in the circular economy and features case studies of businesses that are introducing new business models to extend the life of assets and promote recycling and reuse of equipment and resources.
• What role can the circular economy play in asset finance?
• What are the benefits of a business model that supports the circular economy?
• How are asset finance companies adapting to greener ways of working?
• What are the next steps to ensure organisations can benefit from the potential of the circular economy?

Per Dahlqvist, head of business development and analytics products, credit solutions and services at Tieto, said: “The asset finance industry can play a vital role in these new ways of doing business, through funding and by supporting the processes that enable change.”

212,Renewable energy is not enough: Paper highlights what more is needed to reach climate targets,"The Ellen MacArthur Foundation has launched a new paper, in collaboration with Material Economics, revealing the need for a fundamental shift in the global approach to reach climate targets

The UK-based charity, whose mission is to accelerate the transition to a circular economy to tackle the world’s most significant challenges, says it is vital to move beyond the current focus on renewable energy as a solution to climate change.

As set out in Completing the Picture: How the Circular Economy tackles Climate Change, moving to renewables can only address 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions. To achieve UN climate goals, the paper highlights the urgent need to tackle the remaining 45%.

The paper demonstrates the potential of the circular economy in tackling these overlooked emissions. To illustrate this potential, the paper looks at five key areas to demonstrate this – steel, plastic, aluminium, cement and food.

Adopting a circular economy framework in these areas can achieve a reduction totalling 9.3 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2050. This is equivalent to eliminating current emissions from all forms of transport globally.

These examples provide a clear message to other industries – such as fashion, electronics, and packaging – of the value the circular economy can offer.

Diet shift, emerging innovations, and carbon capture and storage are the final pieces required to complete the picture of how the world can achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

By releasing the paper, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation said it sought to bring an important missing piece to climate change solutions, demonstrating how businesses, financial institutions, and policymakers can build a thriving and resilient economy while playing an essential role in combating climate change.

“Switching to renewable energy plays a vital role in addressing climate change, but this alone will not be enough. In order to achieve targets on climate, it is critical that we transform how we design, make, and use products, and food. Completing the picture through a transition to a circular economy can enable us to meet the needs of a growing global population, while creating a prosperous and resilient economy that can run in the long term,” said Dame Ellen MacArthur, founder of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

The Paris Agreement calls for net-zero emissions by 2050 to limit temperature increase to 1.5℃. Whilst the circular economy is underpinned by renewable energy, the paper also demonstrates the crucial role the food sector and key industry sectors can play in reducing emissions to meet that target.

“This paper shows that transitioning to a circular economy is not only an opportunity to tackle emissions across sectors, but to design an economy that is restorative and regenerative, creating benefits for society, businesses, and the environment,” Dame Ellen added.

Christiana Figueres, former Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and Founding Partner, Global Optimism said: “Carbon constraints actually represent huge ingenuity opportunities. That is true for every company, for every city and any country. That is the direction in which we need to move, and this report offers compelling figures to give confidence in our ability to optimize decarbonisation and economic development in mutual support of each other.”

The circular economy is based on three principles: design out waste and pollution, keep products and materials in use, and regenerate natural systems.

In addition to reducing emissions, the paper shows that the circular economy has the potential to increase resilience to the effects of climate change and contribute to the meeting of numerous UN sustainable development goals.

European Investment Bank’s president Dr Werner Hoyer recently commented: “Fighting global warming and environmental crises are the most urgent challenges of our time. Strengthening the circular economy is one of the most powerful tools in our arsenal. It will not only help achieve the Paris Agreement targets but also bring huge benefits for the economy and society.”",United Kingdom,2019.09
215,Digging Deeper,"HOW does the mining industry fit into the emerging new paradigm of the circular economy? After all, it is a sector with a business model that relies on the extraction and processing of finite minerals and metals resources. While waste minimisation can help reduce costs and prevent environmental and social legacy issues in either the near or long term, the traditional view of the mining sector is that it has a ‘take-make-dispose’, or linear economy, approach to its working practices. In trying to answer this question, it is worthwhile to think about how the circular economy is defined and where it is making impact.

While there are several definitions of the circular economy, one commonly-accepted definition is an economy that is restorative and regenerative by design and aims to keep products, components and materials at their highest utility and value at all times as well as accelerating the transition from a conventional linear economy. Supporting this definition is the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s three key principles for advancing the circular economy: design out waste and pollution; keep products and materials in use; and regenerate natural systems. This will, it suggests, promote gradual decoupling of economic activity from the consumption of finite resources, and designing waste out of the system. In doing so, economic, natural, and social capital will be built through the circular model1.

In Europe there has been a substantive drive towards developing a circular economy, driven to a degree by a concern of security of supply of raw materials. China’s circular economy initiative is effectively a sustainable consumption and production programme. It utilises approaches in cleaner production, industrial ecology, and life cycle management to balance the demands of maintaining rapid economic growth with enhancing environmental quality and continuing social progress. In Australia, state governments have created circular economy initiatives with an emphasis on waste management and recycling in response to both global and national challenges.

An indication of the advancement of the concept is the relatively recent development by the British Standards Institution (BSI) of the first circular economy standard, BS 8001:2017. It provides a practical framework and guidance for organisations implementing the principles of the circular economy2. Furthermore, the European Commission is also undertaking a range of actions to support the move to a more circular economy, including specific actions for critical raw materials such as platinum group metals, rare earth elements, cobalt, coking coal, and magnesium. To progress this initiative, a report has been released on key data sources, best practices and options for further circular economy action at an EU level for raw materials3.",United Kingdom,2019.09
220,The Raw and Circular Economy Expedition gathered sustainability pioneers to unlock solutions to making mobility sustainable for Europe,"Because EIT RawMaterials and the RACE believes diversity is an enabling element for creativity and development of innovative solutions to pressing global challenges, a diverse group of 70 students was selected from approximately 180 applications. The RACE 2019 students represented 27 nationalities, achieved a 50:50 gender ratio and brought together students with interdisciplinary disciplines including geology, mining engineering, materials sciences, resources management, chemical engineering, industrial ecology and even sustainable tourism and naval engineering.

The RACE 2019 incorporated a mix of pedagogic elements to maximize learning, including expert lectures, study tours and group work activities on a start-up solution to be pitched to a RACE Jury. Students received more than 10 lectures from leading experts in industry, academia and policy on topics related digitalization, mineral economics and business models to societal and regulatory aspects.

At the same time, RACE 2019 students were able to see first-hand the operations of European excellences:
• Europe’s only chromite mine from Showcase Partner Outokumpu in Kemi, Finland
• Remanufacturing, recycling and disassembly operations at Audi in Ingolstadt, Germany
• Concentration plant and sampling operations at the Umicore Precious Metals refinery in Hoboken, Belgium.

Finally, the seven student teams harnessed their own disciplinary knowledge, but also incorporated knowledge and learning obtained from the 10 expert lectures, three study tours and continuous networking to develop a business solution to the five RACE 2019 Future Mobility Challenges, which were sourced from the Industrial Showcase Partners. Several of the RACE 2019 challenges were broad, enabling student teams to think far outside the box, leveraging their creativity and design solutions which could be disruptive, revolutionary and with a potentially large impact. Other RACE 2019 Challenges were more concrete, closer to case studies and real challenges, with a clear and more targeted problem definition. RACE 2019 Challenges covered the entire Future Mobility and raw materials value chain, such as:
• Develop solutions to ensure primary raw materials for electric vehicles and energy storage applications
• Proposal to OEMs along the supply chain to increase the number and length of life cycles of batteries or keeping the material in the loop trough remanufacturing, reuse and recycling
• Strategies for municipalities to optimise the use of energy from electric vehicles/batteries (supply) for non-transportation applications requiring energy (demand), particularly at times when electric vehicles are not in use and/or not needed (supply).

On the final day, all seven RACE teams pitched their business solutions and start-up ideas to a RACE Jury comprising Industrial Showcase Partners and EIT RawMaterials Business Development Managers. Pitches were evaluated and the top three pitches were selected and will automatically move to Phase 2 of the EIT RawMaterials business creation vehicle for early-stage idea holders – the EIT Jumpstarter. The top three pitches were:
• 3rd Place: AIExplore – Using artificial intelligence to make exploration more cost-efficient
• 2nd Place: e-Fold – Proving e-bikes and service which uses re-purposed batteries
• 1st Place: Chargicle – Making electric vehicles more reliable using second-hand batteries for on-demand, on-site charging",European Union,2019.09
221,Circular economy 'fundamental' for net zero by 2050,"A circular economy approach is required in combination with renewable energy to meet net-zero emissions by 2050, according to a report.

Renewable energy is able to account for a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, but the remaining 45%, generated by manufacturing everyday consumables, is being “overlooked”, said the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF).

The report, Completing the Picture: How the Circular Economy Tackles Climate Change, outlined practical solutions through adopting the circular economy across production of cement, plastics, steel, aluminium, and food, which could cut 9.3bn tonnes of emissions.

“By 2050, the global demand for industry materials such as steel, cement, aluminium, and plastics will increase by two to fourfold, while global food demand is estimated to increase by 42%,” said the report. Therefore, global emissions will exceed the amount allowed to meet the Paris agreement temperature limit of 1.5C by 2050, regardless of energy efficiencies and green sources.

A systematic transformation of how industries “design, produce and use goods” is essential to reducing production emissions.

Philip Selwood, chief executive of the Energy Saving Trust and trustee of the EMF, said: “The paper highlights that a system-led approach is essential and actions that mitigate climate impacts and build resilience are critical to the delivery of future emissions targets.”

The circular economy can make up almost half of the 45% gap, while the use of emerging technology, innovation, carbon capture storage, and diet shift will be needed to create further emission cuts.

Food production is highlighted as an area that would benefit from producing and managing food resources through a circular approach. There is a potential reduction in emissions of 5.6bn tonnes by 2050. This would involve transition to food system models around “designing out waste, keeping products and materials in use and regenerating natural land”.

Cross sector and intergovernmental efforts between international institutions, governments, businesses, and investors will be vital to make the circular economy framework achievable, according to the report.

Each body plays a key role, such as institutions encouraging the circular economy on the international agenda of climate change, policymakers incentivising and taking action through policies and collaboration and direct integration into government plans. Also, businesses can support pilot projects and innovations to develop proven concept in industries, and investors can fund and scale up opportunities.

Meanwhile, a report by sustainability media organisation Edie has investigated how the utilities sector can reduce carbon emissions, including leveraging the roles of sustainability and energy professionals to achieve net-zero carbon by 2050.

Luke Nicholls, content director at Edie, said in the report: “Britain's utilities sector has a golden opportunity to position itself at the forefront of the net-zero revolution.

“With the right support and direction, energy and water suppliers large and small can deliver transformative systems that radically reduce carbon whilst enabling and empowering their customers to do the same.”

Separately, Kering, the parent company of Alexander McQueen and Balenciaga, has been analysing its emissions impact across its whole supply chain since 2011. This has allowed the company to create tailored supply chain efficiency programmes, including improved best practices and sustainability requirements for raw materials and manufacturing processes and conversions to renewable energy to meet goals of 100% renewable energy in over seven countries.

Last week Gucci, a subsidiary of Kering, also made an announcement about going carbon neutral by 2040.

Meanwhile, logistics firm Kuehne and Nagel will offer carbon neutral transport options by 2020 through “proactively addressing the CO2 footprint of the transportation services performed by its suppliers – airlines, shipping lines and haulage companies”.

The company will also use technology to create efficient routes and reduce emissions of cargo shipments and offset carbon emissions by supporting reforestation and environmental protection projects.

223,"Net-zero not possible without circular economy, Ellen MacArthur Foundation finds","Net-zero not possible without circular economy, Ellen MacArthur Foundation finds

Focusing on decarbonising the energy sector alone will not put the world within touching distance of a net-zero carbon economy, according to a new report from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation which claims that the transition to a circular economy is also vital.

The Completing the Picture: How the Circular Economy tackles Climate Change report, published by the Foundation (EMF), in collaboration with Material Economics, found that moving to renewables across the globe will only address 55% of greenhouse gas emissions. To tackle the remaining 45%, the paper notes that transitioning to close-loop value chains, diet shift, emerging innovations and carbon capture and storage are all required.

The report examined the role of the circular economy in tackling overlooked emissions, namely in the production of steel, plastic, aluminium, cement and food. According to the report, keeping products and materials in use can reduce emissions per sector by up to 40%. In the food system, regenerative farming and designing out waste can reduce emissions as part of a circular economy by 49%.

Overall, the report suggests that adopting a circular economy framework across those production areas would achieve emissions reductions totalling 9.3bn tonnes - equivalent to eliminating current emissions from all forms of transport globally.

“Switching to renewable energy plays a vital role in addressing climate change, but this alone will not be enough. In order to achieve targets on climate, it is critical that we transform how we design, make, and use products, and food. Completing the picture through a transition to a circular economy can enable us to meet the needs of a growing global population, while creating a prosperous and resilient economy that can run in the long term,” said Dame Ellen MacArthur, founder of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

“This paper shows that transitioning to a circular economy is not only an opportunity to tackle emissions across sectors, but to design an economy that is restorative and regenerative, creating benefits for society, businesses, and the environment.”

The EMF hopes that the report provides a clear message for other industries that traditionally operate within a linear economy of take, make and dispose, such as fashion, electronics and packaging.

The report references the need to reach net-zero by 2050, as outlined in the IPCC Special Report document. That report warns that the world is already 1C warmer than pre-industrial levels, and that an increase to 2C would significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. The report predicts that if the world can become carbon-neutral by 2047, we will have a 66% chance of meeting the most ambitious end of the Paris Agreement pledge.

Commenting on the report, Christiana Figueres, former Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and Founding Partner, Global Optimism said: ""Carbon constraints actually represent huge ingenuity opportunities. That is true for every company, for every city and any country.

“That is the direction in which we need to move, and this report offers compelling figures to give confidence in our ability to optimize decarbonisation and economic development in mutual support of each other.”

The findings of the EMF report build on the suggestions of a report released at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos in January, which outlined the urgent need for nations to ""wake up to the potential"" of the circular economy in order to push the world towards the Paris Agreement's more ambitious pathway.

The Circularity Gap Report 2019, released by non-profit Circle Economy, which consists of a member community of businesses including Arup, ING and VF Corp. The report notes that most governments are failing to consider circular economy policies in order to limit global warming to 1.5C.

The report notes that just 9% of the global economy is considered circular, meaning that less than 10% of the 92.8 billion tonnes of material extracted for use is reused annually. With global material use more than tripling since the 1970s – and set to double again by 2050 – Circle Economy is advising governments to rethink approaches to resource use in select sectors.

241,French parliament to mull law to cut consumer waste,"France’s parliament will from Tuesday (25 September) debate legislation seeking to move the country closer to its ambition of a low-waste future, forcing electronics firms to use second-hand materials and cutting down on plastic refuse.

France, with its population of nearly 70 million, is a voracious consumer of natural resources, producing five tonnes of waste per person per year, according to the environment ministry.

The French Senate will begin three days of discussion on the bill before it is handed to the lower house of parliament, the National Assembly, where President Emmanuel Macron’s government has a large majority.

The legislation would compel computer and cellphone repair shops to use second-hand materials, and oblige industries — including manufacturers of toys, building materials, cigarettes and cleaning products — to manage the waste these products generate as well as their packaging.

The law would also compel manufacturers to provide consumers, beginning in 2021, with information on how their newly-purchased product can be repaired.

In a report last year titled “Roadmap for the Circular Economy”, the French government outlined plans to halve the amount of non-hazardous waste sent to landfills by 2025.

“The situation is clear: France has a long way to go… In 2014, the rate of recovery of household and similar waste was 39% — much lower than our German (65%) or Belgian (50%) neighbours,” the report said.

“The rest, half of which is organic waste, is therefore incinerated or landfilled, which leads to local environmental pollution and energy waste that is incompatible with our climate objectives” of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from burning oil and coal.

Only about a fifth of plastic was recycled, said the report — lower than the European Union average of 30% or Scandinavian countries with more than 90%.

The French use about 47,000 tonnes of discardable cleaning wipes every year, and destroy some €650 million worth of unsold, non-food products.

The government has pitched the bill as crucial to the drive to create a so-called “circular economy” in which used products are fixed, reused, or recycled.

But not all are convinced.

“Sure, there are positive measures… but nothing to address the upstream, to avoid the generation of waste nor the overuse of packaging,” said centrist senator Hervé Maurey.

The research foundation Tara Ocean, in an open letter signed by numerous scientists, said the only way to turn the tide on plastic was to introduce a bottle return scheme.

Green parties surged across Europe in European elections in June, not least in France where the EELV party came third with 13.5% of the vote.

In January, France’s junior environment minister Brune Poirson promised a law to tackle waste after a television documentary showed Amazon destroying millions of products that had been returned by consumers.

British fashion firm Burberry also caused a furore last year by acknowledging it had burned unsold clothes, accessories and perfume worth £28.6 million (€23 million) annually to prevent them being sold off cheaply.

Macron has sought to portray himself as a friend of the Green movement, especially in the fight against climate change.

244,Transitioning to a green economy: Is carbon offsetting the answer?,"When it comes to transitioning to a green economy and carbon offsetting, William Richardson, Founder and Managing Director of Green Element provides his thoughts

According to studies performed by the Economist Intelligence Unit, a rise in global temperatures of six degrees (which is the worst-case scenario) would inflict $43 trillion of losses on investment portfolios. This is around 30% of the entire stock of manageable assets.

Consequently, a transition to an inclusive green economy is vital. In 2008 the UN created the Green Economy Initiative, aimed at encouraging governments to invest in protecting our environment. They defined the ‘green economy as one that results in improved human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities.’

In order to achieve a green economy, the UN encouraged a focus on; ‘circularity, collaboration, solidarity, resilience, opportunity and interdependence.’

During the past decade, there has been a focus on the circularity element. The concept of moving away from the linear economy to the circular economy has been prevalent. Traditionally, our economic model was based on the linear approach. In other words; take, make and dispose. We would recklessly extract precious materials from the ground, make them into products (which had a short life span) and then we would landfill the items when we no longer wanted them. These used items were claimed to be worthless.

However, we know this is far from the truth. Items made from precious materials, extracted from the ground are finite. They have a lot of value.

This is where the circular economy comes in. The idea that we must consider the end of life process of items being manufactured. The circular economy is based on a model which instead of land-filling products saves them.

Not only is less waste better for the environment but it is also better for our economy. Businesses that recycle save costs on extraction. For example, recycling one ton of iPhones will yield 300 times more gold than extracting one ton of gold ore.

Other aspects of the green economy involve investing in environmental projects. For example, carbon offsetting enables companies or governments to buy carbon credits. This means that carbon emitted can be balanced out by carbon credits purchased. In this way, a company or country can be deemed ‘carbon neutral’ without having to actually stop emitting carbon dioxide.

In theory, a company can emit as many tonnes of carbon dioxide as they like but if they buy back the number of tonnes emitted, they can write on their website they are carbon neutral. Transitioning to a low carbon economy in this way is not necessarily the answer.

 In order to avoid financial and environmental disaster, we need to ensure that the green economy is executed efficiently.",United Kingdom,2019.09

You begin in the same way they design their clothes – at the end. But in true circular economy fashion, the end is just the beginning of the story... “I know, we’ll write your first piece of code, that will be fun,” says Mart Drake-Knight, the 32-year-old co-founder of the fashion tech company that is set to transform the industry as we know it. I’ve been well and truly “Marted”, as one of his employees describes it later.



A tour of the Teemill factory on the Isle of Wight usually takes around half an hour; by the time we’re coding at the boardroom table, handmade from salvaged materials, we’re already an hour-and-a-half late for lunch and I’m just learning that every programmer’s first line of code starts with those two little words: “hello world”.

The paper reveals the need for a fundamental shift in the global approach to tackling climate change.

Moving to renewables can only address 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions. To achieve UN climate goals, the paper highlights the urgent need to tackle the remaining 45%, and demonstrates the potential of the circular economy by looking at five key areas - steel, plastic, aluminium, cement, and food.

Adopting a circular economy framework in these areas can achieve a reduction totalling 9.3 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2050. This is equivalent to eliminating current emissions from all forms of transport globally. These examples provide a clear message to other industries – such as fashion, electronics, and packaging – of the value the circular economy can offer.

Diet shift, emerging innovations, and carbon capture and storage are the final pieces required to complete the picture of how the world can achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

266,What is a circular economy and how does it work? | Living,"With Zero Waste Week just gone and theories of sustainability being implemented across London Fashion Week, you’re likely to have seen all sorts of articles and adverts asking you to think about whether what you do or don’t buy is helping to support a ‘circular economy’.

To the initiated its old news, but for the vast majority of people, it’s probably not a term that's found its way into their everyday vocabulary. It is really difficult to make a change to your shopping habits when you don’t know exactly what you are meant to be changing or how being in the know might help you to buy more sustainably.

Don’t worry, we’ve got your back. We’re taking it back to basics to help you learn exactly what a circular economy is and how you can support change with what you do and don’t buy.

What do we have now?

“The fashion business model is currently oriented around the goal of selling as many products as possible, and for a significant part of the industry, at the lowest possible price” the C&A Foundation explained to Euronews Living, “ it is largely a linear system that involves the extraction of virgin materials coupled with manufacturing carried out at such low cost that it often translates into unacceptable working conditions and environmental degradation”.

The C&A Foundation works towards a fair and sustainable fashion future by changing this system so that it makes the most of the resources it harvests addressing all kinds of issues with both sustainability and ethical production.

A ‘linear’ economy produces an incredible amount of waste as resources are only used once. All of this single-use waste goes to landfill whilst new materials are turned into new products and packaging putting a strain on the world’s resources. It's essentially a big conveyor belt going straight into the bin.

This way of using resources hasn’t been all bad. Linear economies have helped to create jobs, increase our quality of life, and reduce mortality rates. This model does, however, rely on the assumption that there will always be resources to turn into the products we need and that there always be somewhere to put our waste. It's becoming abundantly clear that this just isn’t true.

As the world’s population has increased this has become less and less true. In the 1760s, at the dawn of the First Industrial Revolution, the United Nations estimates that there were less than a billion people on the planet. There are now nearly 8 billion people using those same resources and throwing them away at an alarming rate. Resource management expert, WRAP, states that by 2050 it is estimated that the planet will be home to nine billion people; we would need nearly three planet Earths to provide for all those people if we continue consuming at the same rate as we do now.

When it comes to fashion, it's often worse than just creating clothing to keep up with this incredible demand according to the C&A Foundation:

“Take a single t-shirt as an example. Currently, virgin material will be extracted and then continue to manufacturing. Both processes use a huge amount of resources and generate waste in the form of water, energy, chemicals, and materials. Once the material has become a t-shirt, there is like to be even more waste. Many brands produce an oversupply, meaning that some of these t-shirts are disposed of (incinerated, landfilled, or shredded) instead of sold. Others may be worn a few times and then either just lay forgotten in the back of a closet or simply discarded while consumers go out to buy more. And the process continues.”

In 2017, 58 million tonnes of municipal waste went to landfill in the European Union, the European Commission found. With information coming to light earlier this year that some waste exported to developing countries for recycling might also be going to landfill, this could be even more than official figures account for. Even the fact that this waste is being sent abroad shows that space is running out to store the things we throw away.

So how does thinking with circles help? In a circular economy, the full potential of a resource is explored and it is kept in use for as long as possible. Often this potential is wasted or locked away when we shove our unworn t-shirt to the back of the wardrobe never to see the light of day again until it's tossed unceremoniously in the trash.

It starts even before you find yourself staring with desire at the fourth little black dress you’ve bought this month at the design stage. Planned obsolescence is an obstacle those of us looking to consume less are constantly at war with. From electronics to cars to clothing; manufacturers continuously release updated products to tempt us into buying more. Fast fashion is a great example where new trends are engineered to make us feel like we’re being left behind before we’ve even worn what we’ve already bought.

By designing a product to last longer, be repaired and potentially even find other uses outside of its primary one, circularity can be introduced right from the beginning. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that encourages people to embrace a circular economy, has a particularly good comparison with the natural resource cycle of the planet. Things grow, are eaten, then die returning the resources they used to the natural world to be used again. This natural cycle is the inspiration for how a circular economy might work: “The idea of feedback, of cycles in real-world systems, is ancient and has echoes in various schools of philosophy,” the foundation writes.

Returning to the familiar t-shirt example, how would that previously resource-draining item be made if things were a bit less linear?

“A circular system would see that same t-shirt being made from non-virgin and safe materials and it would allow that t-shirt to circulate in multiple cycles, unlocking the embedded value of the product. The t-shirt would be manufactured using non-virgin materials, without harmful toxins, and would be designed to easily be reused as a garment or disassembled.”

There’s more to circularity than just this though and altering the way we think about the things we buy can even be profitable to the companies that adopt these new business models. Resale, reuse and repair are all ways that demand for new clothing can be reduced according to the C&A Foundation.

“With resale, there is potential to displace new purchase– if people can access enough pre-owned items, and if this process is managed and encouraged by brands. We could see a decreased demand for new products, while the businesses continue to have positive financial results.

“With repair, when brands begin to champion the restoration of their own items (as some high-quality sporting goods already do) they not only increase their brand loyalty, the consumer is able to access repairs from a reputable source and save money.

“In the case of subscription models, consumers are guaranteed that they can return used products to the brand, and get an update to their product while the brand takes the responsibility to repair, resell, donate, recycle, etc.”

The aim is, instead of trying to sell more individual items, to look to sell uses of those items. Rather than research and development being driven by the desire to always buy the newest item, a less linear life will be built into a product from the start.",France,2019.09

289,Ellen MacArthur Foundation chief executive to speak about circular design at Day,"Andrew Morlet, chief executive of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, will speak at Dezeen Day about how architects and designers can help transform the global economy from a linear model to a circular one.

Morlet will explain the foundation's mission to ""inspire a generation to re-think, re-design and build a positive future circular economy"".

He joins a growing list of speakers at Dezeen Day, our international architecture and design conference taking place in London on 30 October.

The circular economy is an economic system that generates no waste or pollution, with materials being reused again and again rather than used once and thrown away. It also works in harmony with nature, nurturing natural systems rather than exploiting them or degrading them.

Founded by former round-the-world sailor Ellen MacArthur, the foundation recently called for 20 million designers to sign up to its circular design programme and make circularity ""the new normal"".

In an exclusive interview with Dezeen earlier this year, MacArthur said that designers were ""absolutely vital"" to the push to dismantle the wasteful and destructive linear economy.

Before joining the foundation, Morlet was a consultant strategy partner at McKinsey & Company, Andersen Consulting and Accenture. Prior to that he worked in medical research focused on HIV/AIDS epidemiology.

Dezeen Day takes place at BFI Southbank in central London on 30 October. The international conference aims to set the agenda for architecture and design. It will discuss topics including design education, future cities and post-plastic materials.

Speakers include Paola Antonelli, Benjamin Hubert, Dara Huang and Patrik Schumacher. See all the speakers that have been announced so far.

297,Extending the life of electronics by a year equivalent to taking millions of cars off the road,"Extending the lifespan of smartphones and other electronics by just one year would slash annual carbon emissions in Europe by the equivalent of taking 2 million cars off the road, a new study reveals.

Experts have assessed the climate benefits of making Europe’s smartphones, notebooks, washing machines and vacuum cleaners more durable in support of the circular economy.

The study found that extending the lifetime of the EU’s stock of these products by five years would save almost 10 million tonnes of emissions annually by 2030, equivalent to taking 5 million cars off the roads for a year.

A one-year extension would result in 4 million tonnes of emissions savings annually.

Researchers at the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) say vast amounts of energy and resources are involved in producing and distributing new products as well as disposing of old ones.

The climate impact of the so-called non-use phases is often overlooked in product policy, with legislation focused on reducing the energy needed to power goods rather than on their production.

If embedded emissions are included, the EU hasn’t achieved any emissions reductions since 1990, the EEB says.

For smartphones in Europe alone, their lifecycle is responsible for 14 million tonnes of emissions each year. Increasing their lifetime by just one year would save more than 2 million tonnes of emissions.

The average lifespan of a smartphone in Europe is three years, with annual sales of almost 211 million units. Laptops last about six years, while washing machines and vacuum cleaners 11.4 and 6.5 respectively.

The report was published today by the EEB on behalf of the Coolproducts and Right to Repair campaigns.

The Right to Repair movement aims to counter planned obsolescence, the practice whereby products are poorly designed and too difficult to repair, so they are prematurely replaced.

Researchers say the proportion of defective devices being replaced by consumers grew from 3.5% in 2004 to 8.3% in 2012.

Jean-Pierre Schweitzer, policy officer for the circular economy at the EEB, said: “This study is further proof that Europe can’t meet its climate obligations without addressing our production and consumption patterns. The climate impact of our disposable smartphone culture is far too high. We can't afford to keep replacing them every few years. We need products that last longer and can be repaired if they break.

“As public support for longer lasting products and climate action grows, we have an opportunity to radically rethink the way our products are designed and produced.”

Coolproducts is a coalition of NGOs led by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and the European Environmental Citizens Organisation for Standardisation (ECOS), which campaigns for better product policy for EU citizens and the environment.

The EEB is Europe’s largest network of environmental organisations with more than 140 members in 30 countries. ECOS is the only European NGO focusing on environmental standards.

The research comes as millions of people around the world hold protests demanding action to reduce pollution in a bid to combat climate change, amid fears global warming will lead to environmental collapse, global flooding and food shortages.

At the International Asset Finance Network conference last year, industry experts argued that the linear economy is dying, ending the 'take, make, waste' cycle, as the rise of the sharing economy will see much more intensive use of assets by multiple clients, enabled through innovations in software.

Carmen Ene, chief executive officer of 3 Step IT, which provides sustainable IT lifecycle management, said: “It is an enormous opportunity for the leasing industry to portray itself as the enabler of the circular economy, as the ones that make all these things possible on an underlying financing contract.”

IT services and software company Tieto recently launched a whitepaper to look at the impact of the circular economy on asset finance.

Per Dahlqvist, head of business development and analytics products, credit solutions and services at Tieto, said: “The asset finance industry can play a vital role in these new ways of doing business, through funding and by supporting the processes that enable change.”",United Kingdom,2019.09

309,Circular Fashion project drives FW brand launch,"The Circular Fashion Fast Forward project, a partnership with the London Waste and Recycling Board (LWARB) and circular economy business consultancy QSA Partners, has helped launch a new circular outdoor clothing brand.

The new FW brand – pronounced ""forward"" – is from Full Stack Supply Co, one of a number of companies including Ted Baker that are working with LWARB and QSA on the project, funded by the C&A Foundation as a part of its Bridging the Gap initiative.

FW's new range has been designed to help put an end to throw-away consumerism, emphasising durable, high-quality construction and materials to ensure the garments last and last.

The real innovation, however, results from a tailored business model developed by LWARB and QSA that means customers will be able to repair their clothing if needed. Through a dedicated service designed to make clothes last longer, customers will have the option of having garments repaired for free within a warranty period. Repairs will still be available to customers at a low cost beyond the warranty period.

A repair service is one of several models companies may integrate into their business to create more value and profit, while reducing their environmental impact. Repairing products helps to keep them in use for longer and builds loyalty with the customer. By repairing every garment it can, FW is selling clothes that could be worn for life. This is an important move away from the usual practice of simply disposing of clothes when they become damaged.

""The business model advice from LWARB and QSA has been essential,"" says Olivia Herbert, head of operations at FW. ""It has helped us to understand the circular models that best fit with our rapidly-growing business and our high performance, forward-thinking apparel for alpine living.""

Andrea Crump, project lead for Circular Fashion Fast Forward, adds: ""The aim of our project is to demonstrate how the circular economy can help brands to hit their environmental and economic targets and succeed in today's marketplace. We are working with several market players across the fashion sector to illustrate the competitive advantage of circular business models.

326,The EU should foster true circular business models,"Aluminium is by nature a circular and thus permanent material: whether it’s in a car, a building or a single beverage can, aluminium is fully and infinitely recyclable, maintaining its original properties no matter how many times it is processed and used. Furthermore, recycling aluminium saves 95% of the energy used in primary production and achieves an equivalent reduction in CO2 emissions.

Roberta Niboli is CEO at Raffmetal and Vice-Chair of European Aluminium.

There is a strong recycling business in Europe with over 220 recycling plants, many of which are small and medium-sized enterprises and family-owned businesses. About 8 million tonnes of scrap is recycled in Europe each year, which includes process and run-around scrap.

The European recycling industry has the potential to grow significantly. Our Vision 2050 report shows that in the coming decades, demand for aluminium will remain strong. With supportive policies for our sector by 2050, recycled aluminium and primary aluminium are expected to meet almost equal shares of total European aluminium demand, which is forecasted to reach around 18 million tonnes.

We understand that this growth must go hand in hand with decarbonisation. With impressive aluminium recycling rates of over 90% in transport and building and about 65% in packaging, the European aluminium industry is already making a significant contribution to the circular economy. 75% of all the aluminium ever produced is still in use today.

To achieve 100% recycling of all aluminium containing products, however, we must maximise the collection and improve the sorting of valuable resources from the end of life of products. EU legislation will have a significant role to play in realising this ambition In our recent I+ Manifesto, we have highlighted our main recommendations to policy makers.

One flagship measure is to encourage smart design to make traceability, disassembly and recycling easier and more cost-efficient. Sorting should preferably be done by specific product and by alloy family. It implies higher investments in modern waste treatment centres, using the latest sorting technologies, including sensor-based and robot sorting systems.

The review of Waste Shipment Regulation is a golden opportunity to simplify the shipment of waste across the EU. One of the changes should be adding new green listed codes for waste where needed, for example for coated or uncoated windows, doors, curtain walls, and other framing profiles which mainly consist of aluminium and plastic. Bureaucracy should not provide additional hurdles for European recycling plants.

Europe should also find efficient ways to address the issue of scrap leaving the European Union. Around one million tonnes of aluminium scrap is exported to non-European countries, and around four million End of Live Vehicles (ELVs) per year are deregistered without a certificate of destruction, probably being illegally exported. The upcoming revision of the ELV Directive should fight against the illegal exports of ELVs by introducing an improved registration/deregistration system. It should also keep the focus on waste prevention and high recycling ambitions. Besides, to ensure high quality recycling, scrap exported out of Europe should be treated by recycling facilities complying with Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) standards equivalent to the ones we have in Europe.

Last but not least, the possible interface between chemical, product and waste legislation should ensure that the use of raw materials such as aluminium will not be jeopardised. Chemicals policy should prefer the risk-based approach rather than hazard as a measure of exposure.

We expect the next European Commission to adopt a Circular Economy Action Plan 2.0 within the first 100 days of its mandate and hope to see our recommendations integrated into this new plan. Of course, there is also a clear role for our industry to further increase and optimise the recycling of aluminium through, for example, design for recycling, closer collaboration with the value chain and promoting the responsible use and consumption of aluminium whether from primary or recycled sources. All solutions that keep aluminium in the loop are worthwhile to consider because the metal we preserve today will likely remain in service forever.",Belgium,2019.09

Packaging alone generates 141 million tonnes annually of single-use plastic waste, being responsible for almost half of global plastic waste. This is the sector which also uses the most plastic: 146 million tonnes per year, representing 42 percent of the global total.

The innovative and unique concept of building roads made of plastic contributes to solving the overwhelming problem of plastic pollution. The idea of plastic roads was conceived by looking at the problems that municipalities, provinces, regional water authorities and contractors deal with on a daily basis including societal problems such as plastic waste, extreme precipitation, consolidation of the subsoil, an increasing need for mobility, and a crowded subsurface as well as the increasingly stringent requirements for future roads.

The increasing demand for more functionality from roads began to raise the question of whether the traditional asphalt is still the answer to these increasingly stringent requirements.

If roads in smart cities should have an increasingly longer lifespan, shorter construction and maintenance time, be more sustainable, achieve ever-higher noise reductions, and also be financially competitive then roads made of plastic is what ticks all the boxes and what inspired the idea of the PlasticRoad initiative.

Zwolle: Historical, trendy, and home of the world's first plastic road

Zwolle is a city west from Amsterdam, reachable by train in just one hour. Zwolle is both historical and trendy. The city hosts one of the biggest markets in The Netherlands with 450 stalls. Art works from Dutch painters Vincent van Gogh and Piet Mondriaan delight art lovers who visit the Museum of Fundatie.

It is here, in Zwolle, where the world's first plastic road prototype was built using recycled single-use plastic.

The first internal trial was ready in 2016. For over a year, cars and small trucks drove over the small plastic road every day without presenting any difficulties. Finally, in 2018, Zwolle became the first official city in the world to have a truly plastic road.

The Netherlands is well known for its heavy use of bicycles that populate the Dutch cities contributing to the promotion of clean and fresh air, daily exercise, and less general pollution.

On September 11, 2018, a 30-meter bike path opened to the public in Zwolle. The road includes sensors which collect data proving information for further development, space for services to run underneath, and its own stormwater management system.

Building the plastic road presented many advantages including cheaper materials than traditional road-building materials and less time required for complexion before the road was fully installed.

The video below shows how the plastic road was installed:

After the success of the first plastic road, a second one was installed in late 2018 in the city of Giethoorn, also in The Netherlands. In this occasion, the goal was to test how the plastic road responded in weak soil conditions.

PlasticRoads plans on building more bike paths, pedestrian areas, and car parks around other cities in The Netherlands. Looking into the future, the three PlasticRoad partners are planning on building urban highways made of plastic.

In the future, single-use plastic might become a thing of the past. Presently, consumers use 500 billion single-use plastic bags per year with 75 percent of post consumer plastic waste being sent to a landfill.

It takes 10 years to 1,000 years for a single-use plastic bag to decompose. Plastic bottles take 450 years, in many cases it could take even more than that. Think all the plastic bottles you have discarded in your whole life will still be around polluting the planet centuries after you die.
• It is a lightweight prefabricated construction that can be built pretty much the LEGO way. It is four times lighter than a traditional road structure
• Higher quality and a longer lifespan. It is homogeneous and prefabricated. The lifespan is two to three times longer than a traditional road paving
• Little to no maintenance required. The material is virtually impervious to conditions such as the weather and weeds
• The innovation is considerably more sustainable. The goal is to make the PlasticRoad out of 100 percent recycled plastic and to make it fully reusable. It is perfectly in line with the Cradle to Cradle philosophy and the principles of the circular economy
• Double use of space. The hollow space in the design can be used to store water or as space for cables and pipes
• The possibility of constant traffic safety and water drainage
• Everything on and around the road can be prefabricated including road markings and guardrails
• It is scalable. The concept offers opportunities for further innovation. Examples include solar heated roads, light poles, and traffic loop sensors
• A great added advantage is the contribution to the global social problem of plastic waste in an innovative and sustainable way

PlasticRoad is an innovative concept initiative of KWS, a Royal VolkerWessels company and market leader in road construction and the production of asphalt in The Netherlands. KWS partnered with Wavin, a company which operates within Orbia, and is a market leader in the recycling of plastics as well as specialist in making recycled plastic products for drain water drainage, and also with Total, to improve the properties of plastic, the recycling of plastic, and the available production techniques.

It all started when leading road builder KWS' engineers came up with a smart solution to build more sustainable roads: Using plastic. Since then, the group has grown with partnerships that join forces to make cities smarter and sustainable.

Orbia is a purpose-driven company that aims to advance life around the world by focusing its business solutions on addressing six of the world's biggest challenges aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. One of them is to make cities more livable, lovable, resilient, and regenerative.

360,Casting their net further to cut down on carbon footprint,"The 16-year-old climate campaigner Greta Thunburg last month embarked on a 3,300-mile voyage from Plymouth to New York. The teenager’s 15-day journey to attend the UN climate summit in a solar-panelled boat marked almost a year since her first “school strike for climate”. Millions of schoolchildren around the world have been inspired by her example and staged similar protests against the impact of humans on the environment.

Climate activism among UK pupils is on the rise. Schools are meeting this level of interest by launching committees dedicated to reducing their own carbon footprint and getting children involved with the decision-making process.

Jonathan Anderson, the headmaster of Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh, says its sustainability committee has been operating for more than 10 years.",United Kingdom,2019.09
364,Fighting climate change joint effort says Zero Waste Scotland boss,"WE all have the power to help tackle the climate crisis, claimed Zero Waste Scotland chief executive Iain Gulland when he met the youth strikers who edited this issue of the Sunday National.

Gulland discussed his plans with the young activists after Zero Waste Scotland launched its new corporate plan to tackle the climate crisis on Thursday, and elaborated on steps Zero Waste Scotland believe are necessary to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045, the current Scottish target.

Among his aims he underlined the actions individual consumers can take to influence companies to reduce their carbon footprints. They could, for instance, spend more on those companies actively promoting sustainability.

Gulland said: “The urgency of the call from the consumer point of view is realising that we have the power. We have the power to stop buying certain products. We need to start making that choice, and the markets will respond to that, the bigger guys will understand that.

“Whether you’re in charge of NHS procurement or the shop down the road … that’s the responsibility we have, not just saying it’s somebody else’s job.

“Obviously the Government has a role in parts of society but we individually need to start saying ‘I have to change’”.

The youth strikers were sceptical about the effectiveness of individual change.

“Do we all have responsibility? For merely trying to live within our means in a system which was built by generations before us? Do we really have to put it down to every single person being responsible for the climate crisis, when they’re just trying to live?” asked Emil Carr, a 17-year-old youth striker from Glasgow. “Because it’s not them who set up these systems which force us into consumerism and unsustainability.”

Gulland responded: “I guess I’m not suggesting a blame culture. I accept that responsibility, and I understand that, but I think that there are people who have more responsibility to take bigger decisions,

“There are roles we can take from the First Minister right down, there are people who can make big decisions on the behalf of other people and have a bigger impact, so I guess that’s it, but we all have the responsibility to think about that.

“We can have that blame culture in 25 years time when we’ve achieved it, but I think we all just have to get on with it.

“Are we going to go for the ‘hockey stick approach’ as we call it, where everybody does nothing, then the targets creep up

“What I say we need is called a “bell curve”, so we have a tipping point or all of this to happen [which] can’t be 2044, the tipping point needs to be in the next 5 years so that we can achieve the target.

“The bulk of the next 25 years ahead of us we need to be chasing up the laggards, getting them to conform.”

Gulland agreed that our society is based on throwaway products rather than sustainability.

Gulland said: “You think about tangible assets vs intangible assets, or you start thinking about insurance which is another thing, if you get a car, the insurance system is based on depreciating the car as quickly as possible so that you have to go and get another one.”

We discussed that the problem is our model incentivises people to buy and consume rather than reuse or repair. Zero Waste Scotland is calling for radical change by businesses in how they use, produce and supply goods and materials.

“I do believe businesses are looking to act [to tackle the climate crisis] … what is the right thing for them to do to make the biggest difference? That’s where Zero Waste Scotland comes into it.”

Zero Waste Scotland are a non-profit environmental organisation funded by the European Regional Development Fund. They aim to inform policy, and motivate individuals and businesses to embrace the environmental, economic, and social benefits of a circular economy.",Scotland,2019.09
365,The Greenwashed politics of the 21st century will not fool us,"THE Scottish Government became the first country in the world to declare a state of climate emergency in April this year. However, recent headlines suggest the party in governance continue to pursue the further exploration of oilfields in the North Sea. So I ask: How can you commit to climate justice, while still supporting the root cause of the climate crisis?

I’ve seen an increasingly concerning trend on the rise as environmental awareness in the general public increases: Greenwashing.

Originally coined by Jay Westerveld in 1986, it is a term which describes the exploitation of our increasing environmental awareness in order to further corporate consumerism. And unfortunately it works.

Greenwashing has taken on a new form in the recent political discussion around the climate crisis. Governments such as our own are applauding themselves for making meaningless statements and setting baseless targets. The Scottish government has said it is committed to be carbon neutral by 2045, and the UK by 2050 (both of which being lethally late, but that’s for another article), but as of yet have no coherent action plan in achieving this.

Why are they doing this? This new form of greenwashing at a governmental level is equivalent to sweeping the dirt under the rug, claiming they are doing “so much” for the environment while continuing to pursue the enablement of private profit.

But it isn’t working. Extinction Rebellion and the school strikers recognise the need for action, not just lip service, and bring with them a whole set of demands beyond just the climate emergency.

One example of policy which epitomises the political greenwashing of the 21st century is the relentless pursuit of what they call “sustainable growth” – a concept which is entirely oxymoronic.

It should be common sense that you simply cannot keep pursuing he extraction of environmentally damaging resources such as oil while expecting to grow forever.

In order to grow, you need to extract, and by continuing to extract you place the lives of billions of people in danger by furthering the climate crisis.

So, clearly I’m not satisfied, and neither are the majority of activists I know. We won’t be satisfied until our country is responsible for absolutely zero carbon emissions from all sectors.

We won’t be satisfied as long as the government continues to prioritise profit over human wellbeing in its decision making. They have the tools to achieve this: implement a nationwide Green New Deal, and get it over with already.

Too often do we see adverts on social media for an all new “environmentally friendly” range of clothing, or cutlery set, or laundry detergent, that supposedly we must buy in order to do our bit and save the planet.

But the solution to the climate crisis isn’t this new form of green-consumerism. The solution is an end to consumerism altogether. We must entirely restructure our society to create a circular economy.

One which values not the convenience of single-use plastics and consumables, but values sustainability. This not only brings with it the environmental benefits, by reducing our burden on the planet, but brings us all individual benefits in reduced long-term living costs.

The concept extends even to the oil companies and the multinats which are most responsible for the climate crisis. Browse to BP’s Facebook page and you are greeted by an animation of a dog, with its lucious locks blowing in the wind and turbines gently turning in the background.

Or to Shell’s, where their timeline is full of self-praise for their solar-powered EV charging stations. Meanwhile, both companies continue to pursue oil exploration in Alaska and the North Sea, continuing to threaten our futures as they push for greater carbon consumption.

So clearly the ruling class recognise that the climate crisis is a threat. But they do nothing, as they care only for profit and they will do anything they can in its pursuit, irregardless of its social and environmental implications.",Scotland,2019.09
369,The bare necessities Simple ideas that matter,"Using a circular economy methodology, which promotes the use of products that do not end up in landfill and can be reused in a variety of ways without harming the environment, is the only sustainable option. Small changes in your daily life is all it would take to bring about that big change

What is waste? It is a poignant question that is often answered the same way in waste education workshops conducted by the Bangalore-based social business, Bare Necessities (that promotes adoption of zero waste practices, circular economy methodology and sustainability to consumers and businesses throughout India and further abroad through designing zero waste products, running educational workshops and providing sustainability consulting) as ‘waste is plastic’, ‘chip packets’, ‘chocolate wrappers’, ‘food scraps’, ‘drink bottles’, ‘juice boxes’...

These are all correct answers and there are many more of those fantastic responses that are received from school children as young as five or six years to well educated adults with tertiary degrees and many other people between. The feedback is exceptionally specific, which has its benefits, yet, for our discussion here, let’s look at it on a broader note — Waste, as we would all agree, is humanity’s excess.

Humanity is overproducing and over consuming (or not consuming at all if we take a look at landfills), research shows that the “average person buys 60% more items of clothing than they did 15 years ago”, and, “an estimated one-third of all food produced — equivalent to 1.3 billion tonnes worth around $1 trillion — ends up rotting in the bins of consumers and retailers, or spoiling due to poor transportation and harvesting practices”. These are two of several examples that could be used to illustrate this point. However, instead of finding more cases, let’s think about why these situations occur? It has been noted that within the textile industry, within India, the one major reason why there is so much waste is because of a lack of awareness and education about how fashion can fit within a circular economy. Textile industry is the third largest producer of waste in most Indian states behind plastic and paper.

Notably too, research has shown that the current food system “exerts a considerable impact on the environment. It drives deforestation and biodiversity loss, contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and accounts for 70% of water withdrawals”. This is a problem that affects every individual on the planet no matter where one is standing, but has the potential to disproportionately affect locations with larger societal inequalities — “almost 2 billion people go hungry or undernourished” across the globe. Thus, part of the reason why this is occurring is because of a lack of awareness. But, that is only a part of the problem.

For, if we were to look at similar types of excess in other areas of life, such as energy use (large cars, technologies such as smartphones) or in the areas of lifestyle and personal care products, we are forced to rethink if it is only about awareness. At an individual level, the focus should be to divert waste from landfill by using innovative design that fits within a circular economy.

A growing number of Sustainability businesses, such as Bare Necessities, aim to raise the level of awareness about the amount of excess that humanity is producing through their talks and workshops while providing alternatives and brainstorming ideas with consumers in order to assess whether there is a need for a product and then designing it for a market that desires innovation that reduces excess. These businesses target a specific and growing market of conscious consumers.

Within the Indian market, the growth in conscious consumers has been led by leaders both individually and in business. Sharing of facts and figures is one important way to raise awareness. For instance, not many are aware that there is “estimated as many as 8.3 billion plastic straws (that) pollute the world’s beaches”. Or, that for dental care items such as toothbrushes and toothpaste tubes, “the package is not noticed during purchase, transport, and use of the product. In fact, it is not noticed until the minute the product is consumed and the package has fulfilled its function and turns into waste”. Similarly for soap, “though one wrapper of soap or one bottle of shampoo might not seem to matter, it can definitely make a difference when multiplied by over a billion people, who live in India and who comprise one-seventh of the world’s population”. Individuals, businesses and groups, by becoming more aware and implementing action plans (through design, reduction in use of products and other areas) are steadily able to do more to limit waste and humanity’s excess.

This brings us to our next question — why is it such a struggle to change? There are a growing amount of facts about these areas of excess that illustrate the detrimental effects of a linear life cycle — the take, make, dispose system that sees many of our products resources being extracted from a limited resource (the planet) before being used and then disposed back into the environment.

Research demonstrates that using a circular economy methodology, which promotes the use of products that do not end up in landfill — instead the products can be reused in a variety of ways without harming the environment — is the only sustainable option. The circular economy is hugely beneficial in ensuring that humanity no longer produces and consumes products with a take-make-dispose methodology, and thereby helps to sustain both us and the environment we live in.

When you think about it on a day to day basis, there are numerous systems around you that call for your attention — where you buy your food is one example and how often you wear your clothes is another. All systems have set processes that are, more or less, controlled by majority stakeholders, who have the greatest say of how a system functions, in terms of production and consumption. This is not, however, doom and gloom, the thing to remember with systems is that until there is enough consumer demand, change often will not occur. Currently, slowly but surely, large companies are becoming aware of the growing consumer demand.

There is a growing focus on designing new solutions that must be valued by all for long term reduction in the contamination of water, land and air — our environment. Examples of this can be seen as far afield as Mexico where a company is transforming avocado pits into disposable bioplastic straws and cutlery, and in Indonesia where the root vegetable cassava is used to create biodegradable bags. By designing new products, along with minimising single use items, correctly disposing of used products in correct categories and limiting the amount of non-organic material, cleaning agents for example, used on a day to day basis, creating a zero waste environment for our all important planet can be achieved.

Consumer demand, and a willingness to accept responsibility as an individual, is at the heart of production and consumption. Fortunately there is a growing number of consumers, especially in the larger urban centres of India, who are currently wanting change and already taking responsibility. Businesses too are making their stand, for instance, Bare Necessities provides sustainable options to toothbrushes, cosmetics, detergents, soap, and even the humble tote bag among other products. These are all simple ideas that matter.

What, then, is waste? The answers heard at the beginning of a talk or workshop are largely those pointing to excess, yet, if we were to look at it in a different light, perhaps it is simply that it is a resource that we have yet to use, because everything matters when taking positive steps toward sustainability on a planet with finite resources. Therefore, we must endeavour to value every item, whether that is a piece of fruit, an item of clothing or any of the specific answers to the waste question touched on at the outset, we need to take the responsibility right down to the most bare necessities.

The conferment is assigned by the friars to political, cultural and civil society personalities who have distinguished themselves for their commitment in favoring peace, dialogue and acceptance.

Dhaka (AsiaNews-Agencies) - The Franciscan friars of Assisi have conferred the prize ""Lamp of peace of St. Francis"" on the Bengali economist and banker Muhammad Yunus.

The award is given each year by the Franciscan fathers of the Sacred Convent to political, cultural and civil society personalities who have distinguished themselves for their commitment to foster peace, dialogue and acceptance. Before him, Pope John Paul II, the Dalai Lama, Mother Teresa of Calcutta and Mikhail Gorbachev have been honoured.

The award was given last week in the basilica dedicated to the saint of Assisi, in the context of ""Percorsi Assisi"", a training school in inter-university economics born out of a collaboration between the friars and the Italian institutes of higher education. The school supports the vision of Pope Francis and re-launches its appeals to foster a new just, fraternal and sustainable economy.

Yunus, 79, is the creator and creator of modern micro-credit: it consists of a system of small loans intended for poor entrepreneurs who are unable to obtain financing from traditional banking circuits. For his efforts in this field, in 2006 he also won the Nobel Peace Prize.

The Lamp was awarded for the first time in 1981 to the Polish Lech Walesa, founder of Solidarnosc, the first independent trade union organization of the Soviet bloc. It represents the simplicity of the Franciscan message: the glass container recalls purity, while the burning oil is a symbol of humility and desire for rebirth both in faith and in social commitment. It is a replica of the oil lamp positioned next to the tomb of St. Francis.

Receiving the award, Yunus confided concern about ""three challenges that endanger the human being on this planet: the extreme concentration of wealth on an ongoing basis, the rapid environmental degradation and the growth of artificial intelligence"". At the end of the ceremony, the professor gave a lectio magistralis on the subject of circular economy and micro-credit.",Italy,2019.09

377,Young Scottish school climate strikers guest edit Sunday National,"TOMORROW’S Sunday National will be guest-edited by a group of Scotland’s young climate strikers.

It comes ahead of the Global Strike For Climate, which takes place on September 20 and includes events in Glasgow and Edinburgh.

Among the line-up of guest editors is Erin Curtis, the 15-year-old from Glasgow whose question to the five Tory candidates in their leadership race debate on the BBC shot her to fame.

On shaping this weekend’s Sunday National, she said: “We want people to be aware of what’s happening so they can get involved. It’s a good opportunity for us to present our cause to people and persuade them to have their voices heard.

“We want to be listened to – it’s got a lot of info, the edition on Sunday, about why we strike and what we believe in, and we think if people want to educate themselves on w hat our movement is about, they should pick up a copy.”

Dylan Hamilton, 15, said editing the Sunday National would be a chance to put the focus on what is happening to the climate, rather than the fact they were missing school – saying the latter was missing the point.

The activist went on: “The media like opposition. So they tend not to cover the strikes themselves very often.

“The BBC have sent reporters and not covered it at all.

“Suddenly, when Edinburgh Council challenge us, they have an article on it the next day. And they’ve tried to put climate change deniers on to debate with us three times – that is not okay.”

Neelu Saraswatibhatla, 17, was inspired to get involved on this issue after seeing a lack of action from adults in response to the IPCC report.

He said: ""The media could do a better job of advertising our events. They don’t cover our strikes nearly as much as they should.""

Emil Carr, 17, said being guest editors would be an excellent opportunity to bring their points on reliance on oil to National readers, explaining: ""I think there tends to be a tendency among independence supporters to be very invested in oil, seeing Scotland’s economy revolving around it if we become independent.

""We see this as a good chance to say that, no, Scotland could be independent – we’re not expressing an opinion on that – and still prosper centred around a renewable circular economy.""",Scotland,2019.09

385,Meet the Sustainability Leader: Circular Economy Innovation - Yellow Octopus Fashion,"With entries now open for edie's Sustainability Leaders Awards 2020, this new feature series showcases the achievements of the 2019 winners and reveals their secrets to success. Up next: The winner of our Circular Economy Innovation Award, Yellow Octopus Fashion.

In a bid to drive consumer behaviour change and spur a tangible reduction in the amount of garment waste sent to landfill in the UK, Yellow Octopus Fashion has developed a truly innovative digital app.

The global fast fashion problem is huge and growing, with more than 100 billion garments and 20 billion pairs of shoes produced worldwide every year. The majority of these items will be worn just a handful of times before being disposed of, with the ReWear Project estimating that 85% - equivalent to 16 million tonnes - ends up in landfill or incinerators annually.

The UK has no small part to play in driving this problem, with the average consumer buying 26.7kg of new clothing every year - more than any other European nation – and spending more than £1,000 per year on fashion. Indeed, Brits are estimated to send 300,000 tonnes of textiles to landfill annually.

While leading fashion brands move to use more sustainably sourced materials and launch repair, resale and rental services championing the circular economy, sustainable solutions firm Yellow Octopus’ fashion arm has developed a solution to the consumer piece of the puzzle. Called ReGAIN and developed by the company’s in-house IT experts, the digital app uses GPS mapping and tracking to let users know where their nearest clothing take-back or drop-off points are.

There are an estimated 20,000 of these facilities nationwide, with the majority hosted by charities, local authorities or retailers such as H&M and Marks & Spencer (M&S). Once garments are collected in these facilities, they are typically sorted, with items in wearable condition sent to charitable causes within the UK or abroad. Clothing which is not in a wearable condition is usually used to make rags or shredded for recycling into insulation or fillers.

In order to incentivise the use of the app, users are rewarded with a coupon of their choice for making a clothing donation. Coupons entitle the holder to a discount at retailers including Superdry, New Balance and Asics. Alternatively, users can opt for vouchers that can be redeemed for holidays with Expedia or Hotels.com, or lifestyle products and services from brands such as EVE Sleep, Gusto and BodyBuilding.com. Our judges praised this reward method, noting that it is “highly likely” to incentivise both awareness and action – even among the most disengaged consumers of fashion.

While some retailers have developed incentivised take-back schemes in their stores in recent years, Yellow Octopus Fashion claims that ReGAIN is the first multi-brand take-back scheme with a cash incentive – and the first with a digital app in the UK.

The app launched in the UK in spring 2018 and has already received praise from Dame Ellen MacArthur, founder and chair of circular economy organisation The Ellen MacArthur Foundation. ReGAIN is recognised under the Foundation’s Make Fashion Circular Initiative, which works with innovators and fashion retailers in order to create a “new normal” for waste and resource management in the fashion sector. It is also a participant in the Fashion For Good programme, the Textile Recycling Association’s circular economy initiative and a signatory to WRAP’s SCAP 2020 commitment, which helps industry stakeholders work together to transition away from cradle-to-grave business models.

The app notably spurred the diversion of 45,000kg of garments from landfill and incineration within its first five months of operation, with retail supporters including ASOS, Primark, Boohoo and Missguided. Logistics firm DPD is also a partner of the app and uses its courier service to transport donated clothing from take-back facilities to UK recycling plants.

Our judges were impressed both with the strong focus the app places on fostering long-lasting behaviour change from users, and its potential to vastly improve the resource efficiency of a large sector.

The fashion industry is believed to employ almost one in every seven working-age people worldwide and accounts for around 10% of global emissions. Experts have continually warned that without ambitious action on resource efficiency, the sector could account for a quarter of global carbon emissions by 2050. This is, therefore, no small sector to abate, and while brands have made progress to address the industry’s waste problems, judges praised ReGAIN for offering a “joined-up” solution which unites consumers and retailers for a common goal.

Looking to the future, Yellow Octopus Fashion told edie that it would like to advertise the app on online fashion retail websites as big-name brands begin to tentatively explore new business models which encourage garment reuse, resale and repair.

What the judges said: “The Yellow Octopus Fashion app recognises the importance of social engagement, incentivises behaviour change and targets a large industry in which waste is high,giving it a huge impact potential.

""It also targets new groups, including those who are disengaged with sustainability, making Yellow Octopus the standout winner of this category.""

386,South Australia embraces the circular economy,"Although the United Nations reports that less than 10 per cent of all the world’s plastic is recycled, South Australia diverts more than 80 per cent of its waste from landfill to be composted or reused in the circular economy according to a sustainability report by the South Australian government.

The circular economy, driven by renewable flows of energy, is an adjacent model to the linear economy (create, use, discard) and aims to regenerate a product or material at its end of life.

South Australia’s engagement with the circular economy is demonstrated by the its commitment to sustainability – the state harvests eight gigalitres of storm water annually for reuse and sources more than 50 per cent of its energy from renewable sources – as well as subsidies for these industries and policies.

When South Australian Minister for Environment and Water David Speirs announced the impending ban of single use plastics in July, he said the prohibition of these materials cemented the state as a leader in the war on waste.

Speirs said South Australia is committed to working with the community and stakeholders to address the impacts of single-use plastic “to ensure that we continue to maintain this state’s reputation as a leader in waste management”.

Local companies are leading the way for green innovation, with a range of enterprises breathing new life into materials and engaging with the circular economy.

Here are four innovative companies in South Australia that reuse resources and eliminate unwanted materials.

The Northern Adelaide Waste Management Authority (NAWMA) is a garbage, recycling and green waste collection service that has operated in the state’s capital of Adelaide since 1999.

The company diverts 2,1000 tonnes of material intended for waste through bin collections or commercial pick-ups annually in the Northern region, and 30,000 tonnes from the broader South Australian community.

Eighty-three per cent of all waste it collects is diverted from landfill and what it can’t divert is harvested for methane gas to supplement the solar power that runs the factory.

NAWMA works with local councils to collect waste and sells their harvested recycled materials to other businesses to close the circular economy loop.

NAWMA Education and Projects Coordinator Penelope Morrison said South Australia was the first Australian jurisdiction to have a Circular Economy Strategy and leads the way in waste management.

“With globally competitive recycling rates, a mature resource recovery sector, and engaged stakeholders at all levels, South Australia is looked upon by an international audience on how to responsibly manage resources,” said Morrison.

“NAWMA has made a series of bold commitments, including processing 100 per cent of the yellow bin on Australian Shores by 2020, and working with our councils to purchase 50 per cent of recyclables back in the form of sustainable procurement by 2023.

“These two commitments will singlehandedly transition the resource recovery sector to a circular solution.”

Advanced Plastic Recycling (APR) has transformed discarded materials into furniture and timber alternatives for 16 years.

The company converts melted HDPE (high-density polyethylene) pellets into a wood plastic composite material for private infrastructure pieces such as bollards, benches, boardwalks and more.

The material is a wood plastic blend that makes the products stronger, more weatherable and environmentally friendly because it does not leach chemicals into the ground like treated wood and it reuses unwanted plastic.

CEO Ryan Lokan said South Australia is the most advanced state in Australia in regards to the circular economy, and has largest amount of supportive infrastructure.

“We are an antidote to the recycling crisis in the sense that we then take that pellet and create a product that is both environmentally friendly, sustainable, economic and environmental. It’s an alternative to cutting down trees to pulling up natural resources,” said Lokan.

“Right now those arrows sort of represent the movement of the plastic, whereas what we’re trying to do is turn the arrows around and say it should be based on demand.

“The greater the demand for my products by councils, then the greater the demand I have for clean plastic, and the greater demand he has for mix plastics, and the greater demand they have for positive collections.”

Container Deposit Systems (CDS) has been at the forefront of recycling since 1977 with the introduction of its bottles and containers refund scheme.

CDS employs Semi Auto Return Terminals (ART) which allow customers to return deposit cans, plastic bottles and glass in any condition for a 10c-per-container refund.

The ARTs identify and sort containers through an integration of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technology and a vision counting and sorting system developed by Adelaide-based technology and engineering company SAGE Automation.

CDS aims reduce litter and be an active participant in resource recovery.

Although the Environmental Protection Agency South Australia reports beverage containers make up only 2.8 per cent of litter, the state has a return rate of almost 77 per cent and leads the nation.

SAGE Automation designed the new smart container deposit systems and General Manager Paul Johnson said the terminals are above 99 per cent accurate in counting deposit containers.

“The vision system that identifies the containers is bespoke, and we hope for it to become a national solution.”

Hans Van Schaik has experimented with composted materials, to find their value as a resource, for almost half a decade.

Van Shaik engages with the circular economy by developing and manufacturing mulch, soil and substrates from natural materials that would be discarded for his company Bio Gro.

By diverting green waste from landfill the company can convert materials – some of which is animal waste collected from abattoirs – into high quality products for private and commercial horticultural and agricultural industries, like soil conditioners, mulch and liquid stimulants.

The company also provides wood residue to hydroponic grower Holla-Fresh. Holla-Fresh then provides the plant bi-product biochar – valuable soil in the form of charcoal – to Bio Gro to manufacture products.

Production innovation and marketing manager Darren Free said Bio Gro’s circular recovery business model processes and diverts around 300,000 tonnes of waste a year from landfill.

“Recovered forestry material, construction timbers, agricultural bi-products, green and food organics is composted and processed into a variety of high-quality products,” Free said.

“The pine bark recovered from the timber industry is processed and composted turning it into premium potting mix. This is then used by the nursery industry to grow plants, it’s even used to grow new pine trees. The potting mix is also bagged and sold into the retail market for home gardeners.

“This is an important demonstration of a local company’s endeavours in creating a business model based on landfill diversion and an organic circular economy to reduce harmful gases being released into the atmosphere.”",Germany,2019.09
390,Unusual Rigging leads the Circular Economy debate at PLASA 2019 - ETNow.com,"UK - Unusual Rigging's Tom Harper will lead a session hosted by SiPA at PLASA 2019 which aims to explore how 'Circular' the live production industry really is.

The session which takes place on 15th September at 14.00 will look at how the industry needs to decouple 'show business' from the highly wasteful, energy intensive and inefficient consumption of finite resources.

Tom, a director at Unusual Rigging as well as the company's Circular Economy lead, recently completed his MBA in Circular Economy Innovation and is passionate to drive forward system shifts to ensure an effective transition towards an economic model that is regenerative by design.

""This isn't just about what we at Unusual Rigging can do, although we are very much trying to lead by example. It's about working with the entire industry in order to radically reduce consumption levels. We are locked in a system in which everything favours the linear model of production and consumption where we 'take, make and waste'. But there are things that the live production industry can be doing to drive forward the transition to a Circular Economy, we'll use this session to identify those things and figure out how we can accelerate this transition.""

Unusual's Emily Egleton will join the panel alongside Carol Scott from Tait, John Winters from the National Theatre and Dr Greg Lavery from Rype Office. Emily will be touching on the innovations preserving the 'Technosphere'.

Emily commented: ""It's looking at designing for disassembly, designing for durability and establishing robust reverse networks in the value chain that can be fully recovered, refurbished and reused, thereby closing the loop. This has been at the forefront of our work at the Theatre Royal on Drury Lane which is currently undergoing massive refurbishment works.""

Tom added: ""Since pushing forward with this model of business at Unusual, we now have a team member on site whose job it is to sift through the material we reclaim from site and to identify all the items that can be reused.""

He concluded: ""We are really looking forward to a lively and informative discussion and debate with the delegates who attend our session at PLASA. We're confident it will encourage questions and start the ball rolling for many other companies within the industry to get on board, while promising to be both lively and inspiring.""",United Kingdom,2019.09
393,Webinar 144: Circular Economy in Japan,"What are the characteristics of the Japanese Circular Economy in terms of policy, business and trade? 



The Japanese government has taken significant steps to develop a circular economy policy framework. It incorporates the Japanese concepts of a Sound Material-Cycle Society (SMCS) and the 3Rs (reduce reuse and recycle) to promote waste minimisation and effective utilisation of resources, driven by a concern about the lack of landfill sites and the need for effective resource use. The Japanese government also has a long history of developing waste management legislation to ensure proper waste management and address illegal acts. In light of this, a very finely tuned policy framework for establishing a SMCS and a fundamental plan have been formulated. In parallel, Japanese businesses have developed actions and technologies to respond the SMCS policies. It is vital to understand Japanese unique circular economy system in order to collaborate with Japanese partners in this sector.

The webinar is targeted to EU companies seeking to collaborate with Japanese business in the area of circular economy.

In 40 minutes from your desk, you will discover:
• The approach to have certifications for products which uses recycled materials
• What type of circular economy business exists in Japan and the market size
• What recyclable materials are exported from Japan to what countries

394,Involving citizen in circular economy,"A recently started project CECI involves six regions in Europe to improve their policy instruments in context of citizen involvement and circular economy. Through sharing good practices between partners, participating in training and workshops and creating action plans to improve policy instruments, the regions can provide better possibilities for their citizen to adopt new circular and sharing economy solutions. A systematic change in consumption patterns to a sustainable path create demand for new services, which is a seed for green growth.

The role of citizens in circular and sharing economy

Circular and sharing economy solutions are an essential part of sustainable consumption. They increase the resource-efficiency and reduce the generation of waste. The CECI project is interested especially in those solutions and innovations, which may have business potential.

The master image of CECI shows a few general examples of what citizens, we all, could do differently in future than what have done before. We could use shared vehicles or buy mobility services instead of owning vehicles, borrow tools and other products, or share our property, such as an apartment. We could take old or broken products to become repaired, renew or totally remanufactured instead of throwing them away as waste. We could also sort out all our waste and provide resources for producers to substitute natural resources. All these activities can create new services.

The project CECI has a three-year implementation phase and a one-year follow-up phase. At the regional level, the main activities are to identify good practices in citizen involvement and to develop action plans to improve policy instruments. The fruits of the process are shared along the way with other regions in the interregional meetings, where also stakeholders from all regions are invited. These meetings will also include training and workshops to increase knowledge about methods for citizen engagement. In the follow-up phase, partner regions monitor the implementation of their action plans.

During the first semester, the regional stakeholder groups meet and discover the current situation of policy instruments and the state of art of circular economy. The results will be shared in the first interregional meeting in Lahti, Finland in 3-4 December 2019. The meeting gathers together the project consortium and stakeholders from Finland, France, Czech Republic, Spain, Bulgaria and Belgium. Examples of citizen involvement from the Päijät-Häme region will be presented to the participants.

397,Aeroengines investigated in circular economy study,"A research project led by Exeter University is seeking to demonstrate how data collected from products in use such as aeroengines can help companies adopt strategies for re-using resources.

The EPSRC-funded ‘Circular 4.0’ project aims to demonstrate that adopting circular economy principles can add value to businesses – economically, environmentally, and through increased brand value. Partners include Rolls-Royce, Airbus and Cranfield University.

By the end of the project in January 2022 the project expects to have identified three specific use cases applying to Rolls-Royce, Airbus and hydrogen fuel cell car manufacturer Riversimple. The researchers also hope to work with other partners through a series of industry engagement days.

The project proposal notes that although there have been successes “by a handful of manufacturers to move towards more sustainable practices through the use of data-driven intelligence”, businesses remain unclear about how to implement circular economy strategies.

Project leader Prof Fiona Charnley, deputy director of the Centre for Circular Economy in Exeter University’s business school, said that among the project partners, Rolls-Royce’s use case was currently the most advanced.

Rolls-Royce collects a wide range of data from its aeroengines, including condition monitoring information but also flying hours and historical information about which components fail most frequently. This aim is to combine this with other big data sources on weather patterns, and whether the engine has been flown in sandy or salty conditions, for example, to develop a “health metric” to assess the remaining life of different components. In turn this will make possible more informed decisions about whether parts can be “harvested” for re-use in reconditioned engines, for example.

“An engine contains lots of different components and they have different life cycles. There’s quite a lot of wasted value – at the end of a life cycle an engine is taken apart and it’s not really understood how much life or value is left in some of those components,” Prof Charnley said.

This approach could lead to a reduction in the use of valuable finite resources. “As resources get more expensive, high value manufacturers are trying to reduce their use of virgin resources,” she added. There is potentially significant business value for companies in reducing their reliance on new resources, but though they may have components that have a lot of life left in them they lack “the specific data to demonstrate that they are as good as new effectively”.",United Kingdom,2019.09
398,How the circular economy can help save our planet,"It is clear from the protests across Scotland and around the world that public demand for greater action on the climate emergency is growing.

But while more and more people and businesses know they need to change and genuinely want to do the right thing, too few know what that should be.

And too many still wrongly fear that saving the planet will come at a hefty cost to their lifestyles or the profit margins of the companies they run or work for.

Ask anyone what they think they should do to play their part in fighting the climate crisis and chances are they will say something like ‘fly less’ or perhaps ‘buy local’.

But while both of those things could undoubtedly help, the single most effective way for consumers and industry alike to dramatically cut the carbon emissions driving up global warming is this:

We need to kick our huge consumption habit.

Around four fifths of Scotland’s carbon footprint is caused by the heat and electricity needed to grow, make, process, transport and provide the vast amount of goods and materials which we produce and consume as a nation.

Our collective appetite for cheap, throwaway everyday purchases has grown beyond all recognition in recent times. We are now at a point where while once we just talked of fast food, we are now all too familiar with the rise of fast fashion as well.

The main driver for the high environmental costs of the way we shop is the rising numbers of products we purchase which are manufactured abroad and imported, generating a greater carbon footprint through the way they are made and the distances they must be transported to reach our homes and businesses.

That sounds like a big problem, and it is. But it is also a major opportunity for Scottish businesses to significantly reduce the nation’s carbon emissions - and meet public demand to combat the climate emergency - by switching to more sustainable ways of producing and supplying products.

Some are already reaping the benefits, economically and environmentally, of doing just that.

But many firms and organisations wrongly assume that reducing the cost to the planet means increasing costs for them.

As we have and will continue to make clear, there are significant savings and profits to be made by joining the circular economy where goods and materials are kept in use for as long as possible through reuse, re-manufacture and repair before eventually being recycled.

READ MORE: How green is your council area? We reveal the reality of Scotland's carbon footprint … and the results might surprise you

Making the best use of our limited resources is not bad for business, it is good for business.

Some may also question the need to change our lifestyles or business models given the real success which Scotland has had in de-carbonising our energy thanks to the Scottish Government’s pioneering renewables policies.

The world-leading drive pushing a nationwide switch from fossil fuels to green alternatives such as wind and tidal turbines has significantly reduced the carbon impact of our energy use.

But while the results are extremely valuable and welcome, they will not be enough on their own to address the climate emergency when the majority of the nation’s carbon emissions are caused by our vast demand for raw materials to make everyday products.

This constant craving is not only driving up carbon emissions.

Extracting ever more of our precious but limited resources from the ground is also causing a host of related environmental issues including deforestation, habitat and species loss, water shortages and plastic pollution.

So, by committing to reducing our reliance on raw materials and remaking items so that they can be used again and again, businesses will not only significantly reduce global carbon emissions, they will also help to prevent wider environmental damage.

Tackling our consumption habit doesn’t mean that everyone should stop buying things.

It means we must radically change the way we think about and consume our goods and materials to maximise their value for us and the planet.

READ MORE: 'No-one is too small to make a difference on climate crisis'

And to do that we need to accelerate our progress towards a circular economy.

Today I am launching Zero Waste Scotland’s corporate plan setting out how we will lead this work, building on our past successes by making Scotland a truly circular nation.

One of the most useful tools we have is our ground-breaking Carbon Metric system for assessing the causes and consequences of our emissions, which has consistently shown that the vast majority are generated through the production, consumption and waste of materials and products.

As we move forward, we need to expand our existing collaborations with businesses nationwide to find and share innovative, new ways to make the most of what we have.

The pressure is on all businesses in every sector to take a long, hard look at how they produce, consume and dispose of everyday items too.

And those which don’t act now to adapt and meet growing public pressure risk being left behind, as their competitors pioneer sustainable business models.

Scotland was once at the forefront of the industrial revolution.

Since the turn of the 21st century we have been leading the world’s renewables revolution. Now we must pioneer a circular economy revolution to safeguard the future of people, wildlife and the planet for generations to come.",United Kingdom,2019.09
399,"Scottish businesses must harness circular economy opportunities to tackle global emissions or be left behind, says Zero Waste Scotland","Businesses that don’t act now to meet growing public pressure to tackle the global climate emergency risk being left behind, as competitors pioneer business models that reduce carbon emissions and maximise use of limited materials, Zero Waste Scotland has warned.

The environmental expert said organisations must do more and examine how they produce, consume, and dispose of everyday items, in order to keep up.

Zero Waste Scotland stressed that firms achieving a more sustainable way of working would deliver huge results in cutting Scotland’s carbon footprint.

This is because four fifths of Scotland’s carbon footprint in generated through the heat and energy required to grow, make, process, transport, and provide materials that are often tossed aside at the end of their life.

By achieving greater value from their materials and working more efficiently, businesses have the opportunity to pioneer new methods that will work in the long-term as the implications of the climate emergency become clearer and start to have an impact.

Furthermore, the organisation warns that focusing efforts on making energy systems low carbon will not tackle global emissions alone.

Decarbonisation fails to address the demand for raw materials, which are often made elsewhere using carbon-intensive energy.

Only by considering how to make products with less reliance on raw materials, and by remaking items at the end of their original life into goods that can be used multiple times, will businesses be able to significantly reduce global emissions.

Iain Gulland, Chief Executive for Zero Waste Scotland, said: “We must radically change the way we think above and consume our goods and materials, and we must do that now. We need to accelerate our progress towards a circular economy.”

“Our ground-breaking Carbon Metric system for assessing the causes and consequences of our emissions has consistently shown that the vast majority are generated through the production, consumption, and waste of materials and products.”

“Around four fifths of our carbon footprint is caused by our huge consumption habit, and is fed primarily by goods which are manufactured abroad and imported. To tackle climate change we can’t ignore the emissions that are created overseas to feed our economy.”

“Too many businesses assume that reducing the cost to the planet means increasing costs for them. But as we have and will continue to make clear, the opportunities are plentiful, with massive saving to be made.”

“The current way of working cannot continue in the years ahead and successfully adopting a circular economy approach is the only long-term option.”",United Kingdom,2019.09
402,"£35 billion investment needed for ""radical"" waste sector transition","Making the most of waste and secondary resources over the next 20-30 years will require investment of up to thirty-five billion pounds, according to a report published today by SUEZ, which explores the current and future economic outlook for the resources and waste sector.

The report, entitled “The Economics of Change in the Resources and Waste Sector”, provides an analysis of the current economic drivers in the sector and goes on to explore how future environmental policy target metrics related to CO2, natural capital and biodiversity will necessitate substantial additional investment.

Among the new cost drivers in the next twenty years will be the need to invest in new technologies and facilities capable of converting residual waste not just into electrical energy, but fuel and chemical molecules too; to overhaul logistics and container infrastructure; collect new or niche material streams, such as flexible packaging; develop new data collection and analytics systems; and invest in education and behavioural change communications campaigns.

The report provides a breakdown of the cost and value drivers in the current resources and waste management landscape – such as the proportion of costs for various waste management activities within council budgets and comparators in costs between England and the devolved administrations.

The report will be formally launched by SUEZ at the RWM with CIWM Exhibition in Birmingham on Thursday 12 September at 13.15 in the Circular Economy Connect Theatre.

CEO of SUEZ recycling and recovery UK, David Palmer-Jones said: “The resources and waste sector has seen massive change over the past decade, and actors in our sector have invested more than ten billion in the transition away from landfill, moving waste materials further up the waste hierarchy.

“However, SUEZ believes, as is set out in this short report, that the coming transition over the next twenty years will be even more radical, and will require accelerated investment more than three times greater than that made over the past decade or so.

“The money flows and economics of future resource management systems will be fundamentally different to today, in support of new objectives and through new participants in the sector, drawn in by new legislation and regulation.

“The weight-based metrics we have used to date have taken us so far, and resulted in more sustainable practices as material has shifted away from landfill, but new more sophisticated metrics, seeking to directly address the major environmental challenges of our time – climate change and the loss of biodiversity and natural capital – will change the game significantly. Full net Cost Recovery producer responsibility and new methods of harvesting materials, like deposit return schemes, will change revenue and material flows and will require new consumer behaviours – which we know from the last decade of recycling, are not easily or quickly changed.

We welcome the challenge though and, with the support of Government, through transparent, consistent, and ambitious policy, there is no reason why the sector cannot deliver the investment, skills and technologies required for a more sustainable future.”",United Kingdom,2019.09
405,#InTheLoop: Hubbub and Starbucks invest in circular economy for coffee cups,"#InTheLoop: Hubbub and Starbucks invest in circular economy for coffee cups

As part of its partnership with Starbucks, environmental charity Hubbub has this week awarded funding to a string of projects aimed at creating a circular economy for coffee cups.

Called The Cup Fund, the scheme has seen 12 startups across the UK receive a grant of between £50,000 and £100,000 each to scale up their innovative products, systems and concepts.

The funding for the grants was raised through Starbucks’ 5p levy on paper cups, which it introduced to all 970 of its UK stores last summer.

Hubbub said it launched the Cup Fund because, although the UK now has enough specialist recycling facilities to process all of the disposable paper cups used nationwide every year, behaviour change and financing challenges are still preventing organisations throughout the on-the-go drinks sector’s value chain from collecting the cups and transporting them to these facilities.

Among the projects to have won funding are DS Smith’s cup takeback scheme for businesses. The scheme provides a box to offices, in which workers are encouraged to deposit their used coffee cups. Once full to their 700-cup capacity, the boxes are collected by Royal Mail and sent to be recycled into new paper products at DS Smith’s recycled paper mill.

DS Smith said it launched the scheme after its own research found that more than half (58%) of British workers who buy a takeaway coffee at least once a fortnight dispose of the cup at their workplace.

Other winners include the University of Northampton’s ambition to recycle 160,000 coffee cups from around the town’s most popular destinations and biggest workplaces. In order to ascertain where to place this recycling infrastructure, the University is working with a consortium of businesses, as well as the local council.

“The fund was developed in close collaboration with the recycling industry ensuring that all the collected cups will be recycled within the UK into a variety of new products including high-quality stationary and cardboard boxes,” Hubbub co-founder Trewin Restorick said.

“The investment in coffee cup recycling facilities will make it possible to recycle an extra 35 million cups per annum. The winning projects cover the heart of London, major cities, shopping centres, universities and motorway service stations.”

The allocation of The Cup Fund funding comes in the same week that Hubbub has launched #InTheLoop – a programme aimed at boosting recycling infrastructure and changing behaviours in on-the-go scenarios.

The scheme will see new recycling bins for materials such as plastic bottles, glass bottles, drinks cans and coffee cups installed across Swansea City Centre.

This infrastructure, co-funded by Swansea City Council, Hubbub and its business partners, will be complemented with a new communications campaign reminding residents and visitors to recycle when they’re out and about.

Interactive installations and events will also be put on, for the same purpose, and promoted across social media using the #InTheLoop hashtag.

#InTheLoop is modelled after Hubbub’s flagship on-the-go recycling scheme Leeds By Example. Launched last summer, the initiative has seen 124 new recycling points installed across Leeds City Centre, including machines which offer reward vouchers for each piece of packaging deposited, and bins that blow bubbles when used.

Before the scheme launched in June 2018, Hubbub investigated the proportion of Leeds residents and visitors who were regularly disposing of their plastic packaging, drinks cans and coffee cups in recycling bins while they were out and about, reaching a figure of 17%.

It now estimates that the proportion stands at 32%, after 600,000 coffee cups, 55,000 plastic bottles and 65,000 cans were collected through the scheme during its first six months of operation – results which have paved the way for a wider rollout in other cities.",Ireland,2019.09

417,UK researchers promote circular economy during visit to Malaysia | Brunel University London,"A researcher from Brunel University London has been working to strengthen collaborations with Malaysia and promote a circular economy approach to municipal solid waste management.

Dr Eleni Iacovidou, a researcher in Environmental Management at Brunel University London along with NERC Industrial Innovation (Rutherford) Research Fellow Dr Kok Siew Ng (Department of Engineering Science), recently spent two weeks in Malaysia meeting with key stakeholders from government, academia, industry and NGOs to gain a better understanding of the country’s waste management system and propose recommendations for addressing the multiple issues faced by the waste management sector.

During their trip the researchers met the Head of Department of Chemical Engineering at Universiti Putra Malaysia and visited the Sustainable Process Engineering Research Centre (SPERC), a newly established research centre at UPM pioneering the application of a systems approach in designing and integrating new industrial and waste valorisation technologies and processes.

The researchers also had the opportunity to meet the VC of Penang Green Council, YB Phee Boon Poh (main picture), who has introduced various initiatives including the banning of polystyrene packaging and introducing a partial ban on single-use plastic bags, and has further plans to promote alternative options for municipal solid waste management.

At Malaysia’s National Solid Waste Management Department (JPSPN), the Deputy Director General (Technical) of JPSPN provided the team with invaluable insights into the various issues and challenges relevant to municipal solid waste management in Malaysia, such as the importing of contaminated plastic waste.

During a visit to the Solid Waste and Public Cleansing Management Corporation (SWCorp) the researchers discussed illegal dumping of waste, landfill sites and imports of plastic waste with the Deputy CEO (Technical) and his team. SWCorp plan to promote initiatives aimed at increasing awareness of waste segregation at source, deposit return schemes and incentivising recycling.

The team made the most of their two weeks in the country, meeting with representatives from industry and visiting relevant sites, including:
• Touring the food waste recycling facility at Petaling Jaya, which processes around 500kg of food waste per day by means of anaerobic digestion producing biogas and fertiliser.
• Visiting Penang Hill, one of the most popular tourist attractions in the area, which generates a significant amount of waste. Wastewater recovery facilities are being introduced at the site and there are plans to develop a more sustainable solid waste management system.
• Taking part in a knowledge exchange session at the Higher Education Youth Association (HEYA), a Malaysian NGO providing training to graduates, which focused on exchanging ideas on environmental sustainability and ways of improving the quality of research and teaching in higher education. Dr Ng says, “The discussion was highly interactive and we have managed to generate several key takeaways. We are particularly pleased that after our conversations, HEYA is considering including sustainability in the education policies they are preparing for the Ministry of Higher Education”.

The researchers plan to collaborate further with many of the Malaysian agencies they met during the visit with a view to promoting circular economy and tackling the challenges relevant to solid waste management in Malaysia.

419,Consumer goods giants team up in bid to lower environmental impacts,"Consumer goods giants team up in bid to lower environmental impacts

Clorox, Procter & Gamble (P&G) and Henkel are among a group of consumer goods businesses selling cleaning products to have co-launched a campaign aimed at driving the sector towards ""net-positive"" environmental and social impact.

Called “Our Future is Clean”, the campaign is being facilitated by the American Cleaning Institute (ACI) – a business-led organization representing the US cleaning products supply chain.

The ACI estimates that, while the firms it covers represent $60bn to the global economy, they account for 0.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions – excluding emissions relating from cleaning-related activities at consumer level.

To that end, the campaign will showcase the decarbonisation progress being made by firms classed as sustainability leaders in the cleaning product sector, while also urging other firms to take more ambitious and rapid action.

The ACI claims that direct (Scope 1) and power-related (Scope 2) emissions from the cleaning product formulation sub-sector fell more than one-third (37%) between 2008 and 2018, largely through investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency and circular economy measures.

Nonetheless, 46% of ACI members do not produce public reports detailing their emissions on an annual basis, while 66% have not set time-bound numerical targets to reduce emissions, improve energy efficiency or increase the use of renewable energy.

Other key focusses for “Our Future is Clean” will be on product transparency and circular economy measures.

On the former, the ACI is pushing for its members to provide evidence to consumers that its products “have been made with respect for people and the environment” after its own survey of 1,000 US-based adults found that two-thirds did not feel knowledgeable about such information when buying their favourite products. The Institute lists more than 500 ingredients which firms should be providing more information in its Ingredient Safety Initiative to assist with this process.

And, on the circular economy, the campaign will showcase how ACI members are redesigning packaging and taking part in cross-industry collaborations in a bid to minimise their plastics footprint, while acknowledging that less than one-third (32%) are working towards a time-bound target for 100% recyclability across their plastic packaging portfolios.

“We’re pushing our members to think bigger, be fearless and implement ever-more innovative solutions,” the ACI’s president and chief executive Melissa Hockstad said.

“A meaningful commitment to operating sustainably must reach every corner of a company and every component of the supply chain,” P&G’s president of fabric care and professional for North America, Sundar Ramanm added.

“As highlighted, the ACI is stepping up on sustainability by uniting the industry around a shared vision that can move us collectively towards a brighter future for all.”",Ireland,2019.09
424,Deposit Return Scheme - gov.scot,"Legislation to establish Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme has been brought forward for public comment.

The new regulations will see the establishment of a scheme that will include aluminium and steel cans as well as drinks containers made of glass and PET plastic with a 20p deposit.

By increasing both the amount and quality of this material being recycled and reducing litter, the system will help to combat climate change as well as offering benefits to industry and the public.

“Our Deposit Return Scheme is the first national scheme of its type in the UK. It is ambitious in scale and scope, and gives the people of Scotland a clear and straightforward way to do their bit for the environment.

“Research has shown that the scheme is anticipated to reduce the £46 million spent each year on litter removal and is expected to reduce emissions equivalent to taking 85,000 cars off our roads, while also enjoying widespread public support across Scotland.

“There is a global climate emergency which demands we show ambition to tackle it and safeguard our planet for future generations. This process will enable us to fine tune our proposals to ensure that they work well for industry, retail and the public, and we will continue to work with the Implementation Advisory Group to that end. I am delighted to confirm that the regulations required to bring our Deposit Return Scheme into reality have now been laid.”

“These regulations put Scotland on track to deliver a world class deposit return scheme. Placing a 20p deposit on drinks bottles and cans shows that these materials have a value to our economy, and a cost to our climate if they are wasted.

“That 20p incentive will boost recycling and cut Scotland’s CO2e emissions, playing a part in the fightback against the climate emergency. It's little wonder that nearly four in five Scots support it. With drinks producers given the opportunity to group together to deliver the scheme, they can lead this exciting step towards a more circular economy.”

The regulations will operate under the super affirmative process and a copy of the Regulations has been published in accordance with the enabling powers in the Climate Change Act (Scotland) Act 2009. These will be available for comment by parliament and the general public until 10 December 2019.

The Scottish Government will continue to work with the Independent Advisory Group in developing our Deposit Return Scheme proposals, and will consider any representations made before bringing forward a final set of Regulations for the normal affirmative procedure, including a vote in the Scottish Parliament.

A recent survey by Zero Waste Scotland showed strong public support for the scheme, including the inclusion of glass.",Scotland,2019.09
426,Land use puts huge pressure on Earth’s resources. Here’s what needs to change,"We asked six experts in land use for their thoughts on priorities for the future.

After the Second World War, the increasing world population has made it more and more challenging to provide food security for everybody. Agriculture had to be intensified and production became dependent on hard-to-obtain chemical sources. That’s the case for the substances contained in fertilisers: for instance, nitrogen is extracted from the atmosphere with the help of fossil fuels, while phosphorous is found in rocks in China, the US, Africa and the Middle East.

We were able to make the entire food chain more efficient, but we are progressively using more natural resources (to make fertilisers) that are either in the form of rock deposit or natural gas. Animal breeding also industrialised, though we had to import enormous amounts of protein crops from South America to feed our animals because we don’t have enough protein source production in Europe. Those imported products also contain nitrogen, because proteins are actually organic nitrogen - that’s why animals need it.

As a consequence, across Europe there are areas where there is too much nitrogen and phosphorous in manure to use as fertiliser. And that’s a kind of a paradox: in Europe we don’t have enough nutrients in chemical form and we end up having too much nutrients in organic form.

Closing the nutrient loop is one of the main challenges of the century. We need to turn those inefficient nutrients from organic sources into new chemical fertilisers based on bio nutrients and thereby make the surplus useful to meet our food demand.

We need to be inclusive - Prof. Georg Winkel, European Forest Institute, Germany

Land is a scarce resource in the European Union, although there are huge differences depending on where you are. Europe’s societies use land for different purposes: food, energy, wood for material and energetic use, but also recreation, beauty and relaxation in nature. In addition, science tells us about the critical importance of land management for climate change mitigation and biodiversity. Finally, policies - to promote renewable energies and materials - will put additional pressures on land in the EU, but also globally through international trade.

To meet all these demands, integrated land management approaches (to reduce the collective environmental footprint from different uses) are needed. This is, in theory, an accepted model for land use in Europe but to implement it in practice remains a challenge. Moreover, there is also an allocation problem: most of the demand for nature and rewilding (leaving nature to take its own course) comes from the urban population of Europe’s big agglomerations, but cities consume most of the energy, material and food generated from intense management. In turn, large areas of abandoned land are found in rural regions where the population sometimes see this rather as lost territories and a sign of rural decline.

Our research on forests shows that, while the integrated management approach has great potential for many forest areas in Europe, transparency and also inclusion of society might be decisive to create trust and understanding, particularly for demands such as wood production, biodiversity conservation and recreation.

We need to rewild land - Dr Wouter Helmer, Rewilding Europe, The Netherlands

Rewilding lands could help provide all kinds of climate-related solutions. For example, with new natural areas we could better store water at the source of rivers by using these lands as a sponge that keeps the area dry during the rainy seasons and releases more water during the dry seasons. There is also a reduction in flood risk within natural areas. Finally, rewilded lands store a lot of carbon, which helps mitigate the effects of climate change.

One of the things we are currently exploring for the European Commission is the use of more natural grazing management models also as a solution to large wildfires. It’s much easier to fight fires or even to avoid fires at all, in these half-open natural lands than it is in closed scrublands or forest-monocultures.

Still, our experiences with natural systems are limited. What we really need is to create a bridge between what we know from these pioneering areas and the broader economy. At the next stage, we need to scale up and reach the financial world, so that others can understand that investing in the landscape is not only good from an environmental perspective but also very attractive.

I am optimistic, I see big steps in our thinking and the public debate moving very fast in the right direction. In the coming years it will be exciting to see how we will re-organise ourselves to solve the big climate issues.

We need to preserve soil capacity - Prof. Daniel Nahon, Aix-Marseille Université, France

Global warming will warm lands five times more than oceans, meaning that, for an average increase of world temperature of 2°C or 2.5°C, land temperature will rise about 10°C. So the great challenge of global warming is the soil and water resources, i.e. world agriculture and its food productivity.

How do we feed the world, diminish poverty and improve people’s health without adverse ecological consequences? By preserving soil capacity. Utilisation of mineral fertilisers seems to be the best solution for enlarging food production. It’s worth a try to propose a solid basis of scientific studies for rewriting the guidelines for fertilisers’ uses.

After one century of intensive agriculture, one out of seven people still go hungry, while a third of the world’s landmass is used for animal farming and production. Intensive agriculture uses 86% of freshwater, it damages the environment and farmers’ health and it impoverishes soils and biodiversity. Small farmholders cannot provide for their own livelihoods and many commit suicide.

It is critical to change toward new farming practices. This will take time, but we have lost two decades not taking into account the importance of living soils.

We need policy to help put innovations into practice - Dr Helena Gomez Macpherson, Institute for Sustainable Agriculture of the Spanish National Research Council, Spain

Conservation agriculture, which involves minimal soil disturbance, maintaining permanent soil cover and rotating crops, is promoted by many international and national institutions for conserving soil and water. It has been largely adopted in America (North and South) but little in Europe, in spite of extensive research. Similarly, there are new technologies available for improving irrigation scheduling, but few are adopted commercially. Many farmers argue that options proposed by scientists are not always effective at farm scale, that the economic return to investments is unknown and that many of these options are not user friendly.

Once the value of an innovation is proven, its adoption will mostly depend on socioeconomic context. In productive agriculture systems, farmers will be ready to try new options. For example, some of the best olive cooperatives now have their own composting plant for using the residues obtained during olive oil production aiming at a circular economy. However, farmers in low productive environments have a small window to adopt or even try new options unless they have public support.

A good policy is the most effective way to promote adoption of technology or strategies by farmers. However, this must be accompanied by transparent cost-benefit analyses that include impact on the crop, the economics and the environment in local conditions. On-farm research should play a key role in developing viable options in these terms.

We need to manage water better - Prof. Jan-Olof Drangert, Linköping University, Sweden

The 21st century will experience an unprecedented population increase and concentration to urban areas. These areas are hotspots for water and food demand and for disposal of used water and plant nutrients, which calls for a system-based (holistic) approach to balance these flows through the cities and connect to agriculture. This should guide city planning and household infrastructure investment.

The waste hierarchy, which includes liquid waste, helps to prioritise different waste management measures according to what is best for the environment. There is much water-saving equipment and many devices that can substantially reduce water use without losing personal comfort. Upstream measures, in particular to reduce the use of manufactured chemical consumer products, will facilitate treatment of wastewater to a quality that allows reuse and recycling of water and nutrients. A systems approach that applies the above two tools suggests that there is enough safe urban water available and recycled nutrients can replace a large part of chemical fertilisers. Two measures to achieve this are keeping toilet water separate and segregating biowaste.

Now is a unique opportunity to replace business as usual and invest in sustainability, when new cities and suburbs are erected at a high rate. If societies do not act now and strive for a circular society, they will most likely have to retrofit at high costs in the near future.

On 26 September, Dr Gomez MacPherson, Prof. Winkel and Prof. Meers will be participating in a session called Natural resources in a changing climate – spot on agriculture and forestry at the EU’s Research & Innovation days to help shape the scope of EU research and policy on land use from 2021 to 2027.",European Union,2019.09
429,Circular economy cleans up,"The cleaning products industry in America is being urged to step up its efforts to champion sustainable practices and products.

Launching its 2019 Sustainability Report, the American Cleaning Institute (ACI) has set out a strategy which calls for companies to take ‘bolder, collective action to achieve a cleaner world’.

“With our wide membership and their vast consumer base, ACI is ideally positioned to unite members around a shared sustainability vision. Together, we are taking the courageous steps needed to help shape our planet for decades, maybe centuries to come,” said ACI CEO Melissa Hockstad.

The endless number of cleaning products used daily by the public and commercial enterprises clearly presents major waste and pollution challenges. Preventing more plastic pollution destroying our oceans by switching to sustainable packaging solutions is one area ACI members are working on, with a third currently committed to achieving 100% recyclable packaging.

“We’re pushing our members to think bigger, be fearless and implement ever-more innovative solutions,” added Melissa. “Our new strategy combines our core strength of collaboration with a commitment to doing our part as an industry to address the sustainability challenges facing our globe.”",United Kingdom,2019.09
434,Dow and SCG to collaborate in development of plastic recycling solutions,"“Our industry and society as a whole must do a better job of capturing and reusing plastic by scaling investments in collection, waste management, recycling technologies and new end-markets,” said Jim Fitterling, CEO of Dow. “Dow continues to join forces with partners across the globe to more effectively reuse and recycle plastic waste. Working together with companies like SCG we can create a world where no plastic ends up in the environment.”

The products anticipated from this collaboration are outputs of mechanical recycling, feedstock recycling as well as renewable feedstock which include but are not limited to recycled resin, recycled products made from plastic waste, petrochemical feedstocks from plastic waste and renewable plastic resins.

“This collaboration not only represents our joint commitment in taking action to solve the problems through technology and making real changes but also provides us with new business opportunity, enhancing sustainability and bringing about practical solutions for recycling and upcycling of plastic waste in Thailand,” said Roongrote Rangsiyopash, President and CEO of SCG.

“Circular economy is an economic opportunity as much as a solution to a pressing environmental issue,” said Jonathan Penrice, President of Dow in Asia Pacific. “We will build on Dow’s unique materials science and application knowledge and our 50-year experience in Thailand to develop solutions that maximise the value of plastics in the country.”

This collaboration is aligned with the Thai government’s ambition to drastically increase the recycling rate of plastic waste in the country by 2027. Plastic waste in the environment is considered a critical environmental issue which Dow and SCG have innovated around in the past, such as developing certain technologies to incorporate materials derived from transformed plastic waste in polymer modified asphalt roads. This solution will add value to low or no value plastic waste such as multi-layer plastic packaging and contaminated plastic waste.

Most businesses today operate a linear system, whereby natural resources are extracted, transformed into products, and eventually disposed of. A circular economy, on the other hand, is aimed to reuse, renew and recycle valuable resources thereby reducing environmental impact.",United Kingdom,2019.09
444,BRIDGE for Cities 4.0: Connecting Cities through the New Industrial Revolution,"When Vietnam takes over the ASEAN chairmanship in 2020, the country outlined five priorities to be executed throughout the year. Among all, strengthening the institutional capacity of ASEAN and leveraging the Industrial Revolution 4.0 to address inequality, are the most challenging goals to be realized within a year. Other scholars such as David Hutt, meanwhile, even pointed out that Vietnam’s most important goal is to secure a united stand on the Code of Conduct to be negotiated with China this year ⸺ a consensus that if achieved, will ensure any agreement regarding the contentious South China Sea dispute to be mutually favourable for all the disputants involved.

That said, the unexpected outbreak of the COVID-19 has greatly disrupted Hanoi’s initial ambitions to drive the ASEAN agenda into new heights. Not only the global pandemic postponed the regional bloc’s summits and meetings to later dates, it also compelled leaders of all ASEAN countries to devote great focus on this outbreak at the ASEAN level. While the online Special ASEAN Summit last April was able to result in a joint statement to address the COVID-19 pandemic under the chairmanship of Vietnam, it was by no means, adequate for the country to play an active role as the ASEAN’s driver this year. Given the COVID-19’s disruption to ASEAN’s annual meetings and summits, it is not hard to see why Hanoi is seeking to extend another year of its chairmanship despite this may clash with Brunei’s preparations as the next chairman of the Southeast Asian bloc.

As the country which managed to control COVID-19 and keep it to an excessively low number of transmitted cases, Vietnam has gained an unprecedented confidence among its ASEAN peers as well as those outside of the region. As highlighted by Coleman and Sheehan, Vietnam became a new model of how a developing country can respond to COVID-19 without devoting mass resources for the purpose. Dubbed as low-cost COVID-19 strategy as coined by different scholars, the Vietnamese success stemmed on its abilities on three fronts: mobilizing all segments of society in responding to the crisis, initiating early prevention measures (mask-wearing policy, targeted testing, contact tracing and quarantine) and utilizing different technologies (website and app) for public communication.

With such coordinated measures, Vietnam has cast itself as an exemplary model in controlling the pandemic despite not having colossal resources in conducting mass testing and epidemic surveillance of South Korea, China and Singapore. As a matter of fact, the Vietnamese COVID-19 response model is a highly attractive model which can be readily emulated by other developing countries with limited resources at hand. Within ASEAN, the Vietnamese model can be replicated in Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar ⸺ countries that would need effective COVID-19 response strategy without their governments devoting huge costs for it. By occupying the ASEAN chairmanship status, its COVID-19 success resonated confidence from the whole regional bloc on its ability to play a leading role in this testing time. To take it further, such gain of confidence within ASEAN, should be further capitalized by Hanoi to implement regional agendas that would bring pragmatic returns to all member states in the short-run.

With the COVID-19 pandemic yet to be effectively controlled around the world and has the capacity to recur in the near future, no one knows how much longer would the restarted economies in the bloclast. This situation, in turn, made the ASEAN Smart Cities Network (ASCN) as reached by the Southeast Asian bloc in April 2018, an ever more important priority for immediate implementation. From Anbound’s observations, there are two reasons for such urgency.

First, with COVID-19 vaccine yet to be developed at least not in the immediate future, reduction in face-to-face engagements has become a norm of human interactions. As such, there is no other choice for ASEAN players, whether they are the governments, businesses and average citizens, but to adapt to this new norm in their daily activities. By pushing for the immediate implementation of the ASCN, Vietnam will be able to utilize technology to rejuvenate the economy and improve the lives of ASEAN citizens in the post-pandemic era.

By all means, this will establish Vietnam’s legacy as the chairman that brings ASEAN out of the socio-economic crisis that was brought by the COVIS-19 pandemic. Considering that the 36 cities have planned their strategic projects within the Smart City Action Plans document, what Hanoi could do is to call for an online meeting with the respective national leaders and relevant city mayors, and designate certain short-term goals to be realized by the end of 2020. These goals can be any easier and achievable goals in the three pillars of technological utilization, industrial automation and digitalization of economy.

Second, similar to becoming a model for COVID-19 response, Vietnam could also become another model of smart cities for the lower developing peers in ASEAN. In the course of adapting smart cities vision to its local conditions, Hanoi can share with their peers on how to kick-start smart cities governance in three different cities with three distinctive needs, namely, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Danang. As a latecomer to the smart cities game, these three Vietnamese cities have demonstrated their capabilities to prioritize smart solutions according to their local needs instead of developing all sorts of smart solutions in their localities.

Whereas Hanoi had started the iParking app for drivers and looking to venture into smart solutions in healthcare, education, transport, and tourism, Danang planned to become a green city through the adoption of smart solutions. As such, the latter’ had begun developing its natural disaster management systems that set it apart from Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. As for the southern city of Ho Chi Minh, it is planning to become the first smart city of Vietnam and placed emphasis on attaining five capabilities for achieving a comprehensive smart city: development of cloud computing infrastructure, utilization of Big Data, building of data centres, erection of security centres, and establishment of an open data ecosystem. Without question, the cost-effectiveness approach of these three Vietnamese cities, is highly relevant to those lower developing peers in ASEAN in which limited resources are available for them.

An Opportunity Not to Be Missed

Within the ASNC vision, Vietnam is provided with an opportunity (not to be missed) in leading ASEAN toward the next stage of economic development. While it may want to gain specific achievements in the other areas of South China Sea issue and ASEAN’s institutional capacity, realizing these goals requires a lot of diplomacy with the other nine member states. With a little more than half year left, it is still challenging for the country to achieve these goals despite it is not an entirely impossible endeavor to start with. Pushing for short-term goals within the ASNC vision, meanwhile, will help Vietnam to get quick result and one that is also vital for the new course of ASEAN’s economic development.",European Union,2019.09

453,How good are the UK’s councils at explaining their recycling systems? –,"Nearly a third of people who recycle don’t feel confident that they are disposing of their packaging correctly, according to a survey we ran in May 2019. There are clear differences between regions, with some councils making sure people know what to do, and others lagging behind.

We’ve taken a look at how you rate the information provided by your local council. It’s important for them to get this right – consumer confusion is one of the biggest barriers to higher rates of recycling.

We asked 1,987 people to tell us how they rate the recycling information provided by their local council, such as labeling on bins, leaflets and online help. We found significant differences between regions.

How to recycle in the UK: we answer common questions, including what recycling labels really mean and what to put in your recycling bin

According to EU targets, the UK needs to recycle at least 50% of waste from households by 2020. But recycling targets within the UK – and how far each country is towards meeting them – are varied:
• Scotland: Scotland Managing Waste Scotland aims to be a zero-waste nation, and has a 70% recycling target set for 2025. In 2017, 45.6% of Scottish waste was recycled.
• Wales: One Wales, One Planet Wales aims to be a zero-waste nation by 2050. The Welsh government has set a target for 70% of waste to be recycled by 2025. In 2017-18 it recycled 57.8% of waste – the only country to be ahead of the 50% target. Including waste that was reused or composted, this figure rose to 62%.
• Northern Ireland: Delivering Resource Efficiency Northern Ireland has set a 60% recycling target for household waste by 2020. In 2017, it managed to recycle, reuse or compost 48.1% of household waste.
• England: Resources & Waste Strategy for England The target is for 50% of household waste in England to be recycled. But in 2017, the recycling rate in England stood at 45.2%. It aims to move towards a ‘circular economy’ for recyclables.

In December 2018, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs published the recycling data for local authorities in England covering the financial year 2017/18.

The top local authority by recycling rate was East Riding of Yorkshire Council, with 64.5%. But more than 40 local authorities had a recycling rate of less than 30%.

We’ve spoken to people involved in every step of the recycling journey, from manufacturers and consumers to local authorities and waste management facilities. The conclusion was unanimous: communicating the correct recycling information to people at home is one of the biggest barriers to higher recycling rates.

There are two ways this can be improved – through local authorities and waste management firms, and through the labeling provided on packaging.

How well do councils communicate recycling information?

Nearly one in three people in our survey told us that the communication about recycling in their local area, provided by their local council, is poor.

In the North East, 35% of people told us that their local council did a poor or very poor job of communicating and distributing information about recycling, compared to just 19% in London.

One of the main difficulties local councils and consumers face is the many different recycling schemes across the country, and even within regions. People living just streets apart could have completely different recycling schemes.

Some of those we surveyed said they struggled to match the symbols on packaging with the information provided on their local councils’ website or leaflets.

Less than a third of people rated the information presented by their local council as good, although in London this figure was higher – 40% of Londoners surveyed thought it was good.

Overall, 38% of people felt their council was doing a lacklustre job of recycling education, marking it as average.

Who is responsible for collecting my recycling?

In England and Wales, two-tier local authorities (such as cities and districts) must provide household waste collection, while county councils have to handle its disposal.

If you live in a unitary authority, then it has to do both. Your local council or authority should provide information on how to recycle at home and work closely with the waste-management firms involved in collection and sorting.

What can I do at home to help recycling rates?

We want local authorities and manufacturers to make it easier for you to recycle correctly, but in the meantime there are a few key things you can do at home.

You can check your postcode at recyclenow.com to find out what types of packaging are accepted in your area, particularly if you’re confused by the information provided by your local council.

Putting dirty products such as nappies or containers with food inside into your recycling bin can cause all sorts of issues when it come to sorting and processing recycling. Putting the wrong types of packaging in it can impact the quality of the recycled material, too.

We know it can be annoying to add extra washing up to your bowl, but local councils told us that packaging contaminated with a lot of food can lead to poor-quality recycling or loads that have to be incinerated. It needs to be clean of debris, but doesn’t have to be sparkling.

We think local councils should do a better job of explaining how clean packaging should be, and why it’s important. The experts we’ve spoken to say that giving packaging a rinse is a must, and if an item is particularly coated in food – such as a baked bean tin – then pop it in leftover washing-up water to get rid of the worst of it.

Reduce the amount of plastic packaging you buy

In a recent investigation, we found that up to 29% of supermarket packaging is not recyclable, and we found some supermarkets seem to be taking the problem more seriously than others. Follow our list of tips to reduce your plastic use, including simple swaps such as investing in the best reusable water bottle, using reusable storage containers such as tupperware, and picking loose fruit and veg over packaged where you can.",United Kingdom,2019.09
455,Ghana Heralds New Era for Plastic Pollution Action in Africa,"Ghana will become the first country in Africa to sign up to the World Economic Forum’s Global Plastic Action Partnership (GPAP) in a bid to address the nation’s mounting plastic waste and pollution challenge.

As one of the world’s fastest growing economies, Ghana is regarded as a regional leader in entrepreneurship and innovation. This rapid expansion of economic activity has brought with it a mounting plastic waste and pollution challenge.

GPAP will fast-track progress on these fronts by working with Ghana’s public, private and civil society sectors to steer the transition towards a circular economy in which plastics are manufactured, used and re-used sustainably. It will also support and develop locally led initiatives by creating a platform to facilitate knowledge sharing, connect like-minded actors and scale up best practices to the national, regional and global level.

“Our partnership with the Global Plastics Action Partnership will bring together new and existing efforts to spark off innovation and achieve progress at a tremendous scale,” said Professor Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng, Ghana’s Minister of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation. “Our success will propel Ghana to emerge as a regional leader on the issue of plastic pollution reduction and inspire other nations to act through sharing our knowledge and lessons. Ultimately, we hope that this will mark the beginning of a new era of action on plastic waste and pollution across the African continent.”

“Under the leadership of President Akufo-Addo and Minister Frimpong-Boateng, Ghana is sending a clear signal that it is prepared to play a leading role in tackling the scourge of plastic waste and pollution not just at the national level but also across Africa. The Global Plastic Action Partnership is proud to assist the country in this role by facilitating public-private collaboration, assisting in scaling up solutions and sharing best practices from around the world,” said Kristin Hughes, Director of the Global Plastic Action Partnership at the World Economic Forum.

Ghana stands at the junction of unparalleled growth and potential. On track to achieve the fastest economic growth among all nations in 2019, it has also shown remarkable leadership in championing new efforts to boost sustainability across its businesses, rejuvenate its natural environment, and promote the wellbeing and livelihoods of its people. At the same time, insufficient infrastructure to manage and reduce waste has led to unsustainable levels of pollution and leakage, putting the wellbeing of both Ghana’s people and biodiversity at risk. Urgent and collective action is needed to address this challenge.

Ghanaians have reacted energetically to this challenge. The government has implemented a National Plastics Management Policy to address the unsustainable adoption of single-use plastic. It has also signalled a willingness to pioneer new approaches to plastic material design, recycling and waste management infrastructure, and the integration of sustainable business practices throughout value chains. A number of circular economy and waste management initiatives have also been established at the local level. The United Nations Development Programme will act as a key partner and adviser and is expected to launch an initiative designed to empower waste resource recovery efforts. GPAP’s role will be to provide a platform allowing those involved in these diverse initiatives to collaborate, share best practices and scale up solutions.",European Union,2019.09
474,UK resources council extends consultation deadline on sector deal,"The UK Resources Council (UKRC) has today (6 September) announced an extension to its consultation on the content of a Sector Deal.

All of the consultation responses are anonymised and the author of any direct response that UKRC/Anthesis may wish to use verbatim will be contacted in advance for permission.

Chair of the UK Resources Council, David Palmer-Jones, said: “We have been very pleased with the level of engagement with the Sector Deal consultation since it was launched last month and would like to thank all of those who have participated so far.

“The resources and waste sector is a very broad and diverse sector, with a large number of stakeholders, but we are also intrinsically linked through the circular economy with the many sectors for which we provide services, products and secondary materials.

“To ensure we are able to capture as much as we can of this rich and diverse experience, we have taken the decision to extend the consultation deadline by three weeks.

“I would like to take the opportunity again to encourage individuals and organisations to have their say, and to help shape this deal, which could help our sector unlock its true economic potential.”

In August, UKRC published its initial proposals for a potential Sector Deal between the resources sector and UK Government, which aims to unlock the sector’s full potential as a vital contributor to a circular economy; net zero carbon targets; and the Green-Growth agenda in the United Kingdom.

Once again, this year ACR+ was highly active during the EU Green Week, this time being even recognized as an official Associate. The 2019 edition looked at:
• None various challenges related to applying EU environmental legislation in different sectors
• None the benefits correct implementation can bring to both the economy and society
• None and how to motivate all actors, including citizens, to take initiative.

During the 2019 Green Week, ACR+ and several of its members helped organise the opening session, the European Week for Waste Reduction (EWWR) award ceremony, but also supported events on topics such as:

ACR+ and some of its members also contributed actively to the Urban Future Global Conference (UFGC) 2019 from 22 to 24 May 2019. The UFGC 2019, which took place in Oslo, the European Green Capital 2019, enabled passionate and inspiring city changers from all over the world to meet and exchange about their good practices, doubts, failures and successes. Circular economy was one of the hot topics of this edition, with ACR+ moderating a session on Circular economy best practice from cities. During that session, ACR+ members Brussels, Maribor and Aalborg showcased how to get started with circular economy and some of their amazing projects.

The ACR+ has also participated in a variety of conferences and events in order to promote good examples and approaches on circular economy from cities and regions, with tourism often being a focal theme. At the UrbanWINS final conference (4 April 2019, Brussels), ACR+ hosted a workshop on Community based decision making for better waste management in tourism, while on 16 May 2019 in Paris the association hosted an ORDIF Technical discussion about the management of tourism related waste, and shared its view on how public authorities can promote sustainable tourism and local loops of circular economy at the 18 June 2019 URBELAC meeting in Maribor.

Other events where ACR+ furthered the circular economy include the Urban Agenda Partnership on Circular Economy meeting (28-29 March 2019, Oslo), the TRiFOCAL conference (14 June 2019, Dublin), where ACR+ discussed challenges of food waste for urban authorities, as well as the Paris International Stewardship Conference (2-4 July 2019, Paris), where ACR+ presented the state of the art of EPR in the EU legal context.",European Union,2019.09

502,ROSI start-up offers silicon recycling technology demonstrating a circular economy for PV industry,"The launch of law on energy transition has an extensive and fundamental influence on various aspects in Europe, including financing, energy efficiency, renewable energy deployment, nuclear power phase down, competitiveness, R&D and innovation. In that regard, Photovoltaic (PV) energy is one of the most important renewable energy sources which can be exploited on small (KW) and large scale (MW-GW) to satisfy the diversified needs of a developing Europe. As an example, the launching of ‘PlanSolaire’ by EDF has the ambition to have 30GW PV in France between 2020 and 2035, which opens the hope in Europe for a bright PV future. However, the loss of PV grade silicon, associated with the waste of a large amount of energy and CO during the process of wafering is the last technical and industrial bottleneck to overcome in order to render the large-scale PV production green, and environmentally friendly. It is within this context that ROSI has developed a world-leading process which gives the best quality of the recycled silicon, which then can be re-integrated in the PV production value chain at several different places. This development was possible with the hard work carried out together with the laboratory of SIMap in Grenoble, France and EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland.

By implementing this process at the industrial scale, ROSI will boost the raw materials lifecycle and increase renewable energy production efficiency by eliminating the industrial waste produced during the production value chain. As a result, the production cost of PV energy will be decreased, with reduced CO emission and energy consumption, leading to a much ‘greener’ European innovation ecosystem. With the successful exploitation of the silicon recycling technology for the ambitious expansion plan of PV production in Europe, the role of Europe as an innovation-driven continent will also be reinforced. The associated job creation will be another plus for this virtuous business.

As all the founders of ROSI have a technical and industrial background, they all recognise that the support of Europe is one of the best ways to develop and bring innovative technologies to the market. The subject of ROSI is in the scope of ‘Raw Materials’ and, therefore, the start-up contacted EIT RawMaterials for being channelled into the well-developed series of programmes in order to have the most straightforward way for the go-to-market, under the guidance and coaching of the experts in the network. As a result, during the phase of the foundation of the company, ROSI participated in the EIT Jumpstarter (former Business Idea Competition) and benefited greatly from the coaching program, which allowed ROSI team to have a better understanding on the market sectors. On top of that, ROSI was the winner of the EIT Jumpstarter 2017 in the sector of recycling and circular economy. Afterwards, according to the elaborated development plan, ROSI advanced in its market development discussion with targeted partners, respectively Total New Energies, to be technically integrable for PV, as well as Veolia, to exploit on an industrial scale according to the norms and specifications. In parallel, ROSI was selected for the EIT RawMaterials Start-up and SME Booster 2018, and funded by EIT RawMaterials to scale-up the technology to a TRL 6 to facilitate business with targeted customers. Today, a combined offer by ROSI and Total New Energy is ready to be proposed to the market. ROSI and Veolia are also further discussing the exploitation of the technology on the industrial scale. All these market developments have been carried out in parallel to the exchange of ROSI with the EIT RawMaterials Innovation Community. Furthermore, Yun Luo, Co-founder and CEO at ROSI, was also nominated for the EIT Woman Award 2018 that recognises the outstanding achievements of women entrepreneurs and leaders from the EIT Innovation Community.",European Union,2019.09
506,Australian Trade Body Calls for Unified Voice on Importance of Waste to Energy,"The Australian Industrial Ecology Network (AIEN) has urged State Governments, the resource recovery industry, and all stakeholders to find a unified voice on the issue of Energy from Waste (EfW) in Australia and its importance in the context of a circular economy.

In a recently released report, The Role of Energy from Waste in a Circular Economy: Creating a stable project structure, the organisation said that the implementation of EfW in the Australian framework should be streamlined, so that each State acts in accordance with a nationally developed policy framework.

“We recognise and acknowledge the hard work of each State Government (thus far) in preparing a response to the EfW opportunity by issuing public consultation drafts for their respective EfW guidelines,” said Chair of the AIEN, Colin Barker.

“However, what we find difficult to accept, is that in spite the myriad of issues currently surrounding the management of waste and resource recovery in this country, our regulators still cannot approach this potentially ‘brand new to Australia’ industry with a view towards a standard Australia-wide approach,” he continued.

Within the concept of a circular economy, the AIEN said that it recognises the need for recovery of materials prior to assessing opportunities for EfW technologies, with already well-established and emerging processes and supply chains available for the recycling/reuse of mixed plastics, rubber, glass, timber and aggregates – among others – as valuable resources in higher value-added product markets.

“The AIEN endorses the concept of Highest Net Resource Value (HNRV) as worthy of detailed consideration and promotion. It is a concept enshrined within the waste hierarchy, but with a more tangible and measurable output,” commented Barker.

HNRV reflects an approach that seeks to achieve or retain the highest possible resource value from the materials under consideration, ‘net’ of the cost and effort to achieve such an outcome. The waste hierarchy is normally presented only in the context of environmental/social good. The AIEN, however, has re-imagined the waste hierarchy as representing the notional value applied to a given ‘resource’.

“Any failure to properly consider the importance of the waste hierarchy and HNRV principles may result in losses in the long term through stranded investment.

“When resource or material availability becomes a constraint, resources will always flow to those who can afford to pay the most for them,” Barker added.

In its report, the AIEN sets out a number of recommendations in relation to the requisite ‘five pillars’ for success for an EfW project in Australia. The five pillars are:

“Failure to ensure that appropriately developed and defined strategies are established for each of these five pillars, during – and for each sequential stage of the multi-stage project development process – could be catastrophic for any project, running the risk of effects from the commonplace phenomenon often described by the proverbial ‘Fire-Ready-Aim’,”concluded Barker.

What is your role?

I am the Vice President of Sustainability at Tetra Pak and in my 20 years here, sustainability has always been at the core of our brand promise to protects what’s good. Contributing to the achievement of the SDGs is a key aspect of delivering our sustainability commitments at Tetra Pak and as such, the goals have been incorporated into roles that extend beyond mine including our business strategy, day-to-day operations and dealings with our stakeholders.

Please share what you’ll be speaking on at the Transform Summit and why it’s important for you to be speaking at this event?

I look forward to speaking as part of the Transitioning From a Linear to a Circular Strategy session at the Transform Summit as this is an area of focus for Tetra Pak in line with our commitment to achieving a low carbon and climate neutral circular economy. I plan to share what we have learnt here at Tetra Pak, and how we have evolved our focus and resource allocation accordingly. Partnerships are a key way we do business and together, using Transform as a platform, we can drive change through discussion, collaboration, and supporting a low-carbon circular economy.

Business must implement innovative and disruptive change to achieve their GHG emission targets. How can companies transform the business to deliver the required positive change whilst sustaining business growth?

One way companies can transform their business is by holding themselves accountable by setting environmental targets and making public commitments to implement change. For example, in 2011 we set a climate goal to cap our 2020 impact across our value chain at 2010 levels, regardless of business growth and in 2016 Tetra Pak made a public commitment to RE100 to source 100 percent renewable electricity by 2030. To deliver positive change while sustaining business growth, we are evaluating how Tetra Pak can directly initiate new renewable projects in the regions where we operate and working closely with suppliers to identify efficiencies both in their operations and through their own supply.

Implementing a circular system across your operations is no easy task. Improving your products, trying new materials and changing your operations generate costs and risks to the business. How can companies mainstream a circular system?

In order to support a low-carbon circular economy, we have chosen to focus on four key areas of our business: delivering packaging with the lowest comparable carbon footprint, delivering highly efficient equipment and solutions, minimising our operational impact and working with partners to dramatically increase recycling and reuse. To mainstream a circular system, our approach has been to benchmark our top performing sites across our global operations, capturing good practice and ensuring that it is applied systematically across the company. Further to achieve our commitment, we are delivering solutions with the lowest carbon footprint and highest efficiency, minimising the environmental impact on our own operations, across our value chain and working with partners to address the end-of-life of our products.

For most companies, their greatest risks and impacts lie within their supply chains. To truly address areas such as: GHG emissions, Human Rights violations and Water usage companies need to work with a whole host of partners. How can business drive large-scale change in partnership with industry associations, NGOs, competitors and Governments?

The circular economy requires collaboration at every stage of a product’s lifecycle – from sourcing and product design, to consumer awareness, collection and sorting, to recycling and reuse. While innovations along the value chain are an important foundation, transformational change requires a step up from everyone and we depend on partnerships across industries, governments and NGOs to make this happen. For example, we recently launched paper straws for beverage cartons in Europe and decided to put our new paper straw into the public domain (without patent) to encourage industry collaboration on the alternatives to single use plastic straws for beverage cartons.

512,Living Well With Plastics: The Politics of the Plastics Crisis,"Over the last few years, plastics have very rapidly become one of the most pressing environmental concerns, moving from decades of anonymity in the public consciousness to a sudden and powerful revolt against what used to be a mundane material. Politicians, businesses, and environmental organizations have quickly picked up on this wave of public outrage and are reacting with a dizzying variety of initiatives to tackle the plastic problem. In this WIREs review, the authors take up the task of organizing and systematizing these responses to provide researchers, policymakers, and interested citizens with an overview of the politics of the plastics crisis.

The article looks mainly at existing, published research that engages with plastics in political terms, for example, by identifying the scale and scope of problems, laying out the negative impacts, suggesting solutions, or apportioning blame and responsibilities. First, it moves through the plastics life cycle, from upstream production toward downstream consumption, waste management, and pollution. Here the authors point out that most of the attention toward plastics as a political problem accrues to mismanaged waste plastics that become marine litter. Second, the article investigates how the politics of plastics have been manifested in relation to a series of specific plastic objects: bags, bottles, microplastics (mainly microbeads and textiles), and single-use plastics (especially packaging). Attention to plastic objects has, according to the authors, moved from a focus on more easily governed objects (e.g., bags, bottles, and microbeads in cosmetics) toward addressing more complex ones (e.g., food packaging, textiles, and tires).

After the review of politics along the life cycle and around contested objects, the authors stress that the most ambitious current policy initiatives do not restrict themselves to individual stages of the life cycle or categories of objects—instead, ambitions are moving toward collecting several flows and objects into more coherent and systemically oriented strategies.

Two main trends are identified: circular economy initiatives and global plastic conventions. Circular economy policies are focused on the economy, industry, production, and disposal on or pollution of terrestrial land (as opposed to plastics in the ocean). The emphasis is on turning waste plastics into new input for plastic production, and these policies are mainly led by businesses or rely heavily on their involvement. On the other hand, global plastic conventions or treaties, which tend to be intergovernmental in origin, focus on pollution, waste, microplastics, and marine litter. These initiatives are originally much more directly linked to the acute problems experienced by marine and coastal ecosystems and communities but over time advance toward more broad-spectrum approaches to the plastics crisis.

The key finding in this review is that the whole plastics life cycle is political, but it has not yet been equally politicized. While the scientific literature has drawn attention to sustainability problems at all stages of the plastics life cycle, it emphasizes plastic waste and marine pollution, and this is also where public and policy attention is primarily fixed.

We need more integrated perspectives and initiatives that tackle the politics of plastics throughout the entire life cycle—from production, through consumption, to waste and pollution. Upstream conditions matter for downstream possibilities. For instance, if the debate continues to constrain itself to marine plastic pollution, plastic producers may feel free to ramp up the total supply of plastics entering the system while attention remains fixed on straws, cup lids, and sea turtles. In light of projections that estimate a doubling of global plastic production within 15 years, this is becoming an urgent and necessary debate that should not be overlooked.

In general, the authors conclude that the politics of the plastic crisis have paid too little attention to how the material properties and environmental problems of plastic are inextricably bound up with our dominant systems of production and consumption, thus facilitating and maintaining societies of disposability and over-consumption. In pursuit of a sustainable relationship to plastics, the review argues for the necessity of engaging more directly with two themes in particular:
• Norms and practices that maintain the role of plastics in society;
• and the political and economic arrangements that secure its overabundance and low price.",Germany,2019.09
515,Zero Waste Europe Study on Chemical Recycling of Plastics,"Zero Waste Europe has published a study into the chemical recycling of plastics which closes with policy recommendations to ensure the technology complements, rather than jeopardises, a real Circular Economy.

The organisation said that the study comes at a time when Chemical Recycling (CR) is being promoted by industry as a potential solution to waste management and specifically plastic pollution, and looks into the information available as well as the state of implementation of such technologies in the European context.

Whilst making it clear that the real solution to plastic pollution lies in prevention and reuse measures, and an overall reduction in plastic use, the report notes that plastic cannot be endlessly mechanically recycled without reducing its properties and quality, and that not all plastic types can be mechanically recycled. These limits set challenges for plastics recycling and show the need for significant improvements in the end-of-life management of plastics.

According to the report, Chemical Recycling could be a complementary solution to mechanical recycling where the latter is unsuited to materially recover plastic because it is too degraded, contaminated or too complex. On the flipside, it could also become the new plastics ‘El Dorado’if plastic to fuels is allowed.

The authors state that it should also be taken into account that Chemical Recycling is not yet a mature technology, and is not viable in the short term and this is a key factor to consider when designing the EU Circular Economy.

The report emphasises the importance of setting up the right policy framework in order to accommodate CR as complementary to mechanical recycling and to ensure that carbon stays in the plastic and is not released into the environment.

For this to happen ZWE recommends the following amendments to current waste legislation:
• Come up with a clear definition of CR that excludes any operation that does not result in the production of new plastic
• Only processes with a lower carbon footprint than the production of plastic from virgin feedstock can be classified as CR
• CR should be used to deal with degraded and contaminated plastics and never with plastics coming from separate collection
• Establish verification systems to ensure CR process outputs plastic and plastic feedstocks; facilities licensed for chemical recycling should not produce fuel as primary output
• In order to avoid competition with mechanical recycling, but also to differentiate from recovery and disposal operations, a new level in the waste hierarchy should be added for those operations that recover materials from mixed waste that today would end up burned or landfilled.
• For coherence with EU Climate and Circular Economy agendas, EU funding should only be allowed to finance plastic to plastic chemical operations.

“The Chemical Recycling hype should not divert attention from the real solution to plastic pollution which is replacing single-use plastics, detoxifying and simplifying new plastics, and designing business models to make efficient use of plastics,” said Joan Marc Simon, Executive Director, Zero Waste Europe.

The report found that CR can have a role to play in closing the material loop and moving away from disposal and recovery operations, up the waste hierarchy. However, the best option to Kerb plastic pollution from an environmental and economic perspective is to invest in reduction and reuse solutions and ensure that no plastic escapes the material loop via plastic to fuels.

ZWE argued that allowing plastic to fuels to be considered CR risks creating a loophole in EU Climate and Circular Economy legislation.

To further investigate how Chemical Recycling could fit into a real Circular Economy, ZWE is going to organise a webinar to present the findings of this study, give voice to an industry representative and analyse the policy framework possibilities.
